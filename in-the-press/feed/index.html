		<description>Lol good for you. Maybe consider that entire "seo" bullshit is mostly wasted time ? It's not like those numbers are very accurate or all that representative in the first place. To put it another way, the 2nd part of that compounding has a lot to do with reading up on such bullshits in the first place.</description>

		<description>It's very interesting to look at the data for your site. You're right now Alexa rank # 6,516 worldwide but only # 6,854 in India. This means Indian traffic is a larger part of the world wide web traffic than the 9.4% that visit here. India has almost 16% of the whole world population, so it has less Internet access than is average. This is the bad thing with poverty: so India not only has less access than normal, it does even less with the little it has than normal, like a poor person not only has less money than average but also spends it with less ROI than average.
I am from India and I read here every day!</description>

		<description>In other lulz, recent data shows you are actually larger than 85% -- 12 (&lt;a href="https://archive.is/k4SX1"&gt;wired.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://archive.is/XmDjk"&gt;theregister.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://archive.is/HRbWy"&gt;arstechnica.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://archive.is/Re82N"&gt;libertatea.ro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://archive.is/RY4Y8"&gt;dailydot.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://archive.is/c82hm"&gt;antena3.ro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://archive.is/Z1D0k"&gt;gawker.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://archive.is/rrzmI"&gt;mediafax.ro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://archive.is/HodBt"&gt;gandul.ro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://archive.is/lVxeT"&gt;evz.ro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://archive.is/Nbdky"&gt;a1.ro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://archive.is/NU9gT"&gt;techmeme.com&lt;/a&gt;) out of the 14 -- news sites listed here. 

I suppose they should be thankful they linked Trilema way back whenever, 2015, since it turns out that way they get a link back that's worth &lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2020/babydoll-living-dat-pimp-life/?b=omg%20this%20is%20worth&#38;e=life#select"&gt;more than their life&lt;/a&gt;.

PS. theregister.co.uk meanwhile became theregister.com, if you care.</description>
