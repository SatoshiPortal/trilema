		<description>66.&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; million ? 

No. 

Not for 1337 million, either. Dollars are &lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2016/sad-times-in-the-fiat-empire-apparently-you-cant-give-the-dollar-away-these-days/"&gt;useless&lt;/a&gt; anyways.</description>

		<description>&gt; please tell what's this website for? 
&gt; what is the purpose of this sight?

Principally, for me to read when I'm older. 

Back before &lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2020/closure/"&gt;the closure&lt;/a&gt; it also had substantial public discourse utility, in that it allowed me to mark down for public consumption sophisticated reasoning and complex arguments in the most compact of forms by use of reference. It still privately retains that utility, particularly in the training of harem slavegirls, both new and old ; but with the destructuring of the very notion of a public it obviously lost any aspect of a public good. 

&gt; yes the website is good.

Cool.

&gt; I'm from sri lanka I'm a male. how can i contribute to this website? 

I can't think of anything.</description>
