<p>It is the sort of bug that's always hardest to notice, because "it works for me" ; and it doesn't work for you coincidentally, now and again -- it is <em>engineered</em>, and <b>with malice aforethought</b> to work for you, and you only.

<p>So here I spent untold months in aspie heaven, imagining I'm actually using bidirectional links, while everyone else saw the same thing... some of the time. Can you believe that crap ?!</p>

<blockquote><p>
<a href=http://btcbase.org/log/2019-07-19#1923787>asciilifeform</a>: when i was sawing the thing apart , thought 'why not make selector search for start/end chars until finds unique, then sel displayer ditto' but did not get to trying this</p></blockquote>
<p>This is good for many reasons, that all reduce to "kicking USG tendrils out of republican process". That nobody needs javascript to see a selection anymore is a thing of beauty ; that nobody needs javascript to produce a selection anymore is the other thing of beauty. Those were the last two uses known for javascript (the archive selector has proper html fallback, so it's merely a convenience, and one I intend to throw out, at that). This means... well, it means I will be able to run the shitty gfx browsers in no-js mode! Holy hell finally!

<p><b>III. The resolution.</b> MP's own PHP grenadiers regiment implemented the solution "overnight"<sup><a href="#footnote_2_85471" id="identifier_2_85471" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I'm in Minsk, nights come at a strange time here.">iii</a></sup>, and so now we have resolution!</p>
<p>To apply this to your own blog, you will first need to edit your root level .htaccess<sup><a href="#footnote_3_85471" id="identifier_3_85471" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Generally this is found in domain/www or domain public_html or such.">iv</a></sup> :</p>
<blockquote><p>- RewriteRule (.*) /index.php [L]<br />
+ RewriteRule (.*) /index.php [QSA,L]
</p></blockquote>
<p>QSA stands for Query String Append, see the <a href=http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewriterule>mod_rewrite manual</a> for all sorta intricately detailed views of that strange ad-hoc scripting language.</p>
<p>Then the following goes into your <em>theme's</em> functions.php. This is <b>not</b> the blog-wide functions.php as found in wp-includes, but the theme's own function.php as found in /wp-content/themes/&lt;name>/ ; don't ask me about the brilliant naming conventions involved, I had no hand.</p>
<blockquote><pre>// This does the server-side selection

add_filter('the_content', 'server_side_selection');

function server_side_selection($content){
//bookend code goes here
  $b_code = '&lt;span style="background-color:#d3d3d3" id="select">';
  $b_code .= $_GET["b"];
  $e_code = $_GET["e"].'&lt;/span>';

//change page ; last to first to preserve indexes.
  $b_pos = strpos($content,$_GET["b"]);
  $e_pos = strpos($content,$_GET["e"], $b_pos);
  if ($e_pos>0)
    $content = substr_replace($content, $e_code, $e_pos, strlen($_GET["e"]));

    $content = substr_replace($content, $b_code, $b_pos, strlen($_GET["b"]));
  return $content;
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>There are some user-tunable knobs in there, let's go through the list :</p>
<ol>
<li>You can adjust the magic words b &#038; e, as well as the magic word "select" so as to have your page respond to differently formatted url calls. I would advise against fucking with this, so as to achieve ecosystem standardization -- there's conceivably some residual benefit for the user being able to predict which knobs work on a blog he's never seen before.</li>
<p>
<li>background-color:#<b>d3d3d3</b> will happily take any color you wish to use and apply it as background for the selected text ; obviously further hackery is available there at no detriment, you can have whatever style in the style tag you wish.</li>
<p>
<li>The usage of "span" could be replaced, such as for instance with div. The disadvantage of span is that, being an inline element, it will not cross paragraphs (or &lt;li> borders for that matter). The disadvantage of div is that being a block level element, it will break lines around its starting and ending point. This latter behaviour seems to me a worse trade-off than the short range span, but ymmv. </li>
<p>
<li>MP-WP calling convention permits you to add an if(is_single()) conditional to modulate the behaviour to only articles, and such shenanigans. I do not see the utility here, but the hooks are available. You can similarily add conditionals before the first line, to have the whole process only apply in certain conditions (eg, only allow some users to view/produce selections, though I can't imagine why you'd want this).</li>
</ol>
<p>I am of course very much interested in hearing battlefield reports.</p>
<p><b>IV. The conclusion</b> is that <b>it never pays to play along</b>. Phf tried to play along with a pantsuit coven and got his asshole torn apart for his trouble. <b>By a tree</b>. That shit <em>hurts</em>. </p>
<p>I thought I was special and bright and smart and etcetera ; I thought I can use the empire's tools to deliver marginal benefit. I was wrong. </p>
<p>Consider that since introducing that selection thing back on <a href=http://trilema.com/2015/that-spiffy-selection-thing/>May 9th, 2015</a>, a number of reader man-hours were saved by having it there ; and a number of my own man-hours were employed to produce the compatible links -- opening pages, selecting snippets, pasting modified urls...</p>
<p>Today I find myself in the unenviable position of... having to replace them all. Take a look at this : </p>
<blockquote><p>| sum(ROUND((LENGTH(post_content)-LENGTH(REPLACE (post_content, "#selection-", "")))/11)) |<br />

<p>Twenty-seven <b>thousand</b> links. Even if you could do one link a second, which you can't do, it's still one day's hard work. Was it worth it ?

						<p>This method unfortunately does not mix well with links.

If you look at the source, </p>
<blockquote><p>li&gt;&lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2019/thelastpsychiatristcom-advancing-paternal-age-and-bipolar-disorder-adnotated/"&gt;&lt;span style="background-color:#d3d3d3"&gt;&lt;a name=select&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Advancing Paternal Age And Bipolar Disorder&lt;/a</p></blockquote>
<p>The anchor name tag closer closes the link anchor, because anchors can not be nested. You could maybe alter the code so it piggybacks on an open a tag if present, but that will still not permit scrolling to anything but the opening of that a tag (span will still work midway though).</p>

						<p>@<b>Stanislav Datskovskiy</b> This is pretty fucking bizarre... do the page sources show the &lt;a anchor ?</p>
<p>O holy shit, it WAS restricted to my local network. So everyone was "nfi what he's on about" because looking from here. Sorry about that.</p>
<p>@<b>Anon #1</b> This is true, but in the end anchors are supposed to be points, not fields. It's mildly annoying a selection can never include a link, but I see no way around it currently so I guess will have to live with it.</p>
<p>@<b>Anon #2</b> This strikes me rather like operator error. Could just add a character to the delimiters and not have the problem at all.</p>

						<p>@<strong>Anon #1</strong> Browsers will alternatively scroll to any element with an id matching what is specified after the # in the url. Instead of including an empty &lt;a name="selection"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tag you could add a unique id to the &lt;span&gt;. This gets around the issue with selections within links.</p>

						<p>Incidentally, this new selection mechanism is bringing into my life a very keen new awareness of the importance of tags for text! </p>
<p>Consider <a href="http://trilema.com/2017/is-it-still-rape-if-i-write-science-on-my-penis-first/?b=the%20entire&#038;e=up.#select">http://trilema.com/2017/is-it-still-rape-if-i-write-science-on-my-penis-first/?b=the%20entire&#038;e=up.#select</a> : it's not practical to select just the bolded part ; but as it happens, it's very useful to select the following part. So this means that for once (and unawaredly) I actually put the border for bolding in just the right spot.</p>
<p>Did it ever occur to you before there's right and wrong places to bold/italicize ? I mean specifically, not vaguely &#038; generally, "I know it when I see it"-ly. Verbalizably, here but not there for this reason not that reason. Hm ?</p>

						<p>In the browser's I've tried your generated links are not url encoding the whitespaces with + or %20, they are just omitting them. For example the pingback for diana_coman's "How my blog moved.." puts b=andt instead of b=and%20t in the url, and thus nothing is selected when I follow the link.</p>

						<p>I do not think it is a browser issue. The browsers will turn spaces into %20's </p>
<p>The links on trilema being displayed for the comments made via pingback already have their spaces stripped. </p>

<p>Diana_Coman sent <a href="http://trilema.com/2019/proper-html-linking-the-crisis-the-solution-the-resolution-conclusion/#comment-131889" >a pingback</a> to _this_ post from her post titled How My Blog Moved North (to the USA)</p>
<p>The excerpt that the pingback provided begins with</p>
<p>"and the wasteful padding of single-post..."</p>
<p>The code on trilema's server uses that excerpt to generate the b value for the pingback linkback. That code, for an unknown reason, is stripping the space between "and" and "the" and providing the b value</p>
<p>b=andt</p>
<p>the full link that it generates is:</p>

						<p>Come to think about it, 4 leading character might also be too narrow.</p>
<p>Also, I checked, and indeed the code does remove whitespace somehow. Nfi how or why atm, will have this looked into some.</p>

						<p>I'll roll this into a proper vpatch shortly, but for now a simple fix is to add the following line under the original fix to mlrpc.php:</p>
<p>$comment_author_url = str_replace(' ', '%20', $comment_author_url);</p>
<p>What was happening was that the data in '$comment_author_url' was being sent through the 'clean_url()' function in 'wp-includes/formatting.php', which stripped the spaces. This fix allows those spaces to get through unmolested.</p>

+                $comment_author_url = $pagelinkedfrom.rawurlencode($select_tail);</code></p>
