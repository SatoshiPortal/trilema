<p>Catfish is a movie about a guy who has a facebook relationship with a woman, and then goes to meet her and discovers... should I say "spoilers below?"</p>
<p>Spoil what? "The twist ending!" What twist?

<p>But you're not watching this movie for the twist.

<p>The truth is that "Megan" is really "Angela": a middle age, middle America homely housewife with a facebook account. What does it all mean? Cue obligatory "on the internet, no one knows you're a dog."</p>
<p>II. </p>
<p>And<sup><a href="#footnote_6_87435" id="identifier_6_87435" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="gawker.com/5646558/catfish-and-the-death-of-online-anonymity">vii</a></sup> :</p>
<blockquote><p>But what's most interesting about <em>Catfish</em> isn't that the Internet allowed a smart filmmaker to be bamboozled for months by a make-believe Michigan family. It's that the Internet allowed him to figure it out, track them down and make a movie about it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Funny, that's not what I thought was interesting. Maybe it was the subtitles, but the Korean bootleg I saw was about three megalomaniacs who actually believed it was completely ok to go a woman's house in the middle of the night, unannounced.</p>
<p><a href="http://trilema.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/catfish-looking-in-garage.jpg"><img src="http://trilema.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/catfish-looking-in-garage-560x315.jpg" alt="catfish-looking-in-garage" title="catfish-looking-in-garage" width="560" height="315" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-87438" /></a></p>
<p>Don't be sucked in by the perspective, which in the movie is all theirs. Pretend you're the coroner: two people are reading the other's potentially unreliable online information, and one of them starts driving towards the other. Is that the version you saw in the theater? That's the real plot of the movie, and when you're able to see it like that you see that the true problem of online contact isn't what's posted online but who is reading. If a murderer posts a fake bikini facebook photo, and you show up at his house with suntan oil and a inflated expectations, <i>you're</i> the problem.<sup><a href="#footnote_7_87435" id="identifier_7_87435" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="And if he told you to jump down the well...">viii</a></sup></p>
<p>The problem of perspective is the true caution of the movie, missed by everyone. We value Nev's perspective more because he made the movie, but also because it features (not just uses) cameras, Google Maps, all of which are signals of neutrality, objectivity<sup><a href="#footnote_8_87435" id="identifier_8_87435" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Nope, they're not that. They're signs of Inca appartenance, is what they are, and you're trained to open wide like a good whore.
Nothing wrong with being a good whore, of course. But do yourself the courtesy of finding better owners. Whoring out for generations' worth of accreted stupidity is easily the worst thing you could be doing with yourself.">ix</a></sup>. If someone else made the movie about him and these events, you'd be aware of his insanity immediately. But by cleverly making the movie a POV, you're drawn into seeing things only his way.<sup><a href="#footnote_9_87435" id="identifier_9_87435" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Right ?">x</a></sup> </p>
<p>Even the above Gawker critic couldn't <i>not</i> see it from Nev's perspective.<sup><a href="#footnote_10_87435" id="identifier_10_87435" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Not a matter of `seeing` anything, the farmed chicken-jews aren't there to `see` anything. They pound pound pound the party line, which happens to be anti `anonymity online` for complicated reasons we won't go into here (but in summary : because being `anti` something that's nonsense in the first place (and harmful in all cases) they can drive the inept menalone into chasing nonsense thereby feeding the inca-support cycle).">xi</a></sup> Of course the woman lied to him, but didn't he then turn and force himself into her real life only to make a movie? Isn't that worse? Make no mistake, this is a documentary of narcissism supported by the Apple catalog<sup><a href="#footnote_11_87435" id="identifier_11_87435" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Quite exactly. Isn't it remarkable how close the manalone can get to anything without actually ever getting there ?">xii</a></sup>. If there was any movie that exemplified "a narcissist is one who sees himself as the main character in his own movie, and everyone else is merely supporting cast," it's <i>Catfish</i>. At one point he's frustrated by how his director-brother is pushing him to continue in the movie, and he says angrily but with no irony, "yeah, but this is about my life, okay?" Okay, wildman, settle down, we got it, it's your life, not hers.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>Here's the first clue you're in the presence of delusionality: at no point do any of these three ask the most basic and obvious question, why would this chick be interested in Nev? This isn't an insult, this is a legit query. Why would she want him? We understand why he would want her, but for the nine months of the movie, he has no sex with any other woman. "Well we can't all be as smooth as you." I sympathize, but you're missing the point: no one else <i>who can see him</i> wants him, but she does? That doesn't require some self-reflection?<sup><a href="#footnote_12_87435" id="identifier_12_87435" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Maybe he was `saving himself` for her, rite.">xiii</a></sup></p>
<p>"He charmed her." Slow down. "Megan" probably has had some experience being charmed, right?<sup><a href="#footnote_13_87435" id="identifier_13_87435" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Not really how this works, in my experience. But then again...">xiv</a></sup> At one point, she texts that she's baking a pie, "I'll save you a piece." Guess what he does with that. No, you'll never guess.<sup><a href="#footnote_14_87435" id="identifier_14_87435" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="A teen who can bake pies ? I never saw one outside of my own, where the fuck is this ? `Michigan, famous teen baked pies` ? In fairness I suppose that's pretty close to what `Si Quaeris Peninsulam Amoenam Circumspice` comes to, and besides, isn't their state bird the blue-eyed piebaker booby ?">xv</a></sup> Comedy gold. This guy delivers the obvious like he's writing for Daniel Tosh.<sup><a href="#footnote_15_87435" id="identifier_15_87435" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I had to look that up ; though I can't say the looking up improved anything. It did provide the tidbit whereby alt-Tucker Max Greg Giraldo attempted to provide legal support for his friend Jeffrey Ross, who was indicted for his trouble fighting some guy in the audience who produced a gun, only to have to plead ignorance before the judge and have the hearing rescheduled with real lawyers in attendance.
Oh, what's the matter, too much nonsense in layers ? Ok, let's restate. Jeffrey Ross is this wanna-be Rickles, who was performing one night. At that performance, a member of the audience produced a toy gun `that looked real`. The Jeffrey Ross character attempted to wrest control of the gun from said member of the audience, and a scuffle ensued. The police arrested Jeffrey Ross, and charged him with whatever nonsense (`inciting a riot`), which then `got upgraded` to `a weapons violation` (none of these strings carry any meaning). His `friend`/acquaintance/fellow bum (they shared the floor sleeping in some older woman's basement as their sole basis of a relationship, exactly like ordinary junkies and the celebrated amir taakis / assorted `bitcoin conference` attendants of yore) Greg Giraldo offered to represent him pro bono (on the flimsy basis of being, exactly like Tucker Max, a `trained lawyer` who nevertheless `chose to be more creative` aka dropped out of school), but once confronted with the judge they discovered that they can't actually cut the mustard.
Not particularly interesting, huh ? What do you want, `stand-up comedians`, an inconsequential subculture. Exactly like the MRA, except less funny.">xvi</a></sup></p>
<p>There is an absence of self-awareness coupled with an overflow of self-absorption. "Of course me!"<sup><a href="#footnote_16_87435" id="identifier_16_87435" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I don't even understand what the fuck that's supposed to mean.">xvii</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Put this in the reverse</i>: at the end, when he discovers that he's been talking to a homely midwest mom, his friends explain that the mom is probably in love with him -- implying that <i>of course</i> a fat midwestern mom would fall for [a] dashing New York sophisticate.<sup><a href="#footnote_17_87435" id="identifier_17_87435" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="They put an apple up their butt and call it `sophironi`...">xviii</a></sup> That makes total sense. Even when they know that Megan must be an [impostor]<sup><a href="#footnote_18_87435" id="identifier_18_87435" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="No fucking idea why ESLtards keep mispelling impostor as `imposter`, but it's fucking annoying.">xix</a></sup>, <b>it never occurs to them</b> that whoever the woman actually is might take one look at Nev and say, "hold on, you can't be the guy... is this a radio bit?" </p>
<p>The problem <i>of</i> this movie -- which perfectly encapsulates the most basic problem with America -- is that it doesn't occur to the audience either. We've<sup><a href="#footnote_19_87435" id="identifier_19_87435" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Yes, well, the audience of like five people who saw this dumb thing besides Ballas might've been self-selected in some manner. Dunno, just guessing here, on the firm basis of 99% of pre-selected films I screen failing to make it past 15 minutes in.

That's what the whole `culture` reduces to, that's what it even exists for : to try and enforce this weird situation where every dork's seen as what they want to be seen. That's the only public good the whole USG apparatus even still makes the faintest attempt at even resembling to be providing anymore.">xxi</a></sup> And so any divergences from this must be quite obviously mean the other person is a jerk. </p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>An example. Let's review some basic facts about Nev because he considers them important enough to put in his movie. First, he wears a retainer. I know, I know, it's not cosmetic, it's for TMJ. Second, he spends an awful lot of time hanging out in his bed in nothing but his briefs, which only look like Spiderman Underoos because they are red. They're not Underoos. They're just red. </p>
<p>He loves the feel of a fluffy down comforter on his naked skin, that much is obvious.</p>
<p>See that pic, above, where he's sneaking up the dark driveway to peer into the garage of the mystery family that for all he knows could be cannibals?<sup><a href="#footnote_21_87435" id="identifier_21_87435" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="But this is directly speaking to the most of the problem : this ridiculous cock ornament's never been as much as punched in his entire if entirely pointless existence to date. And he should be.">xxii</a></sup> He's barefoot. When he's thinking about the malleability of identity he likes to stick his hand down his pants. In fact, what he likes on his body even more than a down comforter is his hands -- he is constantly touching, rubbing, hugging his own body. I can say with complete certainty that this guy pees sitting down and still gets the seat wet. And you know how some guys think it's sexy when a girl has a tattoo of a sun or wings on their tailbone? Well, Nev likes them so much he has one on his tailbone. I'm sure there's a funny story behind that, but I can assure you it's irrelevant.</p>
<p>So? So my reaction to all this was that Nev was utterly, genuinely, <i>hateable</i>, somewhere on the level of a Snookie or a David Hasselhoff or the Asian chick on <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>. He smiles like a Scientologist, he's monumentally passive aggressive--<i> I hated this guy</i>. Hold on -- I realize that my own natural self-loathing hovers around an unhealthy 105%, hence the rum, but the point is that Nev -- as portrayed in this movie -- <i>would never imagine that he generates this reaction in anyone.</i> He probably can imagine people not liking the movie, but why would anyone hate <i>him</i>? It's inconceivable!</p>
<p>V.</p>
<p>One final example. Angela lives with two severely retarded children. They are stepsons; this is the life she chose. Through tears, she tells Nev that when she got married, she knew she'd be making some sacrifices, but she didn't realize that in fact she'd be "resigning from her own life."<sup><a href="#footnote_22_87435" id="identifier_22_87435" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Her own life of what, supporting `Nev` ?">xxiii</a></sup></p>
<p>So, she's telling him this because she wants some affirmation, not because she wants him to fix it. How could he? But Nev doesn't hesitate to repeat all of this to the husband during his interview. "You know, Angela told me that she feels like she gave up a lot..." There are two possibilities. One is that Nev thought he was so much more intelligent and empathic and nuanced than this stupid hick -- never mind that he's been able to support a very pretty and well maintained home, and everyone in there seems happy, keeps all their needs and a decade long marriage intact -- that aside, Douchekata figures he can Dr. Phil a decade long wound in their marriage with nine seconds of HD footage. The second possibility is that he didn't even want to do <i>that</i>, he just wanted to split the wound open because he needed the shot.<sup><a href="#footnote_23_87435" id="identifier_23_87435" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Obviously, he's transparently tryna Michael Moore all over Michigan. This isn't to say `thus he's less retarded and not so insane as he appears`. Rather it's to say the original model he's trying to emulate was actually just as utterly retarded and shamefully insane, all the way, 100%. There's no absolution through the passage of time, Michael Moore isn't `famous` or `part of the history` or whatever. He, exactly like every other pantsuit pustule befouling the timeline, is naught but THIS, an offensive moron with way too much idle time creating in his malfunctioning nitbrain the delusional impression of `having options`. These don't leave behind history ; they leave behind garbage, mistakes waiting to be undone, they're just a lengthy list of nitwits and their segwits, no more.">xxiv</a></sup> I'm not sure which is worse, but I hated him just in case it was both.</p>
<p>VI.</p>
<p>Go another way: so Angela lied to them about her identity. So what? Who says they were entitled to the truth? </p>
<p>When they arrive at Megan/Angela's house and meet everyone they are on edge, what's going on here, none of this seems like Facebook? The family, especially the husband, is very friendly and cordial<sup><a href="#footnote_24_87435" id="identifier_24_87435" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Nobody seriously imagined the footage wasn't staged. Did they ?!">xxv</a></sup>, but it could have gone the other way: what kind of nuts are these? He traveled all this way to meet a girl? That makes it normal? "We want answers." You better keep your hands where I can see them. And why does Nev expect others to assume <i>he</i> is trustworthy? Because of what he wrote about himself on facebook? Haven't we established that that stuff is unreliable?<sup><a href="#footnote_25_87435" id="identifier_25_87435" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="No, actually, we're belabouring to `establish` that unreliability is the exception, and `it has consequences`, all in the forlorn hopes that it might prop imaginary `value` in a purely conventional scam. After all, who knows if the boatloads of cheap Chinese plastics would keep showing up if `the Chinese` stopped `believing` in Facebook ?!">xxvi</a></sup></p>
<p>Well, let's look at his facebook, then: he's cut out a picture of her, naked, and put it onto a picture of himself, naked. You know who does that? People who narrate their reality.<sup><a href="#footnote_26_87435" id="identifier_26_87435" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Also ">xxvii</a></sup></p>

This photo creeps me out so much I had to stop drinking. Yeah. On the drive to her house, shouldn't he have to call the Michigan police and register, or something?</p>
<p>It cannot occur to them that what they are doing is wrong because it isn't wrong -- there are no Right and Wrongs, there are only his right and wrongs. They have a need to know, they want to meet her, so it's all ok. The movie trailer plays like a horror movie, yet they don't feel any fear at all, which is weird, right?<sup><a href="#footnote_27_87435" id="identifier_27_87435" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="They're just dissociated to the superlative degree living in the zone requires.">xxviii</a></sup> You know Megan isn't Megan and you know you're wearing red underwear, shouldn't you bring backup or something?<sup><a href="#footnote_28_87435" id="identifier_28_87435" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Now you understand why there's three of the clones about.">xxix</a></sup> As bad, neither do they worry that someone might be scared of three strange men in the dark.

But hey, as long as the olive t-shirt's worn, nobody's gonna ask about the red underwear, rite ?">xxx</a></sup></p>
<p>The critics will deftly signal without spoiling that this isn't really a horror movie. Let me correct that right now: it is absolutely a horror movie. Fortunately for Angela, the psychopaths just happen to be pussies.<sup><a href="#footnote_30_87435" id="identifier_30_87435" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Not specifically `pussies`, but yes, most psychopaths are about this dysfunctional, and therefore about this harmless.">xxxi</a></sup></p>

						<p>As an amusing aside (and since you mentioned it), in those Otaku "harem" tales one may take note that... nobody ever fucks! Moreover, while the nubile women in those tales always inexplicably throw themselves at the male protagonist, he almost always is <b>uncomfortable</b> with this fact. It is almost like the authors are <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" >lampshade hanging</a> the fact that the Elliot audience knows that they could not own a woman, even in their dreams.</p>

						<p>"A teen who can bake pies ? I never saw one outside of my own, where the fuck is this ? 'Michigan, famous teen baked pies' ?"</p>
<p>Ahem, I live in Michigan, and I know a few teens who can bake pies. My wife could bake a delisch pie when I married her (she was a teen back then). It's one of the things girls learn around here, or at least some of them do.</p>
<p>And out state bird is the Robin, FYI.</p>
