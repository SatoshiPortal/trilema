		<description>Honestly he's always been peanuts ; but the &lt;a href="https://archive.is/HqOGQ"&gt;weeping October&lt;/a&gt; lulz coming on the heels of July coverage on Trilema that you quote... well.

Nobody cares, seriously. Nobody did care at any point, except for a particular class of frustrated &lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2013/fried-chicken/"&gt;nigger&lt;/a&gt; : 

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Howard C Roark&lt;/b&gt;

Jared I feel your pain.
I will miss writing for ROK. I had so many more redpill truths to drop to this generation. For me ROK was like a second home.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Apart from the little bitch bois wanking themselves really &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard to an imaginary audience from within an electrically insulated padded cell, &lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2021/the-many-things-i-couldnt-give-less-of-a-shit-about/?b=all%20it%20is&#038;e=besides#select"&gt;nobody ever gave a shit&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
