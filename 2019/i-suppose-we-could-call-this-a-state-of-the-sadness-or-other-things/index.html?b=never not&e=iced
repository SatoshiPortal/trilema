<p>Other candidate titles included "Hey there, Republic. How goes ?" "Well... you know..." (in the style and after the manner of Goosey Boy<sup><a href="#footnote_0_88600" id="identifier_0_88600" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="A gent,  you don't know him.">i</a></sup>) ; some kind of reference to the history of the ur-Republic (probably something to do with the Marian revolt / destruction, because connivance to those idiots' nonsense pretty much fucked it) ; some kind or manner of reference to previous Trilema articles (to which a few hold remarkably good claim, as it is) ; and other such inspirational materials. But in the end... what's in a title ?</p>
<p>There's a lot in coincidence, though, as well as in header images. I find it quite appropriate today's piece comes out under <em>the guise</em> of my sampling a rosebud seated on gilt chair afront a golden door an' a golden mirror (in which the concentrated face of my slave the photographer concentrates in a corner) -- yet as a factual matter I absolutely had no hand in "helping along" this fortuitous fatuousness (or, for that matter, any other). I merely sit and don't particularly mind observing, which is entirely and completely how "these things" seem to "keep happening to me", I swear. Other people mind observing, which is why it never happens to them, and that's the whole truth of the matter.</p>
<p>I wouldn't even necessarily have bothered saying anything -- there's genuinely not that much to say. Unfortunately "the flow of events" so greatly overconcentrated power in my feeble human hands, not saying anything as the non-events facially merit would in itself, for and by itself stand as a positive act, with legislative powers nobody'd even much feel like probing (for the self-strengthening reason that no discussion of stupidity was ever all that tempting to any participants), thus silently enacting silence into some sort of statutory mandate it can't <em>possibly</em> enjoy.</p>
<p>So then, let's talk about nothing -- god knows this is long standing practice on Trilema (and now you well know why).</p>
<p>Since June, a pretty month that soon followed upon the <a href=http://trilema.com/2019/antiqua-sanctorum-patrum-or-the-lordship-list-sixth-year/>Sixth Edition</a> of the yearly Lordship Lists<sup><a href="#footnote_1_88600" id="identifier_1_88600" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="For my curiosity ; name, if you will, what TMSR hath produced in that interval.

... does it have to be ? ">iv</a></sup> and... oh, pray tell, please say, do aid my aged, trembling hand. What have we lost, last night ? What was it that we lost ?</p>
<p>Talking with Stanislav always bore this troublesome relationship to talking in one's dreams : like in a dream there never was any predictable relationship between the sayings of what's said and the doings of what, apparently, was thereupon done. You'd sit down in a corner cafe, solidly credible as such, with chairs shaped like you've seen in one, many, all of them, with waiters sporting French mustachios, and vests, holding white linen folded over one arm, sett road continuing into horizon. Look where you might, indeed you were in a cafe. You'd order, say, coffee. Later on the waiter might return, bearing (as a forinstance) a three eyed half-chicken pitbull impaled on a flaming spike, and, about as often as not, would turn into fantastically tattoo'd barbarian as he broke into a run towards you for no apparent reason and flung his strange, miss-shod javelin in your general direction, supposedly, yet missing by six paces. Then he'd perhaps return, imperturbable, vest back on, linen on arm, to inquire how you enjoyed the flat white. Well ? How did you enjoy it ? Was it perhaps... confusing ?</p>
<p>Yes, it was. Quite confusing. And yet... like in a dream, <em>exactly</em> like in a dream, all proceedings perpetually proceeded on circular orbits, spinning around the same centers of gravity, regularly, predictably, their supposed precession always faint, like in a Kafkian novel, always at the very margin of perception, where mind wonders whether it's actually seeing things of its own into the eyes or whether it turns blind eyes to actual events. But for all that faintness of precession, the regularity of circumvolution never much avoided anyone's notice. It was in fact strictly impossible to watch Stanislav for more than a few weeks at a time and not notice, then soon enough predict, "now it's going to go by this, now by that"<sup><a href="#footnote_4_88600" id="identifier_4_88600" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="What's even more, inconceivably yet observably more, his own recollection of his own past always without exception found expression in the same manner.

">v</a></sup>... </p>
<p>We've lost, it pains me to say, a great many things we never had. The reasons for which we never had the things we never had might be perhaps even made to stand ennumeration ; permit me to begin : in losing the things we never had, we first lost the top part of the things we never had, followed by the middle part, and then the bottom. As to the top part of the things we never had that we nevertheless somehow lost, at first the top part of that top part was lost, and then the middle, and thereupon the bottom. And as to...</p>
<p>At this juncture I suppose you may suspect I'm not all <em>that</em> pained, foregoing declaration notwithstanding. You're right, it's true, you got me, I'm really not all that pained, what can I do ? In part I am not all that pained because I do not tend to get all that much invested in the ongoings of the world<sup><a href="#footnote_5_88600" id="identifier_5_88600" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="It's called stoicism, it's a philosophical outlook, which is to say a set of answers to the specific problems of existence, basic things like `wut do when phenomena diverge from sense` and so on. Look it up sometime.">vi</a></sup> ; in another part I am not all that pained because I don't have a particularly short memory, I'm not one of those shop girls that falls in love with the delivery boy for repeated presence and then's heartbroken six weeks thence as supply routes or their servants change -- the whole arrangement was predicated on the promise of performance, not anything else (and absolutely not my inhabituation to endless blather, be it acquired over weeks or years). It's sad, I suppose, that "trying" (however defined, usually by the alleged trier) is not exactly the same as performance ; but then by this same token one will soon find themselves sad over dreaming not being the same as believing and who knows what further nonsense.</p>
<p>Last of all (though I suppose not necessarily least of all) I'm not all that sad because the lengthy trip (and, let it be mentioned foremost, my slavegirls' exertions therein) yielded quite remarkably in terms of youthful cunt ; and with it notices and observations and a picture of the world. Leaving aside the physical, incarnate proof of perfection possible &#038; still imanent<sup><a href="#footnote_6_88600" id="identifier_6_88600" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Despondency follows from loss of faith ; and loss of faith always consists of a diminished expectation of encountering perfection, driven without exception by experience : he who long hasn't seen perfection loses his faith in its possibility, and with it any will to live -- it's how statuaries and penitentiaries are supposed to work, though on opposite ends of the human oxcart.">vii</a></sup>, as unlikely as that may on whatever basis seem, nude exemplary and therefore readily excluded in any statistical discussion : it seems to me the kids are very much unlike their parents. As I was observing privately, the <a href="http://trilema.com/2009/supunere-si-sclavie/?b=Noi%20in%20anul%202000&#038;e=copii#select">supposed great beneficiaries</a> of the Great Socialism and its grandiose fruit look yet again quite ready to stab their "loving" parents in the eyes for their blessing, as this usually works. I may be a great fish, which definitely comes with some disadvantages ; but it also permits me a faint sampling of the world as a substance, as a medium -- and it's very palpably evident to me that the medium's discontinous, abruptly discontinuous, over time. In short, I don't so much tremble over the past millenium's offspring turning out syphilitic, however systematic the assonautism turns out to be it bothers me none because times change, and my widely thin whiskers do perceive sweetness in the distance.</p>
<p>Then again it could readily be pointed out that as the attempted republic spirals ever further out of any hope to even faint relevancy... oh, you "<span style="background-color:#d3d3d3" id="select">never noticed</span>" that, huh. Try and recall : <a href=http://trilema.com/2014/the-sins-of-the-group-of-posers-behind-the-so-called-bitcoin-foundation/>at first</a> we were going to do Bitcoin development ; then we were going to build the tools for eventual Bitcoin development ; by now we'll be lucky indeed if we manage to select and educate future makers of the tools of even future-er Bitcoin development. While this endlessly cheezy pie keeps stretching, Bitcoin somehow magically manages to keep ongoing. Ever wonder how that happens ?</p>
<p>What, it has a lot of friends among the retards that would very much be powers in the world, you think ? God himself loves it, so you can mind your love of circumvection undisturbed while He does all the heavy lifting for you (but as <a href="http://trilema.com/2018/the-night-of-the-hunter/?b=the%20end%20which&#038;e=actions#select">per tradition</a> He'd still better have the common decency to  disappear suddenly in a mist when the credits are about to roll by, and <a href="http://trilema.com/2016/vacation/?b=Yet%20under%20all&#038;e=whatever#select">it's "your turn"</a> to step into the picture). The <a href=http://qntra.net/2019/09/nyse-parent-begins-trading-bitcoin-futures-introducing-new-volatility/>most recent attempt</a> at breaking my words<sup><a href="#footnote_7_88600" id="identifier_7_88600" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="For amusement's sake, find where I said 10k is a permanent floor, shortly prior to that `surprise offensive`.

Ah, remember back in the day, before I shaved my dog's ass and taught it to walk backwards, back in the day when that Krugman clueless poser was `respectable economcian` ?">ix</a></sup> by the entire might &#038; power of "the civilised world" or however the fuck the arrayed muppets call themselves this season <a href="http://trilema.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/derp.png">was again defeated in the field</a> ; as the twopence republic <a href=http://ossasepia.com/2016/03/28/when-the-messenger-shoots-back/?b=although%20he%20quite%20knows&#038;e=away#select>well explained</a> its desires last time anyone talked to it about anything of import -- it wasn't included in the flow of events to any degree this time, as all the uncounted times hence. How many of them were there ? Who knows... who, among ye who wouldn't have known this one but for my pointing it out, knows ? What is it that you know, what <em>can</em> be known on a servant's weekly discretionary shilling ?</p>
<p>Think, if you will, that this makes an uninterrupted <a href=http://trilema.com/2013/in-which-noobs-learn-lessons-and-pay-for-the-privilege/>eighty months</a> of my word&#038;deed driving this space, and with it the entire world ; then tell me again why I should give shit one over some rando shithead or other's <a href="http://trilema.com/2020/forum-logs-for-07-sep-2019/#2554295">inability to leave the safety of mommy's basement</a>. Really, you think I should care ? Well... I don't.</p>
<p>It could readily be pointed out that as the attempted republic spirals ever further out of any hope to even faint relevancy one will necessarily turn to his private sphere, and to the future. This is true ; but this theoretical truth is not what drives the empyrical observations above -- much like the man climbing into the bus he was waiting for will always be <em>also</em> climbing into "the first bus that showed up" over some interval of observation. Rather, the future set of human resources are markedly better than the current set most likely because of reversion to the mean -- you'd be (and in fact, you are) hard pressed to find worse shit than that which composes the current crop of shamblers about.</p>
<p>It's what it is, what do you want <em>me</em> to do about it ?! Please don't tell me I should pay teh seventeeb bitcoin again, or somesuch nonsense ; at least that much could be learned from the succession of hateful mean-ness an' toxic facts also formerly known as "history". </p>

						<p>And since I am here... shout-out to alfie... alfie, my man ...are you going to keep serving this Napolelol that wants to ditch your dumb ass for the longest time now, or what? Used and dumped like some retarded whore. It would be sad to see this comedy show end like this. </p>
<p>Hey Mirko, lissen. Its not going to be a peanut gallery once you stop serving peanuts to peasants. The stupidity on this pantsuit never ceases to amaze. Trumped only by pretense I suppose.</p>
<p>And before you ask 'who are you and what have you done', because for you that is your only way out:</p>
<p>I am the stray dog that fucked your mother.</p>

						<p>Mircea Popescu: the 'three eyed half-chicken pitbull impaled on a flaming spike, and, about as often as not, would turn into fantastically tattoo'd barbarian...' aspect is actually what I enjoyed the most about working with MP.</p>
<p>Of Course: who the fuck are you? I don't know anyone named "Of Course". As far as serving goes, I'ma serve until released from my oath. (Do they have concept of oath in your culture, stray dog?)</p>

						<p>@<b>Of course</b> A boy was born one Autumn ; and then Winter came and the cold winds howled outside, but the boy was coddled in a little cot, among Mother's discarded rags, and, warmed by same Mother's dripping teats cared not for winds or outsides.</p>
<p>Then Spring came ; and by and by the boy waddled out of his coddlings, and crawled about the well trod earth making the floor of the thatched hut he first knew as a thing in this world, and soon enough over the threshold, into the sunshine above, atop the grass for the first time. </p>
<p>As it happened right then the Lord of the place, the one man there who therefore owned the hut, not particularly but indistinctly, the man who owned all the huts there by owning the grass upon which they stood as far as the eye could see, and with it consequently and as a matter of necessity also the serfs therein pullulating, and the product of their pululation (mostly, huts) as well as the women of the land, and the product of their pullulation (mostly, girls and boys), happened to pass by. </p>
<p>The Lord was riding a great warhorse, and thereby the boy for the first time in his life saw a horse, and as the horse happened to be a mare, by logical process of similarization the boy thought this must be an even better Mother! So large! Luscious! Delicious!</p>
<p>As soon as he could, he found his way into the stables, following the scent, the scent he remembered oh so well ; and once inside he crawled to the closest pair of legs, fortuitously just in time to be met by a great brown offering. The boy was fortunate indeed, at first to crawl out of the indistinct hut just as the Lord was passing, making <em>that</em> his first vision of the world ; but then, sustainedly, to walk under a horse for the first time just as the horse shat, imagine!</p>
<p>The little boy was miffed by the experience, and concluded that the Lords' Mothers are really not so good : look ye, how instead of dripping warm milk from their smallish tits they drop instead big great horsepies from their grand ole' arses! That Lord, he must be a fool, crawling under horses like <a href=http://trilema.com/2011/pentru-ca-zmeul-de-internet-e-prea-zmeu/ >a little clueless boy with a mouth full of shit</a> on the earthen floor he'll be trudging for the rest of his days.</p>
<p>No ? And in due time, the boy walked in the woods, nominally either taking there something for the Lord, or else taking from there something for the Lord, but otherwise (and except for that unmentionable part we shouldn't mention) an entirely independent, self-possessed, protestant mind about <del>the town</del> the woods, genius of creation valuing all things by his divine gift of intelligence and all that. So the boy told the trees about the truth he's discovered of mothers and horse's asses, and the trees nodded approvingly. </p>
<p>Because after all... why wouldn't they.</p>
