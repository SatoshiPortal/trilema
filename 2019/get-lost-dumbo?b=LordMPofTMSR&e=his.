<blockquote><p>miss-s-dom 29F<sup><a href="#footnote_1_82630" id="identifier_1_82630" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="My scripts never messaged a female aged over 25 at the time of discovery, for the very simple reason that they can't. This is just how machines work, aite ?
Nevertheless, responses keep flowing in from all sorts of girls aged even into the 30s! 
Part of it can be explained by the natural process of aging, specifically that some of them are so fucking stupid, the cutoff runs away from under them before they can get the well greased gearbox to spin enough ticks to actually get back to me. The part that can thus be explained is up to maybe 27 or so, but certainly not any older -- meaning that the rest simply lied about their age at a previous moment in time.
Which is something girls dumb fat biosacs of no particular value do all the time, of course. What they don't do, however, is not get back to me. The bitches may protest all they want -- but in cold, actual, machine-verified reality they do drink every last dreg off that inbox, they do read it all, they're just so fucking addicted to undeserved attention they simply can't help themselves.
So, in practical terms : you can rest assured that whatever female recipient did read whatever you deign to send her way, irrespective what claims she makes about it. She read it, and if she's saying otherwise she's simply lying, that's all.
Stop believing women.">ii</a></sup> Domme<br />

<p>That'll have to do -- not because <a href=http://trilema.com/2013/the-story-of-pointless-and-witless/>there's any end to them</a>, but because there's an end to my patience. But, in the hope that I've entertained and educated, <em>a bon entendeur, salut!</em></p>

This is just how machines work, aite ?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, responses keep flowing in from all sorts of girls aged even into the 30s! </p>
<p>Part of it can be explained by the natural process of aging, specifically that some of them are so fucking stupid, the cutoff runs away from under them before they can get the well greased gearbox to spin enough ticks to actually get back to me. The part that can thus be explained is up to maybe 27 or so, but certainly not any older -- meaning that the rest simply lied about their age at a previous moment in time.</p>
<p>Which is something <del>girls</del> dumb fat biosacs of no particular value do all the time, of course. What they don't do, however, is not get back to me. <a href=http://trilema.com/2018/the-bitch-doth-protest-two-woof/>The bitches may protest</a> all they want -- but in cold, actual, machine-verified reality they <em>do</em> drink every last dreg off that inbox, they do read it all, they're just so fucking addicted to <a href=http://trilema.com/2016/stfu-attention-whore-culture/>undeserved attention</a> they simply can't help themselves.</p>

						<p>I read though your accounts posts and you seem rather condescending also you seem to think that having a kink/fetish is the same as being apart if a BDSM community which is a huge red flag. Joe shmoe may have a kink or fetish. He will have little understanding of how to do it safely as he only has things like porn and random shit he finds online to help him understand it. This makes him likely an unsafe kink partner. But a safer kink partner would be someone involved in the community. Who has learned from other safe people. Gone to events and seen others do kink safely. Gone to seminars and took lessions form people who have all but mastered the craft(I dont say mastered as their is always something to learn) these people although not surely safe have a far more likelyhood of being safe then Joe shmoe. Also in your drama queens writting, you said you dont wanna hear what woman think the rules should be... Does that mean you dont beleive in negotiation? If so then you are not fit to be a master(assuming you mean the role not just the word). As to be a master, for someone to fully submit to you, there must be a great amount of trust. The slave must trust that you know their needs. They must trust that if it ever goes to far they can make you stop. And everyone has their own rules because everyone has their own limits (medically and non-medically). I could of misunderstood your work but by reading multiple of your posts I found the same condescending "higher then thee" type writting. Also multiple insults on woman's appearance as if that has any relevence to the conversation as if you got to negotiation you whete obviously attracted to them.</p>
