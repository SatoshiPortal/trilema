                        <div class="entry">
<p>I re-read the whole set<sup><a href="#footnote_0_82978" id="identifier_0_82978" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="24th of April, Year 7 : A new Lordship List ? ; 9th of February, Year 8 : The Lordship list, third year. ; 31 March, Year 9 : The Lordship list, fourth year. ; 28 February, Year 10 : The `Rivers of Blood` article, or -- The Lordship list, fifth year.">i</a></sup> in preparation for this item, I'd say it's quite informative, and besides -- how things have changed!</p>
<p>As passed through the many years (which in our world count above decades, almost on par with whole heathen centuries), the list now stands as </p>
<ul>
<li>Her Ladyship <strong>diana_coman</strong>, Marquess Eulora,</li>
<li>Her Ladyship <strong>hanbot</strong>, the Lady Falconeer,</li>
<li>His Lordship <strong>trinque</strong>, the Master of the Rolls,</li>
<li>His Lordship <strong>bingoboingo</strong>, Lord Goebbels,</li>
<li>His Lordship <strong>mod6</strong>, the Lord High Steward,</li>
<li>His Worship <strong>danielpbarron</strong>, the learned Trishop,</li>
<li>His Lordship <strong>mircea_popescu</strong>,</li>
<li>His Lordship <strong>asciilifeform</strong>, the Lord Admiral,</li>
<li>His Lordship <strong>ben_vulpes</strong>, the Lord of the Well,</li>
<li>His Lordship <strong>phf</strong>, the Lord Chancellor.</li>
<li>His Lordship <strong>lobbes</strong>, the Lord of the Auction House.</li>
<li>His Lordship <strong>spyked</strong>, the Lord Crypto-Alchemist.</li>
<li>His Lordship <strong>ave1</strong>, the Lord Logiciel.</li>
</ul>
<p>That'd be thirteen, which I suppose makes the obscure titular reference somewhat more justifiable, if marginally so. In any case, as to proposals : </p>
<ol>
<li>I don't believe <b>danielpbarron</b> can continue on the list. It's a matter of belief, you see -- the fellow fails ye olde fiefdom criterion by not actually doing anything all day long, and the court criterion by having enwebbed himself in such a mess of irrational (not to mention counterproductive) saecular commitments that I can't imagine a sort of dispute in which his word would carry the sort of weight befitting a lord of the Most Serene Republic. Can you name a topic, situation or circumstance on or in which you'd seek DPB's perspective ?</li>
<p></p>
<li>I suspect both the Republic and <b>ben_vulpes</b> himself would be best served by his being removed into <b>trinque</b>'s house -- as <a href="http://trilema.com/forum-logs-for-02-mar-2016#2045687">Marcus Porcius</a> once observed, "I'd much prefer the citizens should wonder why I was no more than a knight rather than wonder why I was so much as a lord". I am bringing this up mostly seeking comment from the very parties involved, for myself I have no intention to push the matter, at least not this time around.</li>
<p></p>
<li>In a similar vein <b>mod6</b> is going through some dubious times, but if nobody strongly objects I suppose it'd cost little indeed to merely look at the matter again next year.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Contrary to last year's <a href="http://trilema.com/2018/the-rivers-of-blood-article-or-the-lordship-list-fifth-year/#selection-251.283-255.12">sarcastic sendoff</a>, the new lords worked out quite well! If it works, don't break it -- so how about we expand our rolls to include <b>bvt</b><sup><a href="#footnote_1_82978" id="identifier_1_82978" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="blog, log, wot.">ii</a></sup>! Maybe he could be the Lord Verschlimmbessert ?</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Mocky</strong> would have made a stellar addition, in my considered opinion ; but as he's hit a bit of the same tarpit beleaguering the other lords<sup><a href="#footnote_2_82978" id="identifier_2_82978" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="People like esthlos presumably disappeared by sinking in there too ; it's not clear to me what became of billymg, but I'm guessing a touch of ye olde reading.">iii</a></sup>, it may be wise to postpone elevation for a year ? I quite readily see both ends of this coin, however, so let's say I'm simply going to throw my support behind whichever path the fellow himself prefers : if he wants he should be raised this April, I'll support it, and if he'd rather be raised next April, I'll support him then.</li>
<p></p>
<li>I will not support <strong>nicoleci</strong>'s accesion this year, she is yet <em>crue</em>. Maybe next year.</li>
<p>
</ol>
<p>The lordship is cordially invited to affirm, reject, discuss, reconstruct or otherwise interact with the (conveniently numbered for convenience by the department of redundancy department) items, or even add some of its own! The comment box below warmly, eagerly and batedly awaits this, and nothing else!</p>

						<p>I am also in favour of adding <b>bvt</b>. </p>
<p>It is not clear to me if <b>Mocky</b> actually desires lordship, but I would support him if he did based off of his solid <a href="http://mocky.org/" >work to date</a></p>
<p><b>danielpbarron</b> has stated his non-objection to the matter; there's nothing meaningful I could add.</p>
<p>No objections here to <b>mod6</b> remaining a lord in 2019. While I am a lord, I consider myself a junior one, especially to mod6. Seeing as I received time to sort out my various tech/cultural debts, I see no reason mod6 should not also. He has done foundational work for the Republic over the years, and even up to now it is obvious the guy cares a great deal re: his work.</p>
<p>The activity of both <b>nicoleci</b> and <b>ben_vulpes</b> appear to primarily be in other houses, therefore I have not the knowledge to meaningfully comment one way or the other. I'll leave that to those who do have such knowledge.</p>

						<p>@<b>Mocky</b> Excellent news!</p>
<p>@<b>lobbes</b> Re the bimbo half of</p>
<blockquote><p>The activity of both nicoleci and ben_vulpes appear to primarily be in other houses</p></blockquote>
<p>chick's done what, a few woman-weeks' worth of summaries (that alf didn't like) and a few woman-months' worth of by-hand typesetting of old bmp pdf's. All of this happened in #trilema ; none of it is coding work, of course -- but then again I believe it's well understood that a Republic built on code work only will not survive its would-be builders.</p>

						<p>1. I thought Daniel had an interest/experience in irons for Eulora and the game itself but his own blog clearly points to the loss of this interest in favour of missionary work with a bit of cooking on the side and nothing else otherwise. </p>
<p>2. I'm happy to support whatever version trinque and ben_vulpes consider most appropriate here at the moment.</p>
<p>3. I support any option that Mod6 himself prefers here at the moment. From my point of view, he is still active and engaged, if struggling at the moment - hopefully he finds his way out of the whatever tar pit he got in, as his previous record is excellent.</p>
<p>4. I fully support Lord Verschlimmbessert! </p>
<p>5. Great to hear that Mocky is ready this year.</p>
<p>6. While I actually even wish there were more non-coding people in l1, I think nicoleci still needs some time to find her fiefdom more clearly. I don't think that the number of hours-work done/exposed in #trilema is a meaningful criteria for lordship in itself.</p>

						<p>> in favour of missionary work</p>
<p>"Missionary work" in the limited sense of trying to spread the word about what, in his own terminology, would be "a false church". It ain't like God himself's gonna come down riding a <em>hirzob</em> an' fix computers for us ; nor is he gonna be all that impressed when he comes about to check on work done, either (at least, if my own experience with being god is anything to go by -- which, supposedly, is how this works).</p>
<p>This "we're all faithful, but nothing works" is for the birds. Literally. Apud Francisc of Asisi (popularily also called Sisoe).</p>

<p>In my experience it's usually "we're all faithful because nothing works."</p>

						<p>I support the proposed moves including the ones offering options to the current and prospective lords. bvt's work is making his case. The tarpit is a serious problem and extraction from there is a problem those currently afflicted are in the best position to estimate their extraction from. </p>
<p>Last year ben_vulpes put himself out there to help get Pizarro going. This year I have a lot of gratitude that he stepped up last year. As lord or knight I recognize ben_vulpes as carrying noble arms.</p>
<p>As to nicoleci, no one is better positioned to evaluate her potential for elevation to the peerage than her master.</p>
<p>The danielpbarron situation is a shame. With an enviable degree of freedom compared to the mired lords, he disengaged. I'd still weigh his opinion, but the space I'd weigh it in is smaller than the one I'd give anyone else presently on the list.</p>
<p>Congratulations to last year's inductions.</p>

						<p>I back DPB's removal, bearing him no ill will. There doesn't seem to be a lot going on there these days.</p>
<p>Ben Vulpes has long had my trust and respect; I would not be with the Republic without him. I'm happy to support his decision.</p>
<p>I've given mod6 a few whallops lately, but they've been in the spirit of rousing a friend that's had a bit too much to drink. If he's still in it, why not give him some time.</p>
<p>bvt has my support! He seems an intelligent and productive chap.</p>
<p>Mocky as well. He had the courage to drop everything and adventure in Qatar. Surely there's a bit more of that in him yet.</p>

						<p>With havin so much content and articles do you ever run into any problems of plagorism or copyright infringement? My website has a lot of exclusive content I've either created myself or outsourced but it seems a lot of it is popping it up all over the internet without my permission. Do you know any methods to help protect against content from being stolen? I'd certainly appreciate it.</p>

						<p>For one thing, Trilema is written in a very particular, deeply personal style. This has the disadvantage that its writing can't be outsourced, but with it comes the advantage that its writing can't be outsourced. To quote from the <a href=http://trilema.com/copyright-notice/ >Copyright Notice</a> on the right : </p>
<blockquote><p>If you find an idea you like, it may seem to you expedient to simply run with it - rewrite it "in your own words" and pretend yourself smarter than you actually are, for the benefit of whatever limited audience. While the better part of a decade in publishing has provided me with countless examples of this bit of naivite being readily deployed, and while I readily understand the vanity involved, nevertheless let me point out to you that it's actually to your detriment to attempt to separate yourself from the source of things you like. That idea of mine lives in a context, and for good reasons. If you liked it you probably would also like her sisters, already extant or in the future to be devised. If you liked it but you hate its sisters the problem is more likely to rest with you - I put a lot of thought into my articles. In short : whenever you behave like the stupid Romanian you miss out on the better parts of life.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that I'm likely a lot more widely read than you - especially if your planned defense to an infringement action is <a href=http://trilema.com/2014/hashfast-or-why-the-fiat-legal-system-doesnt-actually-exist-and-doesnt-actually-matter/ >abject poverty</a> - and that I have a distinctive, unique and readily recognized style. This means that your appropriation is quite likely to be discovered, and quite likely for it to result in your ridicule - notwithstanding what your five classmates or three coworkers may claim to think in your own comment section. As the saying goes in business, it's much better to be a small part of a great thing than the largest part of a vanishingly tiny thing.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you take a moment and think about things : what is the difference between the man who sits down to write "your" "content" because you told him to and will pay him a fixed salary, and the man that sits down to write "infringing" "content" because he's doing it on his own ? If your content can be produced by another, then these two others <em>are doing the exact same thing</em>! Which is after all precisely your complaint -- but you're allied with the wrong part. Why are you hanging out with the morons who have to be managed and paid salaries, instead of the march lords who don't ? If you have the problem you describe, you have it because your systematic worldview is broken, and it's broken because you broke yourself, deliberately if perhaps incomprehendingly. </p>
<p>For another thing, Trilema does have more content than anything else, including here the entire English cannon besides the various <a href=http://trilema.com/2013/wikipedia-the-special-olympics-for-the-mentally-retarded/ >tardpedias</a> or <a href= >mass medias</a>. It's not merely that it's more widely read than the New York Times, it's that it's <em>more influential</em> than that sad <a href=http://trilema.com/2018/heres-what-polyamory-is-not/#selection-387.154-389.22 >Vorwarts</a> of the ESL pantsuit, meaning that while whatever Gawker prides itself with "23 monthly million pageviews" the year before its inconsequential demise, Trilema prides itself with thirty to forty such million, but nor mere "pageloads". Instead, actual people, actually reading, ten thousand actual articles! </p>
<p>Consider the difference between a Christos Ballas, or an Erik Naggum on one side and whatever unmentionably nameless and anodyne "media celebrity" on the other! The former stopped writing, and yet their writing <em>lives</em>, and today as forever their writing <em>is continued</em>. The day some youtube/instagram/huffpo/whatever <a href=http://btcbase.org/log/2019-03-28#1905876 >Leah</a> finally croaks is the day nobody notices -- there's at least five thousand replacements ready to go, identical clones of the same shitpile, and "her" "content" was outsourced anyway in the first place! You can, evidently, build a very expensive server farm which serves the "general public" ten minute clips of cats playing with yarns. The fact that "one" such clip "had 23 million views" means exactly nothing -- those were the viewing of nothing in particular by no-one in particular, by this reasoning any traffic jam is a supermarket parking lot (a confusion primitive tribes such as inhabit say Costa Rica readily make). Meanwhile something like <a href=http://trilema.com/2014/interacting-with-fiat-institutions-a-guide/ >Interacting with fiat institutions, a guide</a> reaching fifty million views earlier this year did more damage to the United States' Government pretense to sovereignity than most anything most any other pretend-sovereign of the fiat type yet managed! These are very different things ; yes <a href=http://trilema.com/2016/asscience/ >buying into</a> the <a href=http://btcbase.org/log/2017-12-22#1756992 >system of impotence</a> then leads downstream to impotence. Of course it does! You can't go around with <a href=http://trilema.com/2018/messy/#selection-43.21-43.46 >that little bit</a> between your legs asking men "how come they get erections", unless your role in the grand play of human society is comedic relief.</p>
<p>Look at this comment, and consider what it'd cost you to have it reproduced by "outsourcing" the work. We don't mean merely the chaining of, at the present count, 1`074 words. We mean the whole structure -- there's links in it, relating to extant material, and not merely links, but specific textual references! One time I want to draw your attention to #selection-387.154-389.22 while some other time #selection-43.21-43.46 is the point of interest. Dozens upon dozens and hundreds upon hundreds of portions, parts, items, individual ideas or particular expressions that aren't merely there! They live, and that is the fundamental difference. Were Trilema as small as you ever wish it to be, an ephemeride living its day of life in the shadow of the largest Egyptian pyramid, yet what would be the deepest difference between Trilema and that pyramid ? Not density, nor size, nor duration in time nor anything like that, but the one fundamental fact, that while the little insect <em>lives</em>, however shortly, however precariously, the pyramid does not, and never has. And never will.</p>
<p>Trilema has a point, you see. I don't have the problem of <a href=http://trilema.com/2010/i-am-very-smart/ >random idiots</a> substituting themselves for me because random idiots don't have a point ; and the people who do have a point are generally interested in representing their point, rather than mine, and generally prefer to represent it to me, rather than to nobody. It all makes perfect sense, if you think about it.</p>
