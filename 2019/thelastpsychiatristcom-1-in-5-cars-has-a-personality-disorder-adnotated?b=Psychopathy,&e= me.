<blockquote><p>Almost one in five young American adults has a personality disorder that interferes with everyday life, and even more abuse alcohol or drugs, researchers reported Monday in the most extensive study of its kind.</p></blockquote>
<p>And the article then becomes a list of every cliche and conflation possible.<sup><a href="#footnote_0_84951" id="identifier_0_84951" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="For instance, I'm willing to bet `abuses alcohol` means something asymptotically close to `uses alcohol`.
My idea of withering irony is to observe that the current implementation of the old woman lobby, pointlessly if spuriously pretending to `Academia`, is strictly retracing the exact same intellectual horizons of the previous edition of the old woman lobby, back then pointlessly if spuriously pretending to `Church`! They're gonna put an end to that devil drink, dontcha know! A one woman mission for the personal salvation of every guy with something better to do than give a shit about stupid old cunts!
Incidentally : are you aware just how much of the pantsuit verbiage, narrative and mythology surrounding `the plight of the Negro` before Obama gave them 40 acres and a mule is simply copied off old Marxist texts penned originally in German and Russian principally between 1910s to 1930, and discussing originally... the plight of the African Negro, at the hands of the Imperial powers (mostly, the weird Belgian personal domain over Congo thing) ? `Translated`, incomprehendingly, from Russian, and translated, geographically, into their rural sphere of interest. Sound familiar ?
The last time old women in pantsuits contributed something to the history of ideas the year was counted in triple digits! Fucking remember that.">i</a></sup> Though the article is about personality disorders, they then lament how common "mental problems" in college are, and the need for further treatment. One psychiatrist found the "widespread lack of treatment worrisome... it should alert not only ''students and parents, but also deans and people who run college mental health services about the need to extend access to treatment.''</p>
<p>Here is awesomeness:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Dr. Sharon Hirsch, a University of Chicago psychiatrist not involved in the study, praised it for raising awareness about the problem and the high numbers of affected people who don't get help. Imagine if more than 75 percent of diabetic college students didn't get treatment, Hirsch said. ''Just think about what would be happening on our college campuses.''
</p></blockquote>
<p>Are we still talking about personality disorders? </p>
<p>It has the obligatory references to the Virginia Tech and other shootings. I seem to remember everyone's insistence that those were not due to personality disorders?</p>
<p>Well, I can see that the current crop of <a href=http://trilema.com/thelastpsychiatristcom-the-dumbest-generation-is-only>adults, age 35-60</a>, I so admire for leading our country into moral, economic, and intellectual greatness, have accurately identified one of the most pressing problems today. Nothing worse than an alcohol abusing, personality disordered college kid. Exactly what Allan Bloom would have thought, or, more accurately, exactly what they think Allan Bloom would have thought, as they can't be bothered to find out.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>The NYT is a blog pretending to be a newspaper. It's for adults, or people who want to pretend they're adults<sup><a href="#footnote_1_84951" id="identifier_1_84951" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Which is very much not the same thing at all...">ii</a></sup>, who remember as kids that reading the <i>Times</i> meant something that they'd now like to apply to themselves. Now it's Bandwagon of the Month reporting: anyone see any global warming articles recently? Bush is suppressing them, I guess.<sup><a href="#footnote_2_84951" id="identifier_2_84951" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Speaking of which, the lulz unyieldingly continue : Finnish And Japanese Researchers Find Incredible Lack Of Evidence For `Man Made Climate Change`">iii</a></sup></p>
<p>So the problems it describes must always be of the form: "the other guys who are not you are bad." That's widely perceived as liberal bias, though that's not accurate. It's "not you" bias. The online readership is 37 years old, print 42-- this is the demographic that says, 'College kids are weak and pampered, if I could only go back to college and do it all over again..." [Do] What? Get a physics degree, or date sorority girls? Or both?<sup><a href="#footnote_3_84951" id="identifier_3_84951" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Except the NY Times `readership` (which is to say, people who pretend to be reading the New York Times, as nobody actually reads the sad thing) never fucked sorority girls, a point made all the more self-evident by the intrinsic contradiction in his formulation : `date` sorority girls ? When the fuck did this happen, mixer ~= orgy and in any case nobody sexually active dated in fucking college, back when sororities and dating were things, which is to say cca 1980.">iv</a></sup></p>
<p>III. </p>
<p>The article's conflation of "personality disorders" with every other kind of mental illness is a hint that an agenda is lurking. That a popular press article would even bring them up-- previously, everything was bipolar or schizophrenia and <i>not</i> personality disorders (think Virginia Tech)-- means that an agenda is lurking.</p>
<p>That the <i>actual</i> <a href="http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/65/12/1429">Archives of General Psychiatry </a>study, from which this "1 in 5 Young Adults Has A Personlaity Disorder" news article is based, the one--</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Results</b> Almost half of college-aged individuals had a psychiatric disorder in the past year. <b>The overall rate of psychiatric disorders was not different between college-attending individuals and their non-college-attending peers.</b> The unadjusted risk of alcohol use disorders was significantly greater for college students than for their non-college-attending peers (odds ratio=1.25) <b>although not after adjusting</b> for background sociodemographic characteristics. College students were significantly less likely (unadjusted and adjusted) to have a diagnosis of drug use disorder or nicotine dependence... than their non-college-attending peers. Bipolar disorder was less common in individuals attending college. College students were significantly less likely to receive past-year treatment for alcohol or drug use disorders than their non-college-attending peers.</p></blockquote>
<p>--in which the finding of personality disorder <i>does not even merit a mention</i> in the abstract, so insignificant was that finding to the study itself--</p>
<p>all that means an agenda lurking. You're not being given information, you're being given a worldview. Eat it.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>But let's take it at face value-- 1 in 5 kids 18-21 have a personality disorder.</p>
<p>What's surprising about that is how <i>low</i> it is, considering that many of these "disorders" are normal developmental stages. When your 17 year old stays out past midnight, doesn't call, and then has the nerve to get mad at you for being mad at him -- that may be a discipline problem, but it's not a personality disorder. I get that you're angry, I'm with you, but the solution isn't a psychiatrist. The solution is not to consider that the problem is pathological, but that it is the <i>default</i> behavior that you must help them change.<sup><a href="#footnote_4_84951" id="identifier_4_84951" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="But isn't that what the psychiatrist does ?">v</a></sup></p>
<p>Given the move towards infantilizing kids, that personality "disorders" would linger a little past adolescence -- into the sheltered Quad of Prolonged Adolescence U -- is not surprising. What matters is not the availability of treatment, but whether these "disorders" can be expected to resolve themselves naturally as they age, find relationships, jobs, a stable identity.<sup><a href="#footnote_5_84951" id="identifier_5_84951" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="How is one of these marginal kids going to `find jobs` ? There are no more jobs. All that's left are activities, which very much aren't the same thing as jobs : the cage for him and the bed for her.
So no, none of these `disorders` are going to resolve ; pl0x #nowhine">vi</a></sup> Of course they can. Or, more to the point: the bias should be that things are normal, not pathological.</p>
<p>V. </p>
<p>But let's take a philosophical approach. What does having a personality disorder even mean? Can an inanimate object have a personality? Apparently, yes.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12110-008-9047-z">Human Nature</a>: 40 people looked at pictures of cars and had to rate them against 19 traits (gender, maturity, submissiveness, etc.) The subjects consistently identified the same traits among the cars. </p>
<blockquote><p>"The study confirmed with some rigor what many people have already felt -- that cars seem to have consistent personality traits associated with them"</p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously, cars don't have personalities, they are inanimate. We attribute personalities to them. No one would dispute this. You might say the cars are designed to elicit certain feelings towards them -- fine -- but the cars themselves do not possess character attributes, they only possess appearances.</p>
<p>Yet in the study, the different subjects -- these are not all genetic clones, they've had different lives and experiences -- still rated the cars as having the same attributes. What does it mean, really mean, when everyone thinks a car is aggressive, or submissive, when it <i>isn't</i>? Think about that, long and hard. </p>
<p>We have  internal personality constructs which are completely invalid. That they are <i>hard wired</i> into us, that so many other things are hard wired<sup><a href="#footnote_6_84951" id="identifier_6_84951" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="`Hard wired` my foot. Just because the vast majority of English speakers alive today imagine anyone asked the woman anything doesn't mean asking women is `hard wired` ; particularly large conventions, fashions and mores do not become anything more by their expansion just like particularly large organisms do not become immortal through size.">vii</a></sup> into us, doesn't make them less invalid. An optical illusion is still an <i>illusion</i>. These are cars. Metal.<sup><a href="#footnote_7_84951" id="identifier_7_84951" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Metal my foot.">viii</a></sup> Your mind is tricking you, on purpose. What you saw was <i>wrong.</i></p>
<p>When you look into the abyss, the abyss looks also into you.</p>
<p>VI.</p>
<p>Surely I'm not saying personality disorders don't exist? Or that people don't have personalities? If you were the Last Man On Earth, you'd still have a personality, right? </p>
<p>Even when you're alone, there's still "another person" present -- that internal dialogue you have with yourself, as another person. You're never truly alone, even if sometimes you don't like the company. And I haven't even brought up one's interaction with God, as epistemiologically unfashionable as that is to talk about nowadays.</p>
<p>All that aside, personality is the interplay between your physical/biological/innate/whatever traits and your life as you experience it (books and movies count); the interaction between you and Others. As such, it can be drastically altered, both by you and by other people, by time and environment, on purpose and not on purpose.</p>
<p>VII. </p>
<p>The consistency in the ratings of personality was, the researchers found, related to the <i>appearance</i> of the car; how far apart the eye/headlights were, etc. In other words, the cars were judged by how they <i>look.</i> "What's inside" the car, how it <i>behaved</i>, wasn't even relevant.</p>
<p>If this is true, how hard will it be for a person to overcome the prejudice based on appearance? How much will they have to overcompensate to make up for it? How strongly will you believe the person is a smart/mature/aggressive/etc, no matter what he <i>actually</i> does? Keep in mind these subjects know what a car is, they know that the appearance of a car does not reflect how it performs<sup><a href="#footnote_8_84951" id="identifier_8_84951" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I am not so sure these `knowns` are in fact known. These same people could not explain how a refrigerator works, I find it altogether dubious they have a technological, rather than magical, take on vehicular ontology.
Seems rather the case that the same mental processes that gave Diana chastity and Venus sluttery may well give a Toyota bravery, in the same way for the same reasons. `It's there`, right ?">ix</a></sup>, they know cars don't have personalities, and <i>still</i> they give it certain attributes. How different will that be in people?</p>
<p>How easy will it be to resist simply conforming to the way you are viewed? How hard will it be for one person to say NO to the world, and self-identify? To resist the negative <i>and the positive</i> perceptions of others, in favor of who he decides he wants to be? </p>
<p>Pretty darn near impossible, I should think.<sup><a href="#footnote_9_84951" id="identifier_9_84951" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I perceive no difficulty ; nor do I recall a time when I did perceive this supposed difficulty.
Psychopathy, rite ?">x</a></sup></p>
<p>VIII.</p>
<p>Back to the NYT. I'm sure I'll be disputed, but hear me out: we're entering the age of Keynesian Psychiatry, and the NYT can't contain its ejaculate.</p>
<p>It's an era where "free will" and the normal checks and balances of society and superego are considered ineffective.<sup><a href="#footnote_10_84951" id="identifier_10_84951" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="It's not that they're `considered` ineffective. They are, factually, necessarily and quite readily provably ineffectual.">xi</a></sup> No one can be expected to resist the id<sup><a href="#footnote_11_84951" id="identifier_11_84951" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This is not the matter. [Almost] nobody can be expected to make sense of their surroundings and general context in anything like an actionable timeframe anymore. Complexity explosion driven by cognitive developments coupled with utility dilution (through machine-driven efficiency increases) has resulted in a 90%+ supernumerary species -- there's literally no reason for most people to even be here.">xii</a></sup>, and we need our parents to help keep us in control, or bail us out, send us money, when we need it.<sup><a href="#footnote_12_84951" id="identifier_12_84951" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Rather, `we` in the sense of not-me need `your parents` (though the `girlfriend` readily qualifies) to underwrite the very expensive attempt of pretending to keep up with me.
In subsidiary : yes, the female tendency towards magic thinking is very much not driven by the female's own laziness/stupidity/anything else ; but entirely driven by the batshit insane burdens her owner is putting on her -- through the unlikely avenue of not loading her properly.">xiii</a></sup></p>
<p>We have massive bailouts, where the solution to 30 years of prior deficit spending is -- sit down-- <i>more </i>deficit spending; when the solution to overconsumption and undersaving is -- even more consumption and less saving. Similarly, 30 years of maladaptive behaviors will be treated with -- different maladaptive behaviors.</p>
<p>It's not profits and growth, it's "fiscal stimulus" and "infrastructure development" -- in psychiatry this means less focus on treatment, less focus on "remission," and increased spending on detection, prevention, education -- <i>you're already sick, you just don't know it.</i> This dovetails nicely with the (temporary) death of Big Pharma, who won't be generating any new treatments any time soon. And if it's not obvious why early detection and education is bad: you don't get to decide what kind of detection or what kind of education. Psychiatry does.<sup><a href="#footnote_13_84951" id="identifier_13_84951" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="And by Psychiatry he means `psychiatry`.">xiv</a></sup></p>
<p> So too will there be increased "services" for the "mentally ill"-- redefined as anyone at all who wants the benefits<sup><a href="#footnote_14_84951" id="identifier_14_84951" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="No, actually, the `benefits` won't last. Already the `benefit` of being part of the great Inca's empire are chiefly poor-er nutrition than the world average. While the victims may defend their victimization furiously, nevertheless nobody actually benefits from participating in any USG-run scheme today, nor has for many, many years.">xv</a></sup> -- even if these services weaken society in the long run. Both are Ponzi schemes built to fix prior, failing Ponzi schemes. They'll fail, just in time for our kids to get drafted.</p>
<p>Just as you see a move towards more government regulation and control, so will you see psychiatry mirror this. Laws will be written and revised, focusing less on punishment while simultaneously emphasizing surveillance. For example: "taking cocaine is a disease, it shouldn't be punished, it should be treated. So let's have mandatory drug testing for everyone 14 and older, you know, for early intervention."</p>
<p>Psychiatry as an arm of social policy means we have accepted society's new mantra: please save me from myself.<sup><a href="#footnote_15_84951" id="identifier_15_84951" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Rather, it means society's accepted the new reality : there's literally nothing to do with, for, or about the vast majority of extant walkers.
