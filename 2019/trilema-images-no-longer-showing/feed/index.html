		<description>I'm not sure what your point is, if anything. Leaving aside how &lt;a href=http://trilema.com/2019/how-plugrushcom-got-itself-banned-or-heres-what-business-is-not/ &gt;I wouldn't deal with AWS anyway&lt;/a&gt;, Bezos' cost structure is actually pretty byzantine : they want 9 cents per GB for 9`999 GB out of 10 TB (nfi why Bezos thinks there's 10`000 G in 10 T, but whatever) plus 8.5 cents per GB for the next 30 TB, plus 7 cents per TB from there on. So on this basis my cost serving the two-odd daily TB I had been serving, ie about 80/month, would come to 9999 * 0.09 + 30000 * 0.085 + 40000 * 0.07 = 6`249.91 USD (do the math). On top of this I expect they'd want to tack various other costs (there's for instance a mysterious "acceleration" fee of 4 cents / GB, not to mention whatever other nonsense they might come up with, "running the instance" what have you) not to mention lulzy ridiculousness like fiat pretender "&lt;a href=http://trilema.com/2014/the-death-of-taxes/ &gt;taxes&lt;/a&gt;" and, conceivably, a "&lt;a href=http://btcbase.org/log/2019-07-28#1925240 &gt;code of conduct&lt;/a&gt;" too, why not.

Are you off your fucking rocker, man ?! A hundred dollars still buys me &lt;a href=http://trilema.com/2019/derpy-sluttyev-or-how-shall-i-call-this/#comment-130359 &gt;a coupla Ukrainian coeds&lt;/a&gt; for the whole night, there's not 62 nights in a month, what the fuck are we talking about here!</description>

		<description>For your kind of volume AWS charges 7 cents each GB. You could have cheaper at 5 cents if you used over 150 TB monthly, that is 5 per day not 1-2.</description>

		<description>Here's an update: 

As described &lt;a href=http://btcbase.org/log/2019-01-26#1890071 &gt;in the logs&lt;/a&gt;, immediately upon activation most of the idiots involved in leeching trilema BW went into the typical mode of idiocy : retry &#038; try again!!!

This resulted in a lot of pageloads for this particular article, propelling it into the top of most read articles for January (notwithstanding that, obviously enough, nobody fucking read it).

The daily call for it dropped, however. Taking the Fri the 25th for 100%, it went 196% on Sat (the first full day), 186% Sun, 173% Mon, 167% Tue, 87% Wed, 13% Thurs and it looks well like 1% or so so far today. 

&lt;b&gt;So -- problem solved!&lt;/b&gt; On one hand, there's a significant drop in BW usage that precludes any need for me to either buy more or curtail such greats as &lt;a href=http://trilema.com/2019/la-paz-adica-pacea/ &gt;the recent lion article&lt;/a&gt; ; and there is absolutely and entirely no loss on the other hand -- &lt;a href=http://trilema.com/2018/heres-what-changed/#selection-43.2-43.42 &gt;these fucktards&lt;/a&gt; weren't anyone's &lt;em&gt;readers&lt;/em&gt; anyway. Shooting them in the head does no detriment to anyone but &lt;a href=http://trilema.com/2017/fake-news-are-just-one-tail-of-the-failed-female-state/ &gt;the femstate&lt;/a&gt;. 

Needless to say, I heartily (and for reasons! explained reasons!) recommend the above described procedure to anyone and everyone ; and fuck the fucking femstate with &lt;a href=http://btcbase.org/log/2019-02-01#1891333 &gt;a burning iron pike&lt;/a&gt; already.</description>
