<p>Dear Phf,</p>
<p>I hear -- through intermediaries, because that's the right and proper way to talk to people, Hannah must hold me down<sup><a href="#footnote_0_86627" id="identifier_0_86627" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I don't read other people's logs, deliberately and systematically, not merely as a most convenient cover for my own laziness &#038; self-centeredness, but so that I don't end up walnuting the world. (The walnut is a bitter tree, such that `not even grass can grow under it`.) It has nothing to do with my dislking the respective lords, and everything to do with my liking them, you see.">i</a></sup> and read outloud what you said in Stan's castle, we have no other manner of connecting nor did I ever realise just how much I missed junior high before -- that you gave some doctors in Moscow something to really earn their bread with ; which they did. Good for them! There's nothing more satisfying to the well equipped and well rested professional than a spot of serious work to be done, and if doctors are not always well rested nor universally well equipped... well what can you do, them's the breaks. I'm sure they're as grateful for your showing up in their ER as indeed can be. </p>
<p>Honestly, meeting you in Minsk was quite pleasant, if shockingly sterile. I enjoyed the frivolous conversation, there's a certain elegance involved in hurling through the air by the hundred verst to thereby discuss the weather upon landing, a certain old world <em>savoir faire</em> that I rather appreciated. It's true that in this I was complicit, as I myself didn't drive the discussion any harder than that ; I must confess the abusiveness therein involved altogether escaped me at the time, but then again the truth is I'm not that finely attuned to these things. I must say now that in retrospect I obviously see why you wouldn't have mentioned anything about it then -- after all, the girls were brandishing machine guns, and you had every reason to fear for your life at my hands (as the later unfolding of events clearly prove). </p>
<p>In the same line, I absolutely see the wisdom of not saying word one about your airplane-or-train dilemma. As it happens (though you had no way to know, it was evidently reasonable to assume) I did have the ability to ship you off to Moscow with a driver of your choice in either a car or a van (or even I suppose a hearse might also have been arranged for, in a pinch -- wouldn't that have made an impression on Moscow hospital staff, young man from Minsk coming out of a hearse!) -- that would then have poisoned you en route, stabbed you repeatedly with old discarded syringes found about roadside restrooms as per my express orders, as well as thrown you off a cliff. </p>
<p>It is, as you well know, very wise to keep your cards as closely glued to your chest as possible, in this evil world we live in, set as it is upon our painful if not necessarily immediate demise, which is why you did well to supress any mention whatsoever of your doubts about the quality of healthcare you were providing yourself, and forestall any questions as to possibly better alternatives. God knows that if you were to ask anyone in Minsk, it'd have absolutely had to not be me, a raving lunatic every bit as dangerously insane and incoherently deranged as my reputation deservedly indicates. And besides, it's simply not within the realm of the conceivable that any self-respecting lord of the republic would travel with large groups, or pre-arranged support systems on the ground, or keep lists of doctors like he keeps lists of nightclubs, restaurants and other dens of perdition, or have spare drivers at the ready or anything in the vein of slack at all. Because you don't, and that's therefore how it goes for me, also ; and besides, the food at some downtown restaurant happened to be at best dubious, which indeed is enough to prove all the foregoing by itself.</p>
<p>It's not in any case possible that a grouping of two million souls upon the earth presents some variety, such that it's possible to encounter outliers of any kind, as proven by the fact that when hanbot died a most avoidable death<sup><a href="#footnote_1_86627" id="identifier_1_86627" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Inexplicably she's popped back into living sometime hence, though perhaps it's really just a reconstruction of smoke &#038; mirrors.">ii</a></sup> in my realm a year ago it was the absolute first thing we tried that also proved to be sufficient and the correct choice, and no widely cast net of physicians, managers &#038;al were at all either needed or employed to find the one good hospital in the two million strong orc aglomeration. So successful was in fact this strategy of not talking to anyone back then, that none of us were heard from again ever since!</p>
<p>Let me not forget to extend my compliments to that misfortunate woman, whom you stubbornly refuse to as much as <em>give a name to</em>, stuck as she finds herself with a dork who's way too intelligent for her to get around him but way too fucking stupid to make anything of it. The one thing she evokes is a fly caught in a spider web. A fly caught a while ago, which the spider's silked over and maybe will eat later. Who knows. Any day now, you'll open your eyes and her life will begin, let's sing along now, "The rain falls down on last year's man... An hour has gone by and he has not moved his hand... <span style="background-color:#d3d3d3" id="select">Yet everything will happen if he only gives the word</span>..." </p>
<p>Amen.</p>
<p>Unless, of course, you fucking die first. Unless you manage to die first, leaving her behind to wonder. Maybe if she said like this and so ? Maybe she should have asked thus and following ? Maybe when you grunted vaguely you really meant three psalms and a dozen scripture verses, if only she were smart enough to see the obvious in there ? Maybe the real meaning of the ferris wheel is death, in the manic-psychotic nightmare-dream her daylight's somehow become around you ? </p>
<p>She's got an inspiration, did she. I can rather imagine how that "inspiration" went, aged her half a decade, two or three more inspirations like that she's gonna grow white hairs. "Oh, it's the disease in me" -- no, it very well fucking isn't. I've got a girl in the other room who's cried herself to sleep quietly, her hide tanned in three different layers of bruises, none of which from yesterday, whom I've never treated as cruelly as this insane nonsense.</p>
<p>The Romanian expression goes "<em>unde-i multa minte-i si prostie destula</em>", and it fits you like a fucking glove. In this life I've enjoyed the bitterness of burying fifteen year olds, who as it happens weren't born as intelligent as you were, which is not something anyone either asked or didn't ask for ; but by the time they were done they had clawed themselves into manhood, on that limited power and in that limited time, such as it was and such as they had, so at least nobody had to bury any children in their name. It's <em>something</em>.</p>
<p>Do you realise you were nearly buried a twelve year old 30something, like fucking Naggum exactly ? Do you ? Does it do nothing in your fucking head, what the fuck are you here for ?! Nevermind me, "oh hurr durr, Minsk doctors are no good, MP is a meanie poopyhead, they deserve each other" -- where the fuck were <em>you</em> during all this ? You were being abusived, don't fucking tell me, you were ghosting about, dissociated from your own body to the degree you'll just surprisingly get sepsis one day. "Oh look what I can do!" Who the fuck is supposed to go around in that thing, a squirrel with lots of levers, for all you're concerned, "<a href=http://trilema.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/dog-instead.jpg>hi this is not phf</a>" shall be the hole of the law ?</p>
<p>I guess we shall all wait quietly forever now. Realia altogether will patiently sit around to "see how things work out" henceforth, because some dork named Phillipe invented the ultimate time-control device : <a href=http://trilema.com/2015/stop-all-the-clocks-again/>all the clocks stopped</a> and the whole world frozen over in sheer terror at the manifest possibility of... perhaps doing the wrong thing ? Maybe saying the wrong thing ? </p>
<p>Here's a nickel's worth of clues : just because it paralyzes the insides doesn't mean it also works on the outside! Wonder of wonders, what the fuck were you doing at the age of five ? Being really smart &#038; praiseworthy, learning how to read, or whatever other shit older year olds are supposed to do, I suppose ? All the while mising out on the basics, but who the hell needs those, right, soviet elite education of parts.</p>
<p>I've said the wrong thing more times than you can count. I'm not about to stop, either. Кто ты по жизни?</p>

						<p>I always thought your typical avoidance of sarcasm was because you didn't like it --not because yours was so sharply slicing it does even, invisible cuts of the meat. The flavor has nowhere to hide!</p>
<p>I do hope phf rests and recovers, and reflects with a mind towards staying alive and staying around, and not staying mum. No sarcasm.</p>

						<p>@Stanislav It seems the moral is that it is important to plan for the contingencies which come from Lords being made of man rather than iron. A Republican's girl(s) gotta know who to talk to when Lord doesn't wake up to spec.</p>

						<p>@<b>Stanislav Datskovskiy</b> I suppose that's a possible reduction, why not. The "<a href="http://trilema.com/2019/trilema-goes-dark/#comment-130590" >must be iron man" mythology</a>'s really a Matryoshka doll, peel all the layers you want, still won't touch the actual core of it.</p>
<p>@<b>BingoBoingo</b> Consider that for all the people who complained along the lines of Pete Dushenski's historical "oh, pantsuits dun wanna shed the pantsuit, o noes, wanna try one on yourself instead ??!?!?" argument, exactly 0 had a castle fulla owned &#038; paid for pantsuits to point to, "look here, brave sirs Joe, Moe and Sclomo do great work but they just can't depantsuit". </p>
<p>It's always <em>purely theoretical</em> existences that don't exist, I'm supposed to finally "come to my senses" and start giving shit one about fucking ghosts now. All these imaginary nobodies that "could have had" etcetera. </p>
<p>Fuck that dumb shit. Back in junior high it was "I'll believe she's your girlfriend when you show me her cunt", but <em>apparently</em> not only did we go to different schools, we also only want to return to <em>certain parts</em> of the twelve year old worldview.</p>
<p>Whatevers.</p>

						<p>I was never particularly smart or praiseworthy, I spent my childhood playing with other kids and barely not failing out of school. I'm not afraid to say or do the wrong thing though that's mostly due to the forum, I've done it plenty in the forum, and to you personally, and I've survived. I really believe that being succinct is better than verbose and my intent has been to keep a high snr in the forum, rather than to keep to myself. </p>
<p>I think this whole thing about me being poor at communication came about as I started failing at my republican responsibilities. I would sometimes disappear for weeks in the past and then come back and it never was a problem as long as I was delivering. First time I announced my vacation though three years ago bot was brought down immediately after, so I decided against doing it in the future. I'd like to point out that after this recent public phf disappearance bot was brought down again after more than a year of automatic operation.</p>
<p>I'm sure our meeting has just confirmed the introversive phf trope, but by then I already started a fever and was in pain. I truly regret that we didn't have better conversations, because otherwise it was quite pleasant even if as you said "sterile". I have no doubt that you could've recommended a good hospital. I did some prep work before coming to Minsk myself, and found friends of friends through my meat wot. My interactions with Minsk medical system was questionable, first a misdiagnosis, then it took long time to get any kind of test results, then finally a diagnosis. By the time I made a decision to leave I had a referral for a hospital in Minsk but also some cyproflaxicin to cary me over. I didn't want to stay in Minsk, that would've been several weeks of hospital time and then I still would've had to travel. In Moscow I have a large meat wot which was immediately available of people who helped with food and visits and took some load off girl (how's this worse than "pet" or "miss vulpes"?). I just didn't like Minsk.</p>
<p>No junior high was intended, I wasn't trying to pass hearsay to you. I resurfaced in ascii's castle to communicate two points, that I was still alive and that I've decided to step down. This was not an attempt to accuse Mircea of all the sins while nobody's looking. I did some thinking, and was voicing some of my thoughts to Diana, because I wanted them voiced while I had the resolve. Our usual way of communicating was not available, which is the forum, but I wanted other lords to know what I was thinking. I believe it's a better to step down explicitly than to let things continue the way they've been going or slowly drift away. I value the role of the lord of the republic, I just don't want the fear of losing it to be used to put pressure on me, which is what happened in the bolix conversation. I ended up giving ascii files that has everything that he needs to continue his research, but despite the urgency nothing came of it.</p>
<p>I was hoping to address all this in forum, but am I even welcome there anymore?</p>

						<p>@phf:</p>
<p>&gt; By the time I made a decision to leave I had a referral for a hospital in Minsk but also some cyproflaxicin to cary me over</p>
<p>Interestingly, I got "lucky" and caught the infamous "swine flu" in '09, just when USA medical folks were giving out cyproflaxicin like candy, "prophylactically against comorbid pneumonia". And ended up with the "rare" side of random attacks of ligament pain for years (interestingly also, eventually went away. half decade later.) Back side of the medal, but at least not sepsis.</p>
<p>&gt;  (how's this worse than "pet" or "miss vulpes"?)</p>
<p>I suspect there'll always be a set of such "non-playing characters". And not only women; e.g. recall my visit to Ro attourney recced by MP (and I entirely believe he's a serious pro) who could not be persuaded, in any language I knew, to use GPG...</p>
<p>&gt; I ended up giving ascii files that has everything that he needs to continue his research, but despite the urgency nothing came of it</p>
<p>Not only appreciated, but in fact drafted design for test bed device in which can sit down "Ivory" cpu and run program. But not had time to manufacture, yet.</p>
<p>&gt; I was hoping to address all this in forum, but am I even welcome there anymore?</p>
<p>Can't picture why Phf would *not* be welcome in the forum.<br />
FTR is entirely welcome in mine.</p>

						<p>@<b>phf</b> Looky here, </p>
<p>> so I decided against doing it in the future</p>
<p>You might've decided, but you ~never said as much~. Snr or no SnR, the line saying "motherfucker, the day I say I take a vacation the bot goes down ; I'm just not going to say anything next time, see how this works out" is plenty at home.</p>
<p>We sat face to face over cakes or whatever, and the words "oh, republic sucks, you're abusive, this is bs" etcetera never came out of you. </p>
<p>> this whole thing about me being poor at communication came about as I started failing at my republican responsibilities</p>
<p>Yes, obviously, as per <a href=http://trilema.com/2013/youre-gonna-have-to-learn-that-variety-speak/?b=that%20everyone&#038;e=wants#select >long standing republican doctrine</a> (and standing as such since long before this particular republic was even declared) the lord can get away with bloody murder. Of course he can. But this doesn't mean it's not murder, or not bloody.</p>
<p>Nobody <em>wants</em> to do more work than they have to. Nobody. Diana doesn't <em>want</em> to untangle six layers of nonensical calls across three libraries. She does because she has to, and if she didn't have to would have done someting else. Stan doesn't <em>want</em> to make a logger Tuesday on the basis of having found out he now has to Friday. He does, because he has to, but it's not what he wanted to do today. Doctors in Moscow don't <em>want</em> to dig you back out of the hole, they weren't sitting around the watercooler that day going among themselves "you know what'd be cool ? if some half-dead kid rolled into here right about now" just as you rolled in. You think my absolute favourite activity in this double bed surrounded by mirrors in Warsaw is discussing your communication style ? I do it because I have to. I do it when you leave me no other fucking choice but to do it.</p>
<p>So yes, very fucking much for as long as you appear maybe-not-utterly-fucked-in-the-head people won't say anything. Because they don't particularly want to, this isn't the gossip circle, "oh, have you heard, MP's penis is all crinkly and Phf was barely not failing out of school". Who the fuck even cares, and why would they, it's just not how adult life goes! Only once shit starts hitting the fan and getting in people's drinks do they look up from the other stuff they were hacking on (don't tell me, there's only three hackers here and you're one of them) and start inquiries into why the fuck is there shit in their drink now. That's how it goes.</p>
<p>> bot was brought down again after more than a year of automatic operation.</p>
<p>I don't know, specifically, why and wherefore. It's possible nefariousness is afoot, god knows <a href=http://trilema.com/2013/boys-and-girls-i-got-news-were-being-probed/ >it wouldn't be the first time</a> ; it's possible you're just being paranoid, I have no fucking idea. Worth looking into, for sure ; not worth making it a life's work.</p>
<p>> I already started a fever and was in pain</p>
<p>Dude, nobody's out to get you, or to paint you any particular color, or anything in that vein. I don't care, I don't depend in anything I do on you sucking, or being introverted, or anything else to do with you. I can write the next poem/porn/technical/babbling/whatever Trilema piece whether you're the Star Trek Q or the biblical antichrist, it makes entirely no difference, I can be just as stupid or smart or dumb or loud or whatever else I am whichever way you go. </p>
<p>Yes, given the choice I'd prefer being friends with the Q from Star Trek than not ; but also given the choice I won't be friends with some dork who <em>pretends</em> to be whatever the hell. That's the limit of my investment -- faintly positive association with achievement and strongly negative association with fakerism.</p>
<p>You don't want to be introverted, don't be introverted. You want to be a paragon of communicational acumen, please, by all means, be all that. I'm not about to stop you ; nor do you properly speaking need me to notice. Do the things you like, the things you think are important, do them well, I guarantee you nobody is ever going to say "oh, that phf is such a great communicator &#038; life of the party, too bad he was in pain and had a fever in 2019". Who the fuck even cares or for that matter remembers this sort of shit as a <em>counterexample</em> ? Nobody ever ; it's only remember when it's <em>not</em> a counterexample.</p>
<p>> how's this worse than "pet" or "miss vulpes"?</p>
<p>It's not.</p>
<p>>  I just didn't like Minsk.</p>
<p>Me either ; it fucking sucks. It still doesn't mean you had to take a train out of it!</p>
<p>Not that it's the end of the world that you did, man. It's your ass, I don't either envy or suffer for your own decisions. I suppose the argument could be brought that "it nearly was the end of the world", and had it indeed been the end of the world then making Moscow in six hours starting stat as opposed to making Moscow in six hours wait time + ten hours travel time in a train would perhaps made the difference ; but nobody besides you has standing to bring that, so from over here it's all roses. Good for you that you found yourself a solution that you could live with. Literally. </p>
<p>If the train ran out of track in Orsha, what then ?  </p>
<p>>  I ended up giving ascii files that has everything that he needs to continue his research, but despite the urgency nothing came of it.</p>
<p>Yes, well. You may not want to hear this, but it was principally the terrible job you did communicating yourself that got you in that unsavory pickle, also.</p>
<p>Not that I'm defending the insane style of "must have toy right now maybe I need to play with it later" or anything.</p>
<p>> I was hoping to address all this in forum, but am I even welcome there anymore?</p>
<p>Well, currently it doesn't exist ; but as it re-embodies (looks set to do so ahead of original schedule) yes, exactly like I told <a href=http://trilema.com/2019/trilema-goes-dark/#comment-130541 >that other guy</a> : Sure, as long as you stick around to learn from it. It's just how our shit works.</p>
<p>@<b>Stanislav Datskovskiy</b></p>
<p>> I suspect there'll always be a set of such "non-playing characters".</p>
<p>Yes, but the question is whether there are any actual player characters in supporting roles, should the main character be hit by a bus.</p>

						<p>Looks like you wiped a deep sleeper.</p>
<p>Timing gives it away, if you look at timelines it becomes all clear: 1.joins and does some work a man-week or two(four years ago) then just keeps reading the feeds. This is typical sleeper behaviour, he wants to read the feeds of the group he is infilitrating but he wants to read them as an insider! This is important enough wasting a week by doing something for them in exchange of getting a year of what he wants is sustainable.</p>
<p>2.http://logs.nosuchlabs.com/log/trilema/2019-07-05#1921583 brings it to a head. He knows he can't pass muster, he also knows he can't not go. You were talking about meetings 19th/20th, what did he do for two weeks? Coming up with WSOD stories about it, "too stupid for somebody to make this up" that somehow(props MP!) still didn't get him off the hook credibly? Looks like it took some prodding <a href="http://logs.nosuchlabs.com/log/trilema/2019-07-16#1922828">http://logs.nosuchlabs.com/log/trilema/2019-07-16#1922828</a></p>
<p>3.Lets take <a href="http://logs.nosuchlabs.com/log/trilema/2019-07-20#1923976">http://logs.nosuchlabs.com/log/trilema/2019-07-20#1923976</a> as T0, 18:00 July 20th in Minsk(UTC+03:00). T+17h <a href="http://logs.nosuchlabs.com/log/trilema/2019-07-21#1924110">http://logs.nosuchlabs.com/log/trilema/2019-07-21#1924110</a> people start talking about it. He...waits. </p>
<p>4.T+34h, you sum up the logger situation <a href="http://logs.nosuchlabs.com/log/trilema/2019-07-22#1924180">http://logs.nosuchlabs.com/log/trilema/2019-07-22#1924180</a></p>
<p>5.T+87h, you make it direct <a href="http://logs.nosuchlabs.com/log/trilema/2019-07-24#1924509">http://logs.nosuchlabs.com/log/trilema/2019-07-24#1924509</a></p>
<p>6.T+192h, you put an ambiguous lid on it <a href="http://logs.nosuchlabs.com/log/trilema/2019-07-28#1925342">http://logs.nosuchlabs.com/log/trilema/2019-07-28#1925342</a> "weird case", you reference same problem from May 2018 so you let him know you are on the scent. T+199h, you draw distinction between naggum <a href="http://logs.nosuchlabs.com/log/trilema/2019-07-29#1925415">http://logs.nosuchlabs.com/log/trilema/2019-07-29#1925415</a> Now things become interesting!</p>
<p>7.T+285h, he turns his logger off. 86 hours enough for "nobody could accuse me" plausible-deniable story of sickness.</p>
<p>8.T+292h, you turn off #trilema. T+298h <a href="http://trilema.com/2019/trilema-goes-dark/">http://trilema.com/2019/trilema-goes-dark/</a> appears.</p>
<p>9.T+305h, phf surfaces but in #asciilifeform talking out of all mouth sides about the unfairness of it all, his victimhood and general unfairness of oppression. He of course claims its all spur of the moment, but if you bother to read it clearly engineered for later. He may not be as good as you are at these things, but he is clearly trying a lot harder than you are.</p>
<p>10.T+380h you <a href="http://trilema.com/2019/trilema-goes-dark/#comment-130587">http://trilema.com/2019/trilema-goes-dark/#comment-130587</a> agree with him then T+396h <a href="http://trilema.com/2019/a-nickels-worth-of-clues/">http://trilema.com/2019/a-nickels-worth-of-clues/</a> appears.</p>
<p>11.T+417h he replies <a href="http://trilema.com/2019/a-nickels-worth-of-clues/#comment-130684">http://trilema.com/2019/a-nickels-worth-of-clues/#comment-130684</a> exactly same as #9, carefully crafted nonreply. Engages none of the points, "apologizes" deniably for unrelatedness, reframing hooks everywhere, all the good stuff.</p>
<p>12.T+418h you reply, just as craftily mothballing all his reframe attempts, gracefully restating the important points without falling into any of the pitfalls he's expecting, not insisting, not betraying any weakness, just smooth conqueror's lance driving the multitudes. He can't find anything to come back with for ffity two hours! then you decide he's had enough time to squirm,</p>
<p>13.T+470h it's the kiss-off <a href="http://trilema.com/2019/trilema-goes-dark/#comment-130823">http://trilema.com/2019/trilema-goes-dark/#comment-130823</a></p>
<p>14.T+482h hail mary attempt at preserving the utility of that sad one week of work he actually put in. </p>
<p>Oh and of course let us not forget 15.T+483h <a href="http://blog.lobbesblog.com/2019/08/fog-of-war/comment-page-1/#comment-50">http://blog.lobbesblog.com/2019/08/fog-of-war/comment-page-1/#comment-50</a> replacement agent already hard at work "helping" the vulnerable outer layers as he perceives them.</p>
<p>The sleeper of today is like the panhandler of old, he looks for comedy gold nuggets in a river he hates. He doesn't hate the river for anything to do with the river, he just hates it because it doesn't fit into his world, that's all, he wants gold to trade with some other guys he has homoerotic fantasies about, to get whores and whiskey, and to play poker. What the fuck is this river anyway. Fishes, what are those, majestic views, fir trees, wut?!</p>
<p>Getting there takes work, staying relevant to the flow takes work. Some rivers carry a lot of gold, which is easily fished out, but in the insane logic of the soulless this also makes it less worth. You know how this goes and TLP explains it too. Some other rivers are hard to get to, takes more work. The life mission of the sleeper is putting in as little upfront work as possible and then getting as much panhandling out of that work as possible. Now clear your mind of all your bias, what you think people can or can't do, should or should not do, would or would not do. Forget what is sensible or to be expected in any kind of packaging. None of it matters. Sleepers are fucked in the head exactly like you say, it is a very selected group, you can not use extensions of mainstream heuristics on them.</p>
<p>On the basis of what he actually did, can you say phf was ever anything but a sleeper? Look at the delta-Ts, look at how it all fits in, think about what everything is. "Signal to nose ratio" right? Not <a href="http://trilema.com/2013/chi-non-piscia-in-compagnia/">http://trilema.com/2013/chi-non-piscia-in-compagnia/</a> right. Let me guess, he had health issues and motivation issues, of course he did.</p>
<p>tl;dr <a href="http://trilema.com/2013/valiant-prince-mp-explores-the-mother-of-all-echo-chambers-a-saga-of-our-times/">http://trilema.com/2013/valiant-prince-mp-explores-the-mother-of-all-echo-chambers-a-saga-of-our-times/</a> continued itself, even if you never cared enough to notice. I do not know if they claimed any lolz this time, but like last time you got all the lolz there were to get. Well done.</p>
<p>How does it feel to be literally the smartest person alive?</p>

						<p>I dunno, d00d. Seems to me whenever indolent stupidity's sufficient to explain failful behaviour, no further explanation need be sought.</p>
<p>This isn't to say that I believe or disbelieve whether any indolent idiot is "part" of some kind of group of indolent idiots, howsoever "organized". Whether half a dozen kiddies gather together in something they call somehow, "tree fort" or otherwise, and tell each other they're this-that-or-the-other has no bearing. If you walk one day into your garden and discover some raccoons/your boy and his preteen friends/<a href=http://trilema.com/2013/margaritas-ante-porcos-as-it-were/ >whoever the fuck</a> wrote on some paper that "this is really the tree fort"... it dun do nothing about the title deed to the place, see ? You still own, it and all, them included. However they represent or <a href=http://trilema.com/2011/cred-ca-pe-alocuri-se-exagereaza/?b=Daca&#038;e=or%20fi#select >misrepresent</a> their objective status in the world, they're still your fucking things.  </p>
<p>This is to say that indolent idiots <em>absolutely</em> lack the capacity for participating in groups. Irrespective of what they might be telling themselves or others, or what is found written anywhere, the membership of #kanzure, #something-awful, #the-united-states-government or any and all groups of indolent idiots stands as the individual members <em>only</em>. Thus then follows : from <a href=http://trilema.com/2016/i-am-firmly-against-universal-franchise/ >the theory</a> comes <a href=http://trilema.com/2014/georg-ritter-von-flondor-and-what-his-unhappy-life-can-teach-us/ >the practice</a>, and that's all there is to it. There's no "the collective of the residential unit #5 on 11, Police Street A, NY, NY" just as there's no "the collective of junior high class 7a in Retard Warehouse F, Skoptsy, Ohio" just as there's no "United States" or "<a href=http://trilema.com/2016/kids-born-after-the-world-went-to-shit-arent-progressive-theyre-just-lazy/ >the liberals</a>" or "<a href=http://trilema.com/2016/a-quick-word-on-feminism/ >the feminists</a>" or etcetera. Individual confused morons, one and all, but any grouping on them you perceive is <em>entirely your invention</em>, you brought it <a href=http://trilema.com/2015/peripateticists-kinda-except-girls-not-boys-bare-cunt-instead-of-toga-and-walking-around-the-house-not-the-garden-but-otherwise-exactly-the-same/?b=All%20of%20t&#038;e=furry#select >from home</a>, like "groupings" of the clouds in the sky. It's really just water.</p>
<p>PS. Amusing link you got there though. Watching the far outskirts of Trilema is mildly interesting, like watching contrails is mildly interesting. So some pantsuit found on reddit that some menalone picked up some bits from here third hand and then restated them as best they could, retarded as they are ? And therefore dramas ? Awww. Aren't the morons cute, how they go about things as if they were persons and everything. And <em>then</em> they hunted mammooths ? *wonkaface*</p>

						<p>Let me insist.</p>
<p>Chapter III (somewhere deep in a painful, prolapsed, suffering colon) </p>
<p>Is it forming into focus yet? You thought <a href="http://trilema.com/2018/the-catfishing-story/" >lowly_slut started with a guy on fet saying he's the guy in </a><a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/01/openbsd/">http://www.wired.com/2014/01/openbsd/</a> was what, weird? A coincidence?</p>
<p>It's not coincidence. You have a large following. In a world where there is absolutely nothing to do. There is nothing that means anything anymore. Restless kids will dedicate themselves to scoring points in imaginary encounters with the greatest thing out there. It's unavoidable.</p>

						<p>But then they wouldn't be in control.</p>
<p>These kids are the kids that can not trust you, can not trust anyone enough to let them be in control. And can you blame them? To get this broken they had to go through family, and friends and school, and TV and everything else.</p>
<p>These kids were hurt so much and so systematically, anything organised is suspect. Anything still standing is probably the enemy. Imagine running into a dog some idiot kicked every day since it was a puppy. "Insane" dog, right. "What dog would do such things", right. That dog would. Feral humanity returned through widespread societal &amp; cultural failure.</p>

<p>FWIW I met the fella in person, and did not end up with the portrait you painted. Instead met the same cultured, honest, and quite capable man that appears in the "naive" reading of historic log.</p>
<p>I suppose I must also then be "sleeper" ? Please write my "biography" next, would greatly enjoy reading.</p>

						<p>@<b>Stanislav Datskovskiy</b> Since you bring it up, it occurs to me I actually want to clarify this : did the honest man you met in person bring up the </p>
<blockquote><p>[1] I believe it's a better to step down explicitly than to let things continue the way they've been going or slowly drift away. [2]I value the role of the lord of the republic, I just don't want the fear of losing it to be used to put pressure on me, which is what happened in the bolix conversation. [3] I ended up giving ascii files that has everything that he needs to continue his research, but despite the urgency nothing came of it.</p></blockquote>
<p>contention, with a view that A. you two resolve it, such that B. he needn't pester me with it later ?</p>
<p>Be<b>cause</b>, transparently : if you two broke bread but 3 above never was brought up, then as a factual matter neither his claim 2 nor his claim 1 are true -- the first because if indeed he valued the role he'd show more respect to you than to <em>outright lie</em>, which is what omission's in this context ; the second because if indeed he'd rather be explicit than stupid he'd rather be explicit than stupid -- and therefore neither your evaluation as to his honesty holds water, nor is he either capable or cultured.</p>
<p>These words make specific representations about the world. If you call a man honest, this <em>necessarily</em> means that two kinds of situations will never happen in the future : the positive discussed in #8, and the negative discussed here. A honest man <b>MUST NEVER</b> "<a href=http://trilema.com/2009/rezistenta-prin-cultura/ >resist through culture</a>" by not mentioning nudity to the nude emperor, and <b>MUST ALWAYS</b> have cause for saying things, <b>MAY NEVER</b> say things for purposes. These flow as per the spec of honesty, there are no ifs or buts available. If you call a man capable this <em>necessarily</em> means he does not find himself in "spirit, willing -- flesh weak" type of situations, "oh, I <em>wanted to</em> say it but my lips just wouldn't move". If you call a man cultured this <em>necessarily</em> means he has the intellectual wherewithal to both see what has to be done, know it has to be done, and know how it's to be done and know how to do it remarkably well, in elegant form able to withstand the passage of time. Such as seen here. This comment, I would propose, is an example of a cultured and capable man being honest.</p>
<p>I don't, myself, think phf is either honest, cultured or capable. Not that I bother to evaluate whatever boyhood-romantic notions of <em><a href=http://trilema.com/2012/despre-cum-silviu-gherman-ruleaza-si-alte-cacaturi-irelevante-pe-care-le-tot-adaug-eu-in-articole-cit-si-mai-ales-in-titluri-ca-sa-nu-se-poata-citi-nimic-de-catre-nimeni/?b=ala%20cu&#038;e=feroce#select >interlopiei de cartier</a></em> come from the <em><a href=http://www.jeg.ro/dupa-monitoru-gri-stam-noi-anonimitatea/ >lumea antrenantă a drogurilor (legale!) din judeţul Sălaj, a plătirii poliţelor, a primejdiilor de la tot pasul, şi promisiunilor deşarte</a></em> Anon's proposing ; this because I'm not fucking fourteen years old anymore (like just about everyone else <em>is</em>, incidentally -- from Christos Ballas to the Symbolics people to <a href=http://trilema.com/2018/surprised-by-joy-the-shape-of-my-early-life-adnotated/ >CS Lewis</a> to whoever the fuck else -- Trilema's so full of fucktarded 14yo boys it fucking pains the mind). But these are separate concerns. </p>
<p>(And yes, he is capable-of-{some enumerated list}. This is not what capable means.)</p>

						<p>@Mircea Popescu / 27:</p>
<p>Actually that meeting was precisely when I started to hammer on his head re the docs. Took almost 2y of hammer!</p>
<p>Which reminds me, probably ought to take the time to prep these for publication, "before I myself get sepsis"(tm)(r) -- currently I have NFI when will actually get the chance to carry out the experiment enabled by the docs (PCB where "ivory" mounted, powered/clocked and manipulable from PC.) Presently I have 4 (if counting the one in the working machine -- 5) samples of "ivory".</p>

<p>If nothing else I appreciate this particular breakdown and how it ties together the rest of the points and I have nothing to dispute. Fwiw I said what I said in #a when I said it, because I knew that this particular breakdown is true, and it took a compromised state for me to say anything at all. I'm glad I did it, because I'd rather not have a reputation, than have a sham reputaiton. At the end of the day, the worst possible thing happened(!!1) and I'm still alive.</p>

						<p>In further lefty lulz and other mammooth huntings, I've apparently scored <a href="https://archive.is/pAqL9">comment #32</a> on the three year old blog that's the only visible remnant of that whole "socialist patient front" hysteria of the 70s.</p>
<p>It's hard to conceptualize just how utterly irrelevant the left is/ever was if such is attempted in the abstract. Until and unless one actually takes some hands-on experience with the matter, the residual impression may perdure whereby they're negligible in the sense arthropod leg segments are negligible in silo'd rice. Their situation is in fact that they're negligible in the sense unicorn fur in the tap water is negligible.</p>
