<p>Item should be remarkable especially because work on Minsk subway didn't even <em>start</em> until 1984, which is to say just about the time everyone inside the curtain was <a href=http://trilema.com/forum-logs-for-01-dec-2018#2501090>giving the fuck up</a> on the whole marx-<a href="http://trilema.com/2016/the-story-of-elliot-rodger-by-elliot-rodger-adnotated-part-nine/#footnote_6_68551">lenin</a>-<a href=http://btcbase.org/log-search?q=from%3Amircea+%22ziggler%22>ziggler</a>-<a href=http://trilema.com/2013/in-loving-memory-of-billy-mays-ass-or-rather-crack/>mays</a> "how to influence people and pull yourself up by breeches" bullshit. Moreover, construction continued throughout the 90s, <em>with stations generally finished ahead of schedule</em>, in strict contrast to just about anywhere and everywhere else. If you ever hear anyone call Belarus "a backwards nation", they might not actually intend the term in the sense you're contemplating -- but backwards, so to speak. I trust I make myself counterpointedly clear.</p>
<p>In other vaguely related stories : while the <del datetime="2019-07-07T13:58:54+00:00">girls</del> wanton sluts were enjoying the first pass of being in trouble<sup><a href="#footnote_2_84613" id="identifier_2_84613" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="They were ever so slightly unenthused and perhaps even a shade whiny, so they got sent off to drop the bags back home and meet me at this -- seemingly -- nice cafe downtown, that upon examination turned out to be a fucking self-serve shitjoint! The indignity! 
So I spent an unpleasant fifteen or twenty minutes there waiting for either my own whores or the places' service whores or both to show up, while listening to some intolerably whiny anglophone moron fall over himself in excitement that some local, passible chick was giving him the time of day -- in the most squeaky-clean, no-rape-whatsoever sense of the term, of course. What the fuck is wrong with the anglotards anyways ?! What sort of non-achievement is this, some girl listening to you whine at no personal cost to her ? If she ain't in pain, the cunt dun count, yo, tardstalk! Wake up!
And, for that matter, what the fuck is wrong with the locals, pretty much every large, centrally placed, cafe-looking thing's gonna be a sad local interpretation of a fast food joint, with no table service and no real purpose of being there ? Don't these belong at the periphery ? Why the fuck do they even let dorks in tshirts in one of these places in the first place ?! Does't marble entryway and baroque facade pretty much code for `no poor twerps allowed inside` ?! ">iii</a></sup> during this multi-troubled day<sup><a href="#footnote_3_84613" id="identifier_3_84613" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="They're in trouble right now, convicted to walk the streets and map out the damned town for me, because I was moderately inconvenienced by rain and the locals' counter-intuitive approach to real estate usage &#038; zoning earlier. #whorelife">iv</a></sup>, I stopped at a sweets and colonials shop underground, where both the serving girl and her friend killing time in the shop proceeded to pick me up. Joint and several, I dunno how to explain this, they'd have worked it either way, open handed and at my preference -- either together or apart, whichever way I wanna go. Am I in town for the games ?<sup><a href="#footnote_4_84613" id="identifier_4_84613" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="They had this `european games` whatever wanna-be event here, for which the city apparently undertook significant expenses that it can not actually afford to pay -- almost nobody showed up, as anyone (except the locals) could have obviously predicted. Consequently, all the girls ask, excitedly, if that's the source of the magical dragon, the beacon that drew strange into their tedious world ; but are then somehow unsurprised to find that no, it isn't. I just came here. `What, just like that ?!` Yes, just like that.
`Oh, she asked me to ask you where are you from.` `Where is this Costa Rica ?` `Oh, America! My ex husband once worked in Miami`. I kid you not, the one time it happened someone tried to make a link with her personal experience, it was through her ex and to fucking Miami. How can they be helped ?">v</a></sup> </p>
<p>This was the <em>third</em> time<sup><a href="#footnote_5_84613" id="identifier_5_84613" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="We're only counting the come over and say hi version -- the more traditionally discrete wink-and-nod's so overdone it defies counting.">vi</a></sup> someone made a pass at me <em>today</em>, the last of which being <em>a fucking dude</em>, approaching me in the subway on the very fucking dubious basis of his... also having a beard (no homo!). I kid you not, his idea was that we'll strike a deep and joyous 15yo friendship on the basis of beards. Then, upon discovering that I don't speak his moontalk and excusing himself with "bad Englisch, bad Englisch", he actually <em>came back at me again</em>!!! half minute later, just as unpreparedly illiterate, "we are a...a...a... how do you say it..." so I had to make the get lost hand gesture and turn away. Yes, just like one of those five-foot-nine catwalk-grade hussies stuck at some pleb function. </p>
<p>I actually had to live through the life of a hottie, with all its attendant unpleasantness, "shouldn't look that way, might be taken as encouragement" and "why am I so bitchy, he was just trying to be nice, what if I keep going like this for years and end up a complete bitch through no fault of my own, just as a natural reaction to horrible environment exposure" and so on and so forth. I dunno... maybe I might've said somewhere that dudes should talk to girls or something along those lines ?</p>
<p>Abso-fucking-lutely do not do that. It's fucking annoying. Shut the fuck up, keep your sad gaze downcast while in public and go assault your rubber <span style="background-color:#d3d3d3" id="select">glove/ducky/pillow/whatever it is at home.

<p>All that unpleasantness out of the way, let's clear our minds and purge our souls with some... industrial art.</p>

<p>I daresay it's not half bad. The mannerism of composition aside, the female form demonstrates a certain truthful carnality -- functional and natural yet counter-industrial and anti-artificial -- that shines through, lifting this modest effort and placing it somewhere between cabinet miniature and anatomy textbook -- both rather legitimate subart<sup><a href="#footnote_7_84613" id="identifier_7_84613" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Precisely as `culture` is merely the pompous endonym of peculiar subcultures, just so art is the pretentious designation of subjective subart.

<p>Above : shop. A smaller, closer version of this idiocy<sup><a href="#footnote_8_84613" id="identifier_8_84613" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="It looks just like a department store, I'll readily give you that. However, it isn't, and it isn't exactly where it'd count.
Picture me on shopping expedition. We come into a large hall, which looks more like a hotel lobby or perhaps bureaucratic officialdom entryway. I'm about to turn away, because no, I won't shop in pretentious fucking office buildings, let them adapt themselves to sanity already, when Hannah notices the actual shelves of goods off to the left, and well... I'm a tolerant kind, you know ?
In we go, and we select a knife, a spatula I think or somesuch kitchen trims, and on impulse a most delightful BDSM implement (I confess most of my tools were repurposed, starting their commercial life as items bought in construction yards, pet shops, farm outlets and so on) superficially similar to a plain dough roller, but with centimetre-edge pyramids on its entire surface. And sharp, too -- think a fifty-row Wartenberg wheel in wood rather than metal. That shit'd have hurt! Then some detergent and I dunno what, and we proceed to the counters.
There's some sort of problem, however, so I drop her to go explore the other side of this statuary complex / mausoleum. It turns out the other side's a slutstation, five thousand square feet of girly warpaint and whatnot -- including (of course!) muf detergent.
What, you think I'm kidding ? But my very dear friends... would I do such a thing ?
I am not kidding. Here : 

I sincerely hope all their advertisement is thickly and heavily about `Alexia, have you washed your muff ?!` and such.
There's (no kidding!) Frank Sinatra softly singing `Strangers in the night` somewhere in the distance. All tasteful like and shit, if your idea of taste originates in the 1950s Borscht Belt. Which...
But anyway, past the whole pile of (entirely imported) necessities... there's a power tools subsection. I could've bought myself a chainsaw! A kid, evidently bereft of human company during many long weeks, jumps right on me, but I politely refuse and turn about. The slut's still locked at the cash register ; my many-fest impatience is met by the cashier with profuse assurances that the wheels are in motion!!! As it turns out, the department store's not a department store at all, but a loose confederation of independent bums. Therefore, if you select some products from tiny aisle X, you gotta pay at the cash register attached to tiny aisle X. There's no floor-wide cashout process, they are basically insane, what the everloving fuck!
So I gesture impatiently and we're the fuck out of there, leaving a pile of goods in the store to be no doubt gazed upon in shocked amazement for days to come.
What the fuck is wrooooong with these people, why the fuck pay ten cashiers to do (poorly) the job of maybe three people ?! Money grows on trees in Minsk or what the fuck's their problem!">ix</a></sup> managed to get itself banned yesterday, so now this one's stuck getting the business (mostly <a href=http://trilema.com/2017/the-day-of-failure-trilemma/#selection-411.48-411.140>against its will</a>).</p>
<p>Below : "restaurant", not  that I'd eat there. If you ran things wouldn't have you painted that thing red and housed the "Moulin Rouge" <em>there</em>, as opposed to some indistinct <a href=http://trilema.com/forum-logs-for-05-jul-2019#2542846>storm gutter</a> ?

[<a href="#identifier_7_84613" class="footnote-link footnote-back-link">&#8617;</a>]</li><li id="footnote_8_84613" class="footnote">It <em>looks</em> just like a department store, I'll readily give you that. However, it <em>isn't</em>, and it isn't exactly where it'd count.</p>
<p>Picture me on shopping expedition. We come into a large hall, which looks more like a hotel lobby or perhaps bureaucratic officialdom entryway. I'm about to turn away, because no, I won't shop in pretentious fucking office buildings, let them adapt themselves to sanity already, when Hannah notices the actual shelves of goods off to the left, and well... I'm a tolerant kind, you know ?</p>
<p>In we go, and we select a knife, a spatula I think or somesuch kitchen trims, and on impulse a most delightful BDSM implement (I confess most of my tools were repurposed, starting their commercial life as items bought in construction yards, pet shops, farm outlets and so on) superficially similar to a plain dough roller, but with centimetre-edge pyramids on its entire surface. And sharp, too -- think a fifty-row Wartenberg wheel in wood rather than metal. That shit'd have <em>hurt</em>! Then some detergent and I dunno what, and we proceed to the counters.</p>
<p>There's some sort of problem, however, so I drop her to go explore the other side of this statuary complex / mausoleum. It turns out the other side's a slutstation, five thousand square feet of girly warpaint and whatnot -- including (of course!) muf detergent.</p>
<p>What, you think I'm kidding ? But my very dear friends... would I do such a thing ?</p>
<p>I am not kidding. Here : </p>
<p><a href="http://trilema.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fruits-10.jpg"><img src="http://trilema.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fruits-10-560x840.jpg" alt="fruits-10" title="fruits-10" width="560" height="840" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-84655" /></a></p>
<p>I sincerely hope all their advertisement is thickly and heavily about "Alexia, have you washed your muff ?!" and such.</p>
<p>There's (no kidding!) Frank Sinatra softly singing "Strangers in the night" somewhere in the distance. All tasteful like and shit, if your idea of taste originates in the 1950s Borscht Belt. Which...</p>
<p>But anyway, <em>past</em> the whole pile of (entirely imported) necessities... there's a power tools subsection. I could've bought myself a chainsaw! A kid, evidently bereft of human company during many long weeks, jumps right on me, but I politely refuse and turn about. The slut's <em>still</em> locked at the cash register ; my many-fest impatience is met by the cashier with profuse assurances that the wheels are in motion!!! As it turns out, the department store's not a department store at all, but a loose confederation of independent bums. Therefore, if you select some products from tiny aisle X, you gotta pay at the cash register attached to tiny aisle X. There's no floor-wide cashout process, they are basically insane, what the everloving fuck!</p>
<p>So I gesture impatiently and we're the fuck out of there, leaving a pile of goods in the store to be no doubt gazed upon in shocked amazement for days to come.</p>
<p>What <b>the fuck</b> is <em>wrooooong</em> with these people, why the fuck pay ten cashiers to do (poorly) the job of maybe three people ?! Money grows on trees in Minsk or what the fuck's their problem!
