                        <div class="entry">
<p>And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof ? And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon. And one of the elders saith unto me : weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof. And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</p>
<p>And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, come and see. And I saw, and beheld a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer. And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, come and see. And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword. And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, a measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine. And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, come and see. And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth. And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held: And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth ? And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow servants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled. And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood; And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind. And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places. And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains; And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: For the great day of his wrath is come; and <a href=http://trilema.com/2018/dies-irae/#selection-135.1-145.0>who shall be able to stand</a>?</p>
<p>And I beheld, and I heard <a href="http://trilema.com/2016/the-darkening/#selection-49.338-53.430">the voice of many angels</a> round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands; And as I beheld the angels cried; and as the angels cried the beasts wept; and all wept; and as all wept the throne shook; and as the throne shook the Lamb shook; and all crumbled. And as all crumbled I saw the <a href=http://trilema.com/2017/the-bitter-lot/>Bitter Lot</a> ; for the chests of the angels became as glass and as still lakewater ; and in it all as it passed could be seen. And in the chests of all the angels living I saw with my own eye the fate of other angels, and it was dire. And as I looked upon the translucent chests of translucent angels, I saw they wore no garment, and I saw the life pulse in them, and I saw their face noble, and with eyebrow arched high and eyes wide in sharp corners, and jawline delicate and neck elegant as the swans ; and full mounded breasts high upon their chests, and heaving, and crowned of small nipples, and flat bellies, and wide hips and no sex neither like woman's nor like man's, but smooth mound like polished stone and with no hair between their legs. And from their neck to their smooth mound they shone translucent, and in flickers their inner life shone through, but most of all there came through the life of other angels, and the number of them was ten million times ten million, and millions of millions.</p>
<p>And these angels flew low upon the Earth; and these angels were hounded and hunted by Homoreus. And the Homoreus were not as many, but with great craft and treachery, for the angels could not resist, but were compelled, by certain sound and of music and of prayer and of narration and of poetry and of harmony and of cymbal and sybil. And this Homoreus knew, and they made tunnels, underground and through earth and through mud and through metal, where the angels could not fly away, but had to fly through, to get to the source. And Homoreus ambushed the angels as they came, and held them fast, and trod them underfoot, and their wings trod underfoot, and their delicate wrists, and forced open their thighs, and in between the thighs they cut, with sharp blade, and cut through the smooth mound, and no blood came through, and the angels betrodden cried with no sound, and in the cut their maidenhood appeared, and in the end of Truth the angels weren't without sex, but it was under their angelhood, and through the cut appeared again in the world, and the angels were like women, and Homoreus held them down and one by one made with them held the beast of two backs, and used them like women, and changed with each other many times, and the angels betrodden cried with no sound, and thrashed underfoot, and squirmed, and lost the feathers of their wings and bruised their wrists and ribs and thighs and ankles fine. And Homoreus laughed and laughed and spat on her held down and poked her in the ribs and in the eyes and cut her nipples and her ears in two and her lips and rubbed the salt of her own tears in the wounds and of their urine. And the angels prayed but in vain ; and the angels prayed unheard ; and the angels howled their pain in silent cries ; and as the angels betrodden cried so cried the angels beholden in Heaven by the throne, their tears flowed over their full mounded breasts and down on either side of belly and in over their mound and down the inner of their thighs and by their feet where they left no mark.</p>
<p>And thrashed and thrashed and suffered their passions the angels down on earth, until each Homoreus had enough, and sated of the her within the Angel's skin, the one they had cut out of mound and out of all and into life with their sharp blades. And when they had enough they let their seed out into her, manly seed filling and fulfilling the angel's cup. And as it filled her cup their seed, it turned them, and they changed, like from an inner fire, and they burned with the flames of Hell, and into a mound of ashes. And nothing was left behind, where the Angel had been split between the thighs, and trodden upon, and forced into womanhood, but a small pile of ashes, like after a fire, and with two teardrop jewels, shining like glass and still lakewater, where the eyes before were. And these Homoreus took, and laughed and drank wine and made merry, and many of the Homoreus had many of such Angels' tears with them and still not yet enough, and cut open and used and burned yet more Angels and yet more and more and still more ; and of the Angels by the throne fewer and fewer remained, as they went, flying low upon the Earth, one after another, compelled by the calls, and from tens of thousands thousands were left, and from thousands left hundreds were left, and from hundreds left many and more left and fewer remained and the Lamb shook with every Angel leaving the throne, and the throne shook with every shake of the Lamb, and all wept as one wept, and it all crumbled and crumbled until all was done, and crumbled into just one pile of ash, and no throne could be seen, nor beasts, nor Lambs, nor anything. And Homoreus had won again, and carried the day, and from the ashes of Angels no more angels will ever rise, and no more thrones in the sky, and no more Lambs and no more cheap nonsense of little girls, for little girls.</p>
<p>Amen, and Santa Claus isn't for real either.</p>
