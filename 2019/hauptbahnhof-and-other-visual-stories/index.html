<p>Above : even more of the same. There's a lot, what can I tell you!<sup><a href="#footnote_2_83341" id="identifier_2_83341" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Actually, here's something I could tell you : the whole elevator affair involved an encounter with a Florida couple. Fifty-something, the age poor people from our colonies start showing back home. The (quite intellectually lively) male half warned me as I was trying to get into the elevator that unless I already have tickets, that's not the way to buying them (no doubt his quite healthy reaction to the frustrating arrangements the local tards had in place for the tourists' convenience). I wondered outloud where that might be then, and he proferred something about an information center somewhere.
`Ah, that's here around the corner, to the left` I produced, having just passed the damned thing. He broke out an ode to the virtues of cooperation and the personal enjoyment he takes in such, we bought our tickets, and we returned, while establishing the (apparently fundamental) point of interest for all tourists : that they're from Florida, and I'm from Romania. At this juncture the female (and quite pointedly lesser) half decided the optimal course would be to observe my English is very good! So I thanked her, and returned the compliment : so is hers. The guy laughed his ass off, while the moron he for some reason decided to (immorally) support in her utterly ridiculous (not to mention entirely spurious) misrepresentations of the self and the world surroundant kept blathering about how impressed she is, as fucking if anyone either asked or cared.

<p>Above : achtung, incorrectness ahead.<sup><a href="#footnote_3_83341" id="identifier_3_83341" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Speaking of incorrectness : we're stopped at this tiny Italian coffee house downtown, and I proceed to instruct my slavegirls in the wonders of mechanics, basic mechanisms, all that jazz. Just as I'm about done with the fulcrum and getting right and proper into a discussion of leverage, trade-offs etcetera, this older local woman asks me (in English) whether I'm talking for two people or for everyone.
Honestly my first pass interpretation was that she correctly evaluated her relative position in the world, and was most humbly begging to be allowed among the harem slaves, to complete her sad, smoldering debrispile of a life. To feel, if even for a brief moment, the warmth and glory of complete womanhood. 
However, that's entirely not what she was trying to say, notwithstanding it was quite exactly her situation. Instead, the retard was bothered by...  well, formally by my speaking too loud, but quite transparently the problem behind was that the sluts were paying attention to me. How is this possible, how can this be, that some young girls be the immediate property of a young[er] male, when her pantsuit goddess told her they all should as well as are her own, to trade as she herself seems fit ? How dare I not rent my cunt from her, but own it outright, and entirely cut her out of the loop ?! As a christian mother etc she doth must protest!!!
So I politely apologized but otherwise completely ignored her (a feat made all the easier by her own internal overwhelm) ; then ten or fiftreen minutes later as I was headed towards the bathroom along with the bimbo I inquired quite loudly where the dangerous peacekeeper might be seated ? Bimbo retorted that the old woman was transparently attention whoring (duh), to which I explained it's fucking ridiculous to imagine you're going to police the use of commercial facilities by people who order such a pile of coffees, cakes, icecreams etcetera double tables can't accomodate them, especially without as much as paying for a cup of coffee. The place exists to turn a profit, after all, not to satisfy the world expectations of the poor. 
Just as I finished loudly pronouncing the foregoing, we run into the would-be sherrif of this world and its worldy affairs, coming out of the very bathroom in question! So I tip my hat while the bimbo chuckles and we go right past her. Then once we're done we return to our table, share the amusement, then finish, pay, and leave. Just as we're getting back out into the street I order the girls to squat, which they do. I don't recall exactly why, we were talking about asses, kardashians, whatever. Why the hell not ? But just as their fabulous asses are heel-height from the ground, a very steamed self-appointed public space policewoman passes us huffingly.
I'm pretty sure she was waiting for us to get out, weaving in her overwhelmed brainbox who knows what plaintive complaint -- except she wasn't quite ready for the actual existence of the actual sluts. Such as they are, complete, whole. Not as she imagines them to be.

In fairness, the younger ones took it a lot better, a rather warm-ish "lucky her" transparent camaraderie dominating their emotional... footprint, let's say. Not so for the older ones, shooting poisonous glances everywhich way I wasn't happening to right then be looking.</p>

[<a href="#identifier_1_83341" class="footnote-link footnote-back-link">&#8617;</a>]</li><li id="footnote_2_83341" class="footnote">Actually, here's something I could tell you : the whole <a href="http://trilema.com/forum-logs-for-03-apr-2019#2529043">elevator affair</a> involved an encounter with a Florida couple. Fifty-something, the age poor people from our colonies start showing back home. The (quite intellectually lively) male half warned me as I was trying to get into the elevator that unless I already have tickets, that's not the way to buying them (no doubt his quite healthy reaction to the frustrating arrangements the local tards had in place for the tourists' convenience). I wondered outloud where that might be then, and he proferred something about an information center somewhere.</p>
<p>"Ah, that's here around the corner, to the left" I produced, having just passed the damned thing. He broke out an ode to the virtues of cooperation and the personal enjoyment he takes in such, we bought our tickets, and we returned, while establishing the (apparently fundamental) point of interest for all tourists : that they're from Florida, and I'm from Romania. At this juncture the female (and quite pointedly lesser) half decided the optimal course would be to observe my English is very good! So I thanked her, and returned the compliment : so is hers. The guy laughed his ass off, while the moron he for some reason decided to (immorally) support in her utterly ridiculous (not to mention entirely spurious) misrepresentations of the self and the world surroundant kept blathering about how impressed she is, as fucking if anyone either asked or cared.</p>
<p>You're not beating them nearly enough, seriously now. Is there to be absolutely no limit to menopausal female impudence ? [<a href="#identifier_2_83341" class="footnote-link footnote-back-link">&#8617;</a>]</li><li id="footnote_3_83341" class="footnote">Speaking of incorrectness : we're stopped at this tiny Italian coffee house downtown, and I proceed to instruct my slavegirls in the wonders of mechanics, basic mechanisms, all that jazz. Just as I'm about done with the fulcrum and getting right and proper into a discussion of leverage, trade-offs etcetera, this older local woman asks me (in English) whether I'm talking for two people or for everyone.</p>
<p>Honestly my first pass interpretation was that she correctly evaluated her relative position in the world, and was most humbly begging to be allowed among the harem slaves, to complete her sad, smoldering debrispile of a life. To feel, if even for a brief moment, the warmth and glory of complete womanhood. </p>
<p>However, that's entirely not what she was trying to say, notwithstanding it was quite exactly her situation. Instead, the retard was bothered by...  well, formally by my speaking too loud, but quite transparently the problem behind was that the sluts were paying attention <em>to me</em>. How is this possible, how can this be, that some young girls be the immediate property of a young[er] male, when her pantsuit goddess told her they all should as well as are her own, to trade as she herself seems fit ? How <a href=http://trilema.com/2016/usg-in-btc-a-history-of-constant-failure/#selection-39.0-39.51>dare I</a> not rent my cunt from her, but own it outright, and entirely cut her out of the loop ?! As a christian mother etc she doth must protest!!!</p>
<p>So I politely apologized but otherwise completely ignored her (a feat made all the easier by her own internal overwhelm) ; then ten or fiftreen minutes later as I was headed towards the bathroom along with the bimbo I inquired quite loudly where the dangerous peacekeeper might be seated ? Bimbo retorted that the old woman was transparently attention whoring (duh), to which I explained it's fucking ridiculous to imagine you're going to police the use of commercial facilities by people who order such a pile of coffees, cakes, icecreams etcetera double tables can't accomodate them, especially without as much as paying for a cup of coffee. The place exists to turn a profit, after all, not to satisfy the world expectations of the poor. </p>
<p>Just as I finished loudly pronouncing the foregoing, we run into the would-be sherrif of this world and its worldy affairs, coming out of the very bathroom in question! So I tip my hat while the bimbo chuckles and we go right past her. Then once we're done we return to our table, share the amusement, then finish, pay, and leave. Just as we're getting back out into the street I order the girls to squat, which they do. I don't recall exactly why, we were talking about asses, kardashians, whatever. Why the hell not ? But just as their fabulous asses are heel-height from the ground, a very steamed self-appointed public space policewoman passes us huffingly.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure she was waiting for us to get out, weaving in her overwhelmed brainbox who knows what plaintive complaint -- except she wasn't quite ready for the <em>actual</em> existence of the <em>actual</em> sluts. Such as they are, complete, whole. Not as she imagines them to be.</p>
