<p>Let me tell you what I've been up to. But before that, a quote :</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>KRS|gotyawallet</strong> Some chatter already that btc is all over.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Already ? It's been the talk of the town ever since we started raping the town, back in 2011. It's like... o buttcoins are worthless, o buttcoins aren't useful o buttcoins are a scam etc etc.</p>
<p><strong>KRS|gotyawallet</strong> That's true forgot all that it's been good for a while..good point..<br />
<strong>ruru</strong> Let them panic... my poor buddy sold.. 400+ BTC, got $280k. Then.. guess what. Bought back when BTC rebounded. He got fucked bothways by the market.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Buttways.</p>
<p><strong>ruru</strong> Lost around 57 BTC in the process.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> That BTC didn't belong in his hands obviously.</p>
<p><strong>Duffer1</strong> I can empathize with the scammed, but not those on the losing end of speculation.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Dunno whether speculation or just panic.</p>
<p><strong>ruru</strong> It was panic... Dumped @ low 600s, put a bid @ 600.. then, pulled it for some reason. He wasn't at the right state of mind.</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Daytrading without a license.</p></blockquote>
<p>People ask me just about daily by now, "dude, you're worth whatever, half a million to a full million BTC depending how the <a href="http://mpex.co/?mpsic=S.MPOE">stock market</a> is doing that day, how can you stand it ?!?!?!". Well, I'll tell you how I can stand it : I had a dream.</p>
<p>I don't mean when I was a little boy or <del datetime="2013-12-08T14:08:12+00:00">retarded</del> inspirational shit like that, I mean just now, before waking up, I had a dream.

People were there, not physically recognised, but identified by their... impression, by a feeling, a sort of aura. As often the case is in dreams. </p>
<p>So basically I was leading the #bitcoin-assets channel harpy hunting party. Nobody had even seen a harpy, everyone however was in agreement that I know what I'm doing, and even perhaps that I hunted harpies before. Many times. I believed this too, in my dream, notwithstanding I couldn't recall a case of actually having hunted a harpy in the past. But what is the past to a dream ? I had a clear idea what a harpy looks like, not physically of course, but as an.. impression. A feeling, perhaps like an aura. And we were climbing up these jagged shards of rock in a dimly lit, reddish dusk with billowing thick smoke all around, and you could hear sqweaks and otherworldly cries in the distance. </p>

						<p>In my humble opinion, the MMORPG is being replaced by the MOBA as the Next Big Thing (yeah yeah I know it's not quite the same target demographic). </p>
<p>Consider that the mmorpg was supposed to be the natural successor of the rpg. Should've been a world where you can take refuge from RL and interpret a fantastic character. That assumption is flawed, in that aggregated masses of people are never good actors and never can pull off convincing mass RP. Taking roleplay out, you're left with enforcing lore with game mechanics and obeying the powerplayers. Casuals just want to have the endgame fun (and therefore pour money if they can help it), hardcore players (by which I mean young adults, kids etc) just sink in time. It doesn't make sense to require an upfront payment and monthly subs, it turns off those who can't afford it. Instead, you go "f2p", meaning you cripple everyone's experience and force them to cough at least some money up.  My best example is Lotro - technically f2p, but you have to buy 1 month VIP unless you're a masochist (unlocks a lot of useful stuff), also you have to buy access to new regions (so you buy the ability to grind, lol). That's $15 for VIP and some $39.99 for all packs combined (guess it's more if you buy separately). If Turbine asked everyone to pay all that upfront, how many would do it?</p>
<p>Anyway, the f2p debate notwithstanding, the genre is fucked because of this simple truth: in any game people want to kill monsters (or players in pvp), defeat the overload and save the princess.</p>
<p>Well, consider MOBAs: a game takes between 30 minutes and a couple hours, but you don't have to come back daily for a raid or for well-timed quests. You start killing stuff from minute 1 and you can attempt to kill other players soon after. There's still lots of width to explore (due to the sheer pool of heroes), still some depth due to the role combinations, and overall less stress. No grinding just for the endgame. No roleplay. No daily quests which you feel compelled to complete because you're running out of stuff to do (I remember this friend playing WoW, he had to open some 1k boxes for a stupid title). Just pure, raw killing starting from minute 1.</p>
<p>I might be wrong, of course, but I don't see much future in the MMORPG genre. Blizzard keeps offering to level old players to 80 or so, just so that they return; that's a tacit acknowledging of the grind model, and of the dwindling server population. Other games are worse off, with no serious contender for WoW even existing.</p>
<p>tl;dr Rift is not even WoW.</p>

						<p>I'm not so sure these "succession" arguments work so well. </p>
<p>So Sonic and Mario have mutated into something a lot more complex these days, whereas MM/Gothic/EQ/etc have mutated into something a lot simpler. These two happen to be the same thing, exactly at the time when cost pressure make it impossible for companies to justify even moderate expenses* and so two otherwise separate genres are being merged into a single thing "with elements" of each, much like a communist dictatorship might invent a new drink to replace coffee and tea, with "taste elements" of both coffee and tea.</p>
<p>If history is any guide we will have a scatter, a new renaissance, a new contraction and so on and so forth. The renaissance mm6 and animaniacs were part of is only the fifth or something.</p>
<p>Hardcore players is exactly the opposite of kids/young adults. Hardcore players are in general professionally accomplished engineers past their 30s. That if your game is any good. Otherwise, they're markedly absent, with all sorts of retards doing a sort of Hardcorer of the Flies.</p>
<p>I would debate the "cripple everyone's experience" is in any way related to the f2p model per se. I don't see how it cripples anyone's experience as implemented in Rift, for instance. It doesn't work, sure, but for fundamental reasons, this ux cripplage is strictly an implementation issue.</p>
<p>Rift is actually better than WoW I think, but the reasons are subtle and I'm still working sussing them out. Also, Eulora is going to kick butt being precisely an old style mmorpg in Bitcoin. You shall see, do not despair just yet.</p>
<p>---<br />
* Sure, 50mn sounds like a shitload of money, up until you stop and think about it. Then you realise the average power plant costs billions, and power plants are quite so unremarkable as to pass unnoticed, even though they're ubiquitous. When's the last time you read an interview with a power plant manager, even though that guy manages more than the entire gaming industry combined ? Same argument about roads and so on and so forth. The big dig was 50 billion, right ?</p>

						<p>"Hardcore players is exactly the opposite of kids/young adults. Hardcore players are in general professionally accomplished engineers past their 30s."</p>
<p>I think this may just be centric to your observation of USian gamers, and doesn't include those <a href="http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/virtuafighter/virtuafighter4.htm" >who time the frames</a> for combos. These groups of players are far from "professionally accomplished engineers past their 30s".</p>
<p>There was a whole culture of black arcade rats who mastered a slew of fighting games, from Killer Instinct, to Street Fighter. These competitions were happening long before the advent of Kim Dotcom's fatass competing in Call of Duty, or the Starcraft Tournaments, or the retardism that is a DoTA competition.</p>
<p>This particular group of fighting game masters were mainly groups of teenaged delinquents, or "hoodrats". </p>
<p>I would argue the "professional" class of player varies from genre to genre, as well as through the times.</p>
