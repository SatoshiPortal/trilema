<p>I've said it before<sup><a href="#footnote_0_46497" id="identifier_0_46497" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Mostly in Romanian, it's true : Alogia, aphasia si prostia, Wikipedia, bordelul si cultura, Best of Wikipedia, Wikocrisy. I guess it's high time I wrote a piece detailing the matter in English too.">i</a></sup>, but it bears repeating : Wikipedia is neither useful nor an encyclopedia. Wikipedia is a support website for the mentally retarded. </p>
<p>To illustrate this point, let us quote a page off this pretend-encyclopedia that's really a support website for the mentally retarded. We're not going to pick at random, we're going to pick something significant. I will venture the educated guess that perhaps the most significant topic of concern for the mentally retarded is "bullying", and so it would make a good pick.</p>
<p>To be sure, this "bullying" is the universal, necessary and socially productive activity of kids putting other <em>inferior</em> kids in their inferior place. It constructs a somewhat artificial play-hierarchy in the rather artificial space of schooling groups, which allows the infantile brain to develop correctly and then later function adequately in normal human society, which is strictly hierarchical. Absent this necessary development the resulting adults will be incapable of normal functioning - and this theoretical expectation is plenty borne by the results of everyday practice. I submit that the cause for the unemployable youth, both in Europe and the US, is exactly the fact that what counts today as youth has gone through schools where normal bullying was being stupidly interfered with by the sort of retards that currently do education in these areas.<sup><a href="#footnote_1_46497" id="identifier_1_46497" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="It is a sad observation that in a world where women are allowed to work, the only people left `at home` educating the children are those women too stupid to obtain any other sort of employment. Too dumb, fat and lazy to be a nurse, a waitress, a stripper even ? Fine, she can be a teacher then. Outlandish as this may sound it is exactly, but exactly, how it works in practice.">ii</a></sup> There's a simple explanation for the sudden deluge of 30 yo bodies powered by 5 yo minds. That explanation is to be found precisely in the "progress" of limiting bullying in the past couple of decades.  </p>
<p>So, without further ado, the article in question : </p>
<blockquote><p><b>School bullying</b><br />
From Wikipedia, the retard encyclopedia </p>
<ul>This article primarily concerns student-related bullying at school. For teacher-related bullying at school, see Bullying in teaching.	The examples and perspective in this article may not represent a worldwide view of the subject. Please improve this article and discuss the issue on the talk page. (December 2010) </ul>
<p>Bullying, of which one form is depicted in this staged photograph, is detrimental to students’ well-being and development.
</p></blockquote>
<p>False statement of fact #1.</p>
<blockquote><p>School bullying is a type of bullying in which occurs during the time period a child is in school. Bullying can be physical, verbal, or emotional.</p>
<p>There is some research suggesting that a significant portion of "normal" school children may not evaluate school-based violence (student-on-student victimization) as negatively or as being unacceptable as much as adults generally do, and may even derive enjoyment from it, and they may thus not see a reason to prevent it, if it brings them joy on some level. Both males and females have differently toll on how they bully their victims. Men/boys usually bully other boys in physical ways like pushing, punching, and aggression, whereas females are more likely to spread rumors, talk bad about the person, etc. Although they are different ways in which boys and girls do bullying a lot of the ways may be similar as well, and they both can be bullied or be the bullies.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Research actually contradicts foregoing false statement of fact. This causes the mentally retarded absolutely no cognitive cramps : they happily thread right ahead with the sort of nonsense they sprout. What, pray tell, would "talk bad about the person, etc" mean ? In what retcon<sup><a href="#footnote_2_46497" id="identifier_2_46497" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Short for Retard Confabulation ?">iii</a></sup> of general literacy does this sort of crap belong ? Not "belong in an encyclopedia" I mean, but belong in written form at all.</p>
<blockquote><p>Bullying can also be perpetrated by teachers and the school system itself. There is an inherent power differential in the system that can easily predispose to subtle or covert abuse (relational aggression or passive aggression), humiliation, or exclusion — even while maintaining overt commitments to anti-bullying policies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ostensibly this would be making kids learn, marking them down if they dont, making kids behave, humiliating them if they don't and all the rest of normal school functioning. </p>
<blockquote><p>Anti-bullying programs are designed to teach students cooperation, as well as training peer moderators in intervention and dispute resolution techniques, as a form of peer support.[citation needed]</p></blockquote>
<p>Quite needed, that citation. Further citations needed : as to why cooperation should be taught to the detriment of competition, seeing how cooperation is the failure mode of human behaviour<sup><a href="#footnote_3_46497" id="identifier_3_46497" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This is a point of fact. All mammals revert to cooperation in dire circumstances, but normally behave competitively.">iv</a></sup> ; as to why we suspect children could be taught to act as "moderators" for their "peers" (and why do we suspect children are peers in the first place) ; as to why we think it's not harmful to make children take on the role of teachers and more importantly as to whether we're really sure this isn't actually training them for Stockholm syndrome. What is this school supposed to produce, rats ? </p>

<p>I particularly like 10 Identifying and 11.1 Victims. These are the sorts of titles indicative of the IQ of the authors of this crap : somewhere higher than 10 but under 11.1.</p>
<blockquote><p>Types of school bullying include<br />
Physical<br />
See also: Physical abuse</p>
<p>A female bully, portrayed in the 1917 silent film Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.</p>
<p>Physical bullying is any unwanted physical contact between the bully and the victim. This is one of the most easily identifiable forms of bullying. Examples include:<br />
punching<br />
pushing<br />
shoving<br />
kicking<br />
inappropriate touching<br />
tickling<br />
headlocks<br />
school pranks<br />
teasing<br />
fighting<br />
use of available objects as weapons</p></blockquote>
<p>Unwanted by whom ? Not a question the authors have the intellectual sophistication to consider. "Types include" is the wrong way to start an ennumeration. If your ennumeration is not complete either you have a damned good reason which gets discussed or else you have more work to do before writing encyclopedic articles on the topic. "This is one of the most" does not belong in written matter past the ninth grade. Use of unavailable objects as weapons I would wish to see demonstrated. I'd even pay for the privilege of witnessing this miracle. </p>
<p>It is possibly worth noting that there's no relation between tickling, school pranks, teasing and whatnot and "Physical abuse". As a refresher, physical abuse (cum inappropriate touching) is this : </p>
<p><a href="http://trilema.com//dtng/c/res/244.html"><img src="http://trilema.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/wikipedia-retards.jpg" alt="wikipedia-retards" title="wikipedia-retards" width="560" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46514" /></a></p>
<p>The girl depicted above is tied so that all her weight rests on her knees, which is in most cases painful. The touching part goes on inside her mouth and is not entirely visible in the image. I feel obliged to note these points explicitly given the intellectual penetration displayed by our good friends the wikipedians so far. </p>
<p>So! As long as the child isn't tied naked wrist to ankle behind his or her back and has a cock inserted orally we aren't dealing with physical abuse. Yes, this is the golden standard by which bullying has to be judged. Moving on.</p>
<blockquote><p>Emotional<br />
See also: Psychological abuse</p>
<p>Emotional bullying is any form of bullying that causes damage to a victim’s psyche and/or emotional well-being. Examples include:<br />
spreading malicious rumors about people<br />
keeping certain people out of a "group"<br />
getting certain people to "gang up" on others (It also could be considered physical bullying)<br />
making fun of certain people<br />
ignoring people on purpose – the silent treatment, also known as 'Sending to Coventry'<br />
harassment<br />
provocation<br />
saying hurting sentences</p></blockquote>
<p>I suppose this entire article consists of saying "hurting" sentences, just as the observation that the correct form of the hurt root in that context is <em>hurtful</em> would be... hurtful ? Hurting ? What's next, stating e = mc<sup>2</sup> is hurtful because it privileges the speed of light over other speeds much more important to us ?<sup><a href="#footnote_4_46497" id="identifier_4_46497" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Yes, that's a quote. Source it.">v</a></sup></p>
<p>Ignoring people on purpose, for that matter, is the cornerstone of civilised society. This is how it functions : I ignore all these idiots by never giving them any money. Everyone else of any importance or value in human society does the same. Consequently, to quote Jimblow,</p>
<blockquote><p>Google might have close to a million servers. Yahoo has something like 13,000 staff. We have 400 servers and 143 staff.</p></blockquote>
<p>There's a reason for that you know. The reason is called ignoring "people" on purpose. But moving on...</p>
<blockquote><p>Verbally<br />
See also: Verbal abuse</p>
<p>Verbal bullying is any slanderous statements or accusations that cause the victim undue emotional distress. Examples include:<br />
directing foul language (profanity) at the target<br />
using derogatory terms or playing with the person's name<br />
commenting negatively on someone's looks, clothes, body etc. – personal abuse<br />
tormenting<br />
harassment<br />
being laughed at<br />
teasing
</p></blockquote>
<p>Today I've learned that the categories of physical and emotional do not cover the entire spectrum. There's a third, "verbal". Let alone that the two aren't of the same nature as this third, let alone that only a third grader (of any actual age, but mentally a third grader) could actually write this confusedly, let alone anything else. "Verbal". Such as... being laughed at.</p>
<p>Wouldn't this be a perfect world for retards to live in, seriously now. A magical place where you can mangle your phrases however you wish because nobody ever laughs at you, "says hurting things" however you may perceive them and never, ever, ignores you. A magical place where you don't end up tied up on your knees with a cock down your throat in short order if that's all you're good for. </p>
<p>There's a problem with this : I do not wish to live in a world that's comfortable for retards. Furthermore, if you do that's entirely your problem, but if you try to act on this wish of yours sooner or later we will meet. And our encounter will consist of you naked, tied, on your knees. I might not bother to stick my own cock down yout throat, sure, but I can also guarantee you'll have someone's organ down there. Mark it down, it is a promise.</p>
<blockquote><p>Cyber-bullying<br />
Main article: Cyber-bullying</p>
<p>Cyber-bullying is any bullying done through the use of technology. This form of bullying can easily go undetected because of lack of parental/authoritative supervision. Because bullies can pose as someone else, it is the most anonymous form of bullying. Cyber bullying includes, but is not limited to, abuse using email, blog, instant messaging, text messaging, or websites. A lot of kids who are bullied in school are likely to be bullied over the internet, and vice versa.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So, does using an aluminum baseball bat count as "using technology" ? I ask because the retards might not know, but aluminum is not a metal available to the primitive. The only way to produce it is through a complex and energetically-intensive electrolysis process, for which reason as late as the XVIIIth century a small box made out of metallic aluminum was a gift fit for a king. </p>
<p>Or is it the case that for the mentally retarded masquerading as "encyclopedia editors" the word technology carries meaning in the difuse, indistinct and certainly undefined manner in which language works for the uneducated ? Like a "you know" sort of "cool" thing, basically. </p>
<p>Fuck that. Words have meanings, and this is important. More important, much much more important than the happiness, the well being and even the continued existance of one, ten or ten billion "encyclopedia editors". </p>
<blockquote><p>
Sexual<br />
Main article: Sexual bullying</p>
<p>Sexual bullying is "any bullying behavior, whether physical or non-physical, that is based on a person’s sexuality or gender. It is when sexuality or gender is used as a weapon by boys or girls towards other boys or girls — although it is more commonly directed at girls. It can be carried out to a person’s face, behind their back or through the use of technology."</p>
<p>As part of its research into sexual bullying in schools, the BBC Panorama program commissioned a questionnaire aimed at young people aged 11–19 years in schools and youth clubs across five regions of England. The survey revealed that of the 273 young people who responded to the questionnaire, 28 had been forced to do something sexual and 31 had seen it happen to someone else. Of the 273 respondents, 40 had experienced unwanted touching. UK Government figures show that in school year 2007/8, there were 3,450 fixed period exclusions and 120 expulsions from schools in England due to sexual misconduct. This includes incidents such as groping and using sexually insulting language. From April 2008 to March 2009, ChildLine counselled a total of 156,729 children. Of these, 26,134 children spoke about bullying as a main concern and 300 of these talked specifically about sexual bullying.</p>
<p>Some people, including the UK charity Beatbullying, have claimed that children are being bullied into providing ‘sexual favours’ in exchange for protection as gang culture enters inner city schools. Other anti-bullying groups and teachers' unions, including the National Union of Teachers, challenged the charity to provide evidence of this, as they had no evidence that this sort of behaviour was happening in schools.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Sexual "bullying" happens to be the perhaps unwelcome but nevertheless absolutely necessary manifestation of sexuality in pubescent and adolescent individuals. Yes, the boys impose on the girls. Guess what ? That's a girl's life, until the day she dies. Being a woman means you'll be imposed upon, to get impregnated, to deliver, to nurse. Get used to the idea, because it is not going away. </p>
<p>The idea of taking what children "spoke of" seriously is also beyond the pale. Who cares what children think, of anything ? That's what being an adult means, that people now take what you have to say seriously at least to some degree and in some contexts. Children do not have this benefit, they are to be seen and not heard. Consequently all this asking for children's take on things has got to cease. They're here to learn how things are and alter themselves to fit, not to tell how things are and expect others alter themselves to fit.</p>
<p>The idea of making "studies" on voluntary respondents is about what you'd expect of the sort of mentally retarded authors of this entire piece. Never heard of definitions for words, so then of course they'd never have heard of bias. Never heard of aluminum extraction technology, so then of course they'd never have heard of the scientific method. And then this crap is quoted and since nobody has my ungodly patience to call retards retards nobody actually knows what sort of crap is being passed for "respectable". The BBC Panorama program is shit, yo! Might as well write it by pulling guts out of recently butchered goats (which weigh the same as a duck and therefore are made of wood).</p>
<p>Finally, putting out for protection is a feature of primitive society. That's how your great-grandmothers got married in the first place, yo. As the school system is being run by retards it will necessarily revert to that primitive state. The people at fault for girls being forced into sucking cock they don't want just because they're in school are <em>precisely</em> the <del>teacher</del>retard's unions. That they "have no evidence" of it is unsurprising : not only the absence of any interest to have such evidence but moreover the absence of the intellectual ability to perceive any evidence of anything whatsoever sufficiently explain the state of affairs. That aside, yes I could have oral sex with twelve year old girls in any UK large town if I wanted to. Tomorrow. It wouldn't even cost very much, and I certainly wouldn't have to speak to the victim, just pay the proper pimp. Well done, folks!</p>
<blockquote><p>Homophobic bullying<br />
Main article: Gay bullying</p>
<p>Doctor Melinda Gentry Executive Director of an Atlanta Based Non-Profit created a task force that addressed the issue of bullying as it relates to sexual orientation. "After working in Atlanta Public Schools, Atlanta, Georgia, I experienced bullying first hand. Due to my sexual orientation my co-workers rallied to have me demoted so that I was not in charge of them. I was told that I was not wanted or welcomed in the school. I was hired to empower children and as a resort I was demoralized. There was no support in the community. People need to be represented, I am an advocate for Human Rights of LGBT individuals in the community. These individuals pay taxes, raise articulate citizens and they love and respect others; they deserve reciprocity. I know from my own experience that bullying takes place in elementary and secondary schools. People in positions of authority do not always respect diversity. The House of Pink Inc. is working to create strategies to combat school bullying. It is unacceptable for adults and/or children to be bullied in schools based on the premises of their sexuality. Schools need a unified system that strategically addresses issues such as bullying and violence. These issues are often minimized but have a very long lasting effect on the individuals involved. Victims of bullying become victims of domestic violence in the future. Bullying is a precursor for other acts of civil and criminal violations. The studies on the number of children and adults who become suicidal or murdered in hate crime acts are ridiculously high and there needs to be something done now." Doctor Melinda Gentry.[clarification needed]</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, the Equality and Human Rights Commission reported in 2010 that "Homophobic bullying is widespread in British secondary schools. Nearly half of all secondary schoolteachers in England acknowledge that such bullying is common, and just 1 in 6 believe that their school is very active in promoting respect for LGBT students."
</p></blockquote>
<p>Nice self promo there, Doctor Melinda. Here's the problem tho : schoolchildren ain't gay. Being gay is much like reading this Kafka novel, half way through you realise this is all off, and if you trace back you might notice a much earlier point where things took a swing for the weird. However, you can't say that the novel was weird starting at that early point, except in retrospect. </p>
<p>School children are panamorous, they love innanimate objects, their mothers, other boys, other girls, cats, dogs... nothing wrong with that. Specialisation comes later in the sexual life of the individual.</p>

						<p>Absolutely!!<br />
Of course we are not talking 1 on 1 care here. Mom goes to work and gets paid say 10 bucks and hour, then pays a daycare center 2 bucks an hour - - which pays some poorly qualified person 8 bucks an hour to watch 15 kids ... everybody loses</p>

						<p>Well not everybody, no. Looky : </p>
<p>A. Man goes to work, woman stays at home and raises kids. State makes tax on one salary, and it can't be too high because men take a much worse attitude to people taking their shit.</p>
<p>A+. Woman also goes to work, makes fiddy cents, of which 20 are tax. Some other idiot makes thirty cents to watch fifteen kids, so another 2 are tax. A+ because state makes at least 22 cents more tax this way. </p>
<p>Not to mention that having a majority of the workforce pussies makes taxation much more practical. </p>
<p>This, of course, in an oversimplified view of reality. By which I mean it's a whole lot more than 22 cents.</p>

						<p>Pai risca pe ma-sa ca doara camera n-o fost omologata. </p>
<p>Nu-i o metoda functionala de-a "dezvata tiganii de furat", ce vezi tu acolo. E o metoda de-ai invata ca-s cetateni de mina a doua, ceea ce e intr-adevar o chestie dorita de-un grup da' nu neaparat o chestie dezirabila asa in general. Ca sa chiar functioneze in sensu' descris ar trebui sa-l fi inchis tac-su, sau in tot cazu' ceva autoritate universala si indiscutabila. Faptu' ca nustiuce nene de pe strada te-o speriat de te-ai cacat pe tine cind aveai sapte ani nu inseamna neaparat mare lucru (si la rigoare poa' sa insemne ca te faci hot de biciclete cind mai cresti mare numa' asa, de chichi).</p>
<p>Nu exista, din principiu, o metoda universala de orice ar fi, sa invete ori sa dezvete. Nu exista tratamente universale adecvate dupa categorii : nu exista un "proper way" de-a trata femeile, tiganii, turcii, copii, curvele, gheii, puletii cu ochi albastrii verzi or maro. Eventual poa' sa existe un mod adecvat de-a trata hirciogii, chit ca adecvarea aia are sens numa'-n contextu' limitat al unei ferme comerciale de produs hirciogi.</p>

						<p>Leaving <a href="http://jer-skepticscorner.blogspot.ro/2009/12/wikipedias-climate-doctor.html" >this</a> here</p>
<blockquote><p>Even before the Climategate Emails came to light, the problem posed by the Medieval Warm Period to this band was known. “We have to get rid of the Medieval Warm Period” read a pre-Climategate email, circa 1995, as attested to at hearings of the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment &amp; Public Works. But the Climategate transcripts were more extensive and more illuminating — they provided an unvarnished look at the struggles that the climate practitioners underwent before settling on their scientific dogma.</p>
<p>The Climategate Emails showed, for example, that some members of the band were uncomfortable with aspects of their work, some even questioning the need to erase the existence of the Medieval Warm Period 1,000 years earlier.</p>
<p>Said Briffa, one of their chief practitioners: “I know there is pressure to present a nice tidy story as regards ‘apparent unprecedented warming in a thousand years or more in the proxy data’ but in reality the situation is not quite so simple. … I believe that the recent warmth was probably matched about 1,000 years ago.”</p>
<p>In the end, Briffa and other members of the band overcame their doubts and settled on their dogma. With the help of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the highest climate change authority of all, they published what became the icon of their movement — the hockey stick graph. This icon showed temperatures in the last 1,000 years to have been stable — no Medieval Warm Period, not even the Little Ice Age of a few centuries ago.</p>
<p>But the UN’s official verdict that the Medieval Warm Period had not existed did not erase the countless schoolbooks, encyclopedias, and other scholarly sources that claimed it had. Rewriting those would take decades, time that the band members didn’t have if they were to save the globe from warming.</p>
<p>Instead, the band members turned to their friends in the media and to the blogosphere, creating a website called RealClimate.org. “The idea is that we working climate scientists should have a place where we can mount a rapid response to supposedly ‘bombshell’ papers that are doing the rounds” in aid of “combating dis-information,” one email explained, referring to criticisms of the hockey stick and anything else suggesting that temperatures today were not the hottest in recorded time. One person in the nine-member Realclimate.org team — U.K. scientist and Green Party activist William Connolley — would take on particularly crucial duties.</p>
<p>Connolley took control of all things climate in the most used information source the world has ever known – Wikipedia. Starting in February 2003, just when opposition to the claims of the band members were beginning to gel, Connolley set to work on the Wikipedia site. He rewrote Wikipedia’s articles on global warming, on the greenhouse effect, on the instrumental temperature record, on the urban heat island, on climate models, on global cooling. On Feb. 14, he began to erase the Little Ice Age; on Aug.11, the Medieval Warm Period. In October, he turned his attention to the hockey stick graph. He rewrote articles on the politics of global warming and on the scientists who were skeptical of the band. Richard Lindzen and Fred Singer, two of the world’s most distinguished climate scientists, were among his early targets, followed by others that the band especially hated, such as Willie Soon and Sallie Baliunas of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, authorities on the Medieval Warm Period.</p>
<p>All told, Connolley created or rewrote 5,428 unique Wikipedia articles. His control over Wikipedia was greater still, however, through the role he obtained at Wikipedia as a website administrator, which allowed him to act with virtual impunity. When Connolley didn’t like the subject of a certain article, he removed it — more than 500 articles of various descriptions disappeared at his hand. When he disapproved of the arguments that others were making, he often had them barred — over 2,000 Wikipedia contributors who ran afoul of him found themselves blocked from making further contributions. Acolytes whose writing conformed to Connolley’s global warming views, in contrast, were rewarded with Wikipedia’s blessings. In these ways, Connolley turned Wikipedia into the missionary wing of the global warming movement.</p>
<p>The Medieval Warm Period disappeared, as did criticism of the global warming orthodoxy. With the release of the Climategate Emails, the disappearing trick has been exposed. The glorious Medieval Warm Period will remain in the history books, perhaps with an asterisk to describe how a band of zealots once tried to make it disappear.</p></blockquote>
