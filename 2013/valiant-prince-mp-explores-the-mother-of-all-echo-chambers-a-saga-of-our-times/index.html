<p>I remember a full-page advertisement in a national newspaper, back when I was in high school, from the state horseracing-betting agency. It tried to say that investing $20 in gold, or rare books, or spending money on cultural activities was exactly the same as "investing" $20 in bets at the track. "You learn valuable skills and information that will be useful in future bets! "</p>
<p>"Investing" in buttcoin is the same. It's gambling/speculation, not investing.</p>

You don't need to d/l the whole massive thing to use BitCoin. You just set up a wallet on blockchain.info. You only need the blockchain if you plan on mining. </p>
<hr /><strong>Cursed Lumberjack</strong><br />
I bet there are lots of people in developing countries across the globe who would answer with a hearty "Hell yes!" if you asked them, "Would you like to carry your own money around and be responsible for its safety at all times rather than entrusting it to a richer and more heavily armed corporation of people dedicated to holding and keeping money safe?" I mean, why would you want your currency held by someone whose job it is to hold it? Sounds inefficient to me. </p>

<p>How are these things related at all? The real question is if you are using that $1800 to continue investing in bitcoin or did you cash out? You can admit you gambled back then and how lucky you were to win or you can argue how your bitcoins are truly a smart investment. Neither of those are smart decisions anyone should try to emulate even if you made a profit this time. </p>

<p>Gambling with bitcoins is the same as investing in oil. </p>
<p>Just to make me laugh more: What are the relevant information that make bitcoins go up or down?</p>
<p>I'll give an example for oil: projected future demand, projected future supply, energy technology developments, adoption of other energy technologies (coal, solar, wind, nuclear), developments in car manufacturing and so on. </p>
<hr /><strong>The Bible</strong><br />
Oil has real uses that can be predicted. Bitcoins don't really even exist. They exist solely for speculation. </p>

<p>To explain why this is not a really viable method to make money: It's not easy to say if butts are goind down overall or going up. If you buy at some point after bitcoins have gone down for a while, they could still go down even further. And if they go up they could just as well crash again before you decide to sell. Add in greed, unfounded optimisim and pessimism and you hopefully can see how it's nothing but pure luck. </p>

<p>Very kind of you, but I'm affraid you've missed the point.</p>
<p>The US itself was subject to speculation in recent history, wholesale. Apparently around 1800 it was quite unclear for the world (which at the time = Europe) whether this new and untested venture is worth anything. This figured prominently in a few crises but otherwise was the leading force all through American history of the time : European speculation. </p>
<p>Not a strictly American phenomenon either, railroads started out by being speculative investments. The first joint stock companies (in England) are still notorious for having included among their ranks one "carrying on an undertaking of great advantage, but no one to know what it is". </p>
<p>To sum it up for you : it's a very weak argument against any new thing to show that "it is speculative". What's next, you're going to argue against children because "they can't even hold their shit in" ?<br />
<font color=lightgray><br />
<hr />
<strong>Lucy Heartfilia</strong><br />
It's not even speculative. It's pure gambling. Are you even reading this loving thread?</p>
<p>Why bitcoin won't go up over the long run:<br />
1) Butts don't scale up at all.<br />
2) Because of 1, decreasing mining rewards, greed and mining being ruled by an oligopoly transaction fees will skyrocket.<br />
3) Butts are inconvenient.<br />
4) Butts are insecure.<br />
5) Butts are deflationary.</p>
<p>Why bitcoins will ultimately go down:<br />
1) The biggest usage for butts are gambling (idiots call it 'speculation') and illegal things like drugs, money laundering and child pornography. This will cause government intervention sooner or later.<br />
2) Exchanges are run by idiots. This is where the government already intervened.<br />
3) Everyone who uses butts is either an idiot (largest proportion), scammer or otherwise criminal and oftentimes both at the same time. This is the case because non-dumbs and people with legal transactions can easily use other services.<br />
4) This is a long shot, but I believe in the future all transactions will have names attached to them and cash will be phased out. It's just a matter of adoption and convenience now.</p>
<p>In short: Don't loving buy btc you idiots! </p>

Tell me more about bitcoin and its glory  </p>
<p><strong>Cardiovorax</strong><br />
The problem is that Bitcoin runs like a pyramid scheme: all the extra money has to come in from the outside, from people who are suckered into buying Bitcoins at ever-increasing prices. That sort of thing is fundamentally unsustainable, so eventually there will be a collapse. At that point someone will be left holding the hot potato, while everyone who managed to turn a profit made so by exploiting the stupidity of others. The only way to make money off of Bitcoin is by being predatory and hoping that there will be a bigger fool than you.</p>
<p>So I guess it isn't terribly unlike horse racing after all.</p>

<p>What's to say, it's inflationary (but less so than any alternative), the most inconvenient thing invented so far (with the exception of all the alternatives), it's ruled by pretty much pure greed (and quite likely to make any sort of social entitlement/progressive measure impossible, much like in the old days of gold coins) and currently exists in the shape of a C hairball which nobody understands or even has bothered to read fully but nevertheless a bunch of mostly retarded neckbeards keep adding to, with hilarious if impredictable effects. Or did you have any specific questions ? </p>

What do you think about the developers frequently receiving threats by bitcoiners? Or the guild and certain developers trying to push for a centralised validation services? You have to realise that even ignoring the hilarity of the economic section of bitcoin that the technology is not made for this kind of deployment. But I'm sure you know better, how long have you even been involved in bitcoin? </p>
<p><strong>Cardiovorax</strong><br />
The difference being that there is nothing you can do with Bitcoin except own them, or sell them off for more real money with which to buy things you actually want. They matter to you because you treat them like a hard asset, not because you want to spend them on anything. That's the difference between a currency and a speculative commodity for you.</p>

<p>Bitcointalk is a collection of mostly poor, mostly uneducated, mostly bizarre folk you wouldn't have on your lawn/daughter/whatever. The various shit they do is representative of Bitcoin in the sense Jeremiah Wright is representative of xtians or Cornel West is representative of academia. Specifically about threaths... I get threatened all the time on teh Interwebs. I've never managed to care (yes I'm aware "the FBI takes internet threats very seriously", but I've never managed to care about that, either).</p>
<p>People will always try to push for centralised something or the other as long as they figure they'll have more market share of the centralised thing than they do now. As various failures are pushed aside to rot into irrelevance they're certain to try and find some sympathetic ear to enforce protectionist measures for them too (que Winklewhoever doods ranting about "regulation"). That topic is best served <a href=http://trilema.com/2013/the-future-of-bitcoin-regulation/>here</a>.</p>
<p>In short I don't think either are suprising or important.</p>

<p>Bitcoin was conceived as a prototype. This is what it was, like a model airplane you make with your son over the weekend to test out this weird theory whereby "you can fly with objects heavier than air". It's not the author's fault that at the end of the test run the prototype - instead of being discarded, as intended - was picked up as the actual working thing for which it was to be a mere prototype. In the model airplane business the dad would be well advised to knock the kid one over the head if that's what it takes preventing his trying to fly over Niagara Falls. In this particular circumstance all the guy could do is get the fuck out of Dodge.</p>
<p>That aside, it may just as well work. It's just risky as all fuck, that's all.<br />
