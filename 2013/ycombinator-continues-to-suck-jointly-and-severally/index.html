pigeons `coinbase announces they are switching business models again to improve something that they have no experience in that mtgox with the most experience doesn't like handling`
pigeons *coinlab
I confess I share the sentiment. I have no idea what the thing is to be called or what's supposed to be what. Coinlab ? Coinbase ? Coinyourmother ? What are all these things ? A casebook study in `how not to do branding`.
">i</a></sup> is another fine example of the sort of pointless nonsense they push. Originally it was supposed to be some sort of "WoW game gold for Bitcoin game gold" deal. It never went anywhere, as far as I know. Then it wanted to be a Bitcoin miner. I quote people who actually mine : </p>
<blockquote><p><strong>jcpham</strong> "I suspect that coinlab has burnt thru most of their funding without having launched any products, and are now desperately trying to get some press for another funding round before they go under."<br />
<strong>jcpham</strong> IN 2011, miners raped coinlab for 95%. When the block reward halved, we gamed their PPS until it was unprofitable. It's 2013 now. It's no longer even profitable to mine there, even with their bonus PPS. You lose money mining and their pool hashrate is literally nothing.<br />
<strong>dub</strong> I like how the glbse logo.<br />
<strong>jcpham</strong> They need to release a client that allows gpu miners to get paid. Otherwise they are dead.</p></blockquote>
<p>So that didn't work too well either, it would seem. I have no idea, I don't mine myself, but it seems to be the consensus. Now they want to be some sort of payment processor. To quote them : </p>
<blockquote><p>"coinlab-bringing-bitcoin-to-wall-street-with-mtgox-deal"</p></blockquote>
<p>The actual market remains both unconvinced and unimpressed : </p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Bugpowder</strong> Any thoughts on the coinlab story?  It's not clear from the wording that they actually ARE buying / HAVE BOUGHT mtgox's US book or they are just TRYING to buy the book and have achieved absolutely nothing.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Bugpowder the later. Not only is mtgox not selling, but who is coinbase again ?</p>
<p><strong>Bugpowder</strong> Coinlab.<br />
<strong>gigavps</strong> Bugpowder they are going to be mtgox's us broker essentially<br />
<strong>Bugpowder</strong> Are they?  Or are they just leaking some hype to a reporter with no actual deal<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Bugpowder my point is more alongthe lines, there's about five or six of other corps doing what they do. The fact that unlike the competition they have a burn rate is NOT an advantage.</p>
<p><strong>Bugpowder</strong> "The goal is to move customers’ money from overseas to Silicon Valley Bank by March 22nd." Like by starting a new way to deposit and stealing the future international wire action, or actually pulling all the existing deposits from Japan/HK to a US bank. Anyone have an interview transcript?<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Bugpowder you ever heard of something like this released other than as a joint item ?</p>
<p><strong>Bugpowder</strong> Nope.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> MtGox is silent. Nothing happened.</p>
<p><strong>Bugpowder</strong> "goal".<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Other than remarkably incompetent trade mag and remarkably incompetent coinlab pr person.</p>
<p><strong>Bugpowder</strong> "Has worked for a year to sign an exclusive long term deal."<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> I've been working for twelve years to fuck Tea Leoni.</p>
<p><strong>Bugpowder</strong> Heh. You may have enough Bitcoins to make it happen.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> I prefer working at it by now. Anyway, the way I read it a deal is not even close.</p>
<p><strong>Bugpowder</strong> I concur.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> If it were you wouldn't be pissing the OP off with statements of the kind. Prolly what happened is they finally got told to take a hike, and are trying to extract whatever from it.</p>
<p><strong>Bugpowder</strong> Looks like VC-style hype trying to create an illusion of success, hopefully leading to actual success.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> But on the negative side, if coinbase tech competence is anything like their pr ability, they'll be the next large hack. At any rate they're running out of money this year, so... meh.</p>
<p><strong>Bugpowder</strong> Coinbase ~= coinlab. Does not inspire confidence : http://blogs-images.forbes.com/jonmatonis/files/2012/10/coinlab-founders.jpg<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Not young enough ?</p>
<p><strong>Bugpowder</strong> They look dumb in the face.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Not jewish enough ?</p>
<p><strong>ThickAsThieves</strong> Too "where's my mai tai" looking.</p></blockquote>
<p>To make the story short and simple : Bitcoin is too big and the people that matter in Bitcoin are too heavy by now for half a million and a few dorks to make any sort of dent in the state of affairs. And when I say a few dorks I mean both the two dorks that imagine they're "founders" or whatever the hell and more generally the however many dorks loosely associated under the ycombinator banner. Boys, if you mattered at all you'd have done something I'd have heard of by now. Something a little more like Google and a little less like AirBnb. You haven't done it, and it's pretty much because you don't matter. No matter what the circlejerk might have been telling you, the fact of the matter is you (collectively and individually) suck. </p>
<p>To conclude : if within a few weeks' time you find yourself in the position of having to decide whether a few million dollars go to a. free drinks and garter inserts at a number of strip clubs or to b. coinbase "second round of funding", the correct business decision is certainly a. At least the strippers can actually provide an answer should anyone happen to ask "what the fuck are you doing".</p>
<p>Also, Bitcoin has been brought to Wall Street already, and a while ago. The agency doing it is called MPEx. I don't appreciate the unwarranted pretense of idiots like whoever is in charge of both Coinbase and Bitcoin Magazine. Get your bearings straight boys.</p>
<p>PS.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>pigeons</strong> Wtf does coinbase's platform have anything to do with "wall street"<br />
<strong>pigeons</strong> *coinlab<br />
<strong>dub</strong> It's in amurica.<br />
<strong>BitHub</strong> I smell a wallstreet fail.<br />

						<p>@<b>Curious Onlooker</b> This discussion possibly explains it best :</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>pigeons</strong> coinlab used to say they had "lots" of hpc clients lined up for gpu mininers work, anytime i tried to get details the answer was "lots of people pay for password cracking" and that work obviously never showed up so i question their honesty as well<br />
* sgornick has quit (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)<br />
<strong>splnkr</strong> i'd say the real question isn't whether coinlab can deliver but whether wall street will bite<br />
<strong>jcpham</strong> <a href="http://coinlab.com/liquidity">http://coinlab.com/liquidity</a><br />
<strong>jcpham</strong> wtf is this website<br />
<strong>pigeons</strong> yeah they are offering tools no one wants or needs<br />
<strong>ThickAsThieves</strong> they removed the Buy $1m bitcoins buttons<br />
<strong>jcpham</strong> coinlab.com used to point to some funky WURM online game<br />
<strong>jcpham</strong> Give us a call at 855-Lab-Coin or drop us a line to ask us about:<br />
<strong>jcpham</strong> Foreign Exchange Liquidity Provision<br />
<strong>jcpham</strong> Large Transactions<br />
<strong>jcpham</strong> Custom Orders / Standing Orders<br />
<strong>jcpham</strong> Full-Service Support for Family and Institutional Wealth<br />
<strong>jcpham</strong> goddamnit you motherfuckers coinlab<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> pigeons there's more good reason to question their honesty<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> loads of little things cropping up, like the habit of cancelling trades when price goes up then paying off those who throw a stink on forum</p>
<p><strong>pigeons</strong> mircea_popescu: that's coinbase<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> there's a difference ?</p>
<p><strong>Bicknellski</strong> Mt. Gox really wants to be 100% out of the US/Canada market.<br />
<strong>pigeons</strong> yes coinbase is the ycombinator/pgraham one<br />
<strong>pigeons</strong> coinbase is a gox front end with extra fees and extra problems<br />
<strong>ThickAsThieves</strong> this is a sad twitter account<br />
<strong>ThickAsThieves</strong> 210 followers<br />
<strong>pigeons</strong> coinlab is a former mining pool that overpaid so they could keep users for when they got non bitcoin hashing work that never showed up<br />
<strong>ThickAsThieves</strong> theyu follow SatoshiDice<br />
<strong>leotreasure</strong> asicmining divs are out<br />
<strong>pigeons</strong> coinbase was giving out .1 btc for account refferals when they started and was gonna implement a big pyramid scheme but the rising price killed that<br />
<strong>Diablo-D3</strong> did asicminer just push out the real dividend?<br />
<strong>leotreasure</strong> yep :D<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> pigeons you said coinbase twice.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> i am confused.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> isn't coinlab run by the same people who run coinbase ?</p>
<p><strong>pigeons</strong> no<br />
<strong>pigeons</strong> today i have been using coinbase to refer to coinbase and coinlab to refer oinlab<br />
<strong>pigeons</strong> yesterday i was not so accurate<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Diablo-D3 so have they scrapped their exchange or wtf are they doing ?<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> who's coinlab then ?</p>

<p><strong>pigeons</strong> i'm kidding about what?<br />
<strong>Diablo-D3</strong> mircea_popescu: I hate TC, honestly<br />
<strong>Diablo-D3</strong> they report news like shit<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> pigeons vessenes is ycombinator.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> the two ventures are in no way distinct.</p>
<p><strong>Diablo-D3</strong> y combinator is a group of VCs, btw<br />
<strong>Diablo-D3</strong> theres a few y combinator VCs that represent VC companies<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> no.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> ycombinator is a team of dorks.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> the vcs that get sucked in are usually innocent</p>
<p><strong>splnkr</strong> well, dorks backed by vc<br />
<strong>splnkr</strong> everyone's right<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> yeah, everytime they can be fooled into it.</p>
<p><strong>Diablo-D3</strong> mircea_popescu: ycombinator isnt a team of dorks<br />
<strong>Diablo-D3</strong> I think they invest rather too readily, though<br />
<strong>jcpham</strong> me too<br />
<strong>Diablo-D3</strong> actually, maybe thats not it<br />
<strong>Diablo-D3</strong> they invest too much too readily<br />
<strong>jcpham</strong> vc techno-fanbois<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> jcpham nothing wrong with throwing money around in principle</p>
<p><strong>Diablo-D3</strong> its okay to invest small amounts in iffy ventures if you're hedging bets<br />
<strong>splnkr</strong> perhaps narrowly is the word<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> if you're sitting on a few bn, it makes sense to peel the odd million to aggitated kids.</p>
<p><strong>Diablo-D3</strong> they want to invest in the next google<br />
<strong>Diablo-D3</strong> instead, they get the next yahoo<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> you never know when you need a cock sucked.</p>
<p><strong>splnkr</strong> well, honestly, the vc game is like that by nature. you can't predict the future. you have to place a bunch of bets and hope one hits it big<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> exactly.</p>
<p><strong>splnkr</strong> like the hollywood box office model<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> which is why i say, teh vcs are mostly innocent</p>
<p><strong>Diablo-D3</strong> splnkr: actually, I _can_ predict the future<br />
<strong>pigeons</strong> thanks i thought they were distinct. the combination lowers my esteem for both of them<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> but the sort of shit ycombinator pushes is horrible.</p>
<p><strong>splnkr</strong> Diablo-D3: don't be wasting your time here then!<br />
<strong>blu3gr1f1on</strong> like coinbase?<br />
<strong>Diablo-D3</strong> splnkr: that isnt it<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> blu3gr1f1on like airbnb<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> which is what soured me on them entirely.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> coupla years ago i was living with a generally good opinion of them and graham</p>
<p><strong>splnkr</strong> what do you mean then<br />
<strong>Diablo-D3</strong> if I understand the business plan, if I meet the founders and drill the shit out of them and they pass, and if the market they're going into is a logical choice<br />
<strong>Diablo-D3</strong> then its a sure winner<br />
<strong>Diablo-D3</strong> the problem is<br />
<strong>Diablo-D3</strong> _thats incredibly rare_<br />
<strong>splnkr</strong> but if your business model is venture capital investment, don't you have to play your cards even in the absence of those rare cases?<br />
<strong>Diablo-D3</strong> splnkr: nope.<br />
<strong>splnkr</strong> then it's throwing darts with the best available along those parameters<br />
<strong>Diablo-D3</strong> thats where they get their game wrong<br />
<strong>Diablo-D3</strong> like, okay, lets take apple<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> splnkr that's a fine way to bleed equity.</p>
<p><strong>Diablo-D3</strong> its not the example I want but it works<br />
<strong>Diablo-D3</strong> apple does three things<br />
<strong>Diablo-D3</strong> they build products, they sell a service, and they also invest<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> in general banking goes bust when the sort of managers that think "we have to play" rise to the top.</p>
<p><strong>splnkr</strong> well this is what i see happening mircea_popescu<br />
<strong>Diablo-D3</strong> apple has a huge fucking investment department<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> that sort of managers are shit.</p>
<p><strong>Diablo-D3</strong> they are now being sued because they are, according to shareholders, "hoarding cash"<br />
<strong>Diablo-D3</strong> I hope apple wins, btw<br />
<strong>Diablo-D3</strong> apple is waiting for that one perfect deal and they want to buy it<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Diablo-D3 a company that large is always going to have activist shareholders going at it.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> usually multiple groups.</p>
<p><strong>Diablo-D3</strong> mircea_popescu: yeah, but this is big enough to make the financial news<br />
<strong>splnkr</strong> yeah i say good for apple for having so much cash<br />
<strong>Diablo-D3</strong> a lot of major corporate investors are running this one<br />
<strong>pigeons</strong> zipbit is the patrickharnett/jonathan ryan owens scam right?<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> it doesn't often get reported (this wouldn't have except the "cash hoarding" bs meets the community aggenda of the current white house)</p>
<p>* nOgAnOo t0ke<br />
<strong>pigeons</strong> <a href="http://coinlab.com/strategy">http://coinlab.com/strategy</a><br />
<strong>splnkr</strong> and not debt leveraging themselves into oblivion<br />
<strong>Diablo-D3</strong> apple, as a business, is ran well<br />
<strong>Diablo-D3</strong> I dont agree with them on a lot of _technical_ issues<br />
<strong>Diablo-D3</strong> but steve jobs left behind a very competent executive staff<br />
<strong>pigeons</strong> wait zipbit is the patrick harnett/jonathan ryan owens/kimdotcom scam<br />
<strong>pigeons</strong> they are one of coinlab's 3 customers<br />
<strong>Diablo-D3</strong> so I dunno<br />
<strong>Diablo-D3</strong> I agree with mircea_popescu's wording of that though<br />
<strong>Diablo-D3</strong> its stupid to bleed capital<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> pigeons they mean bitcoini caca consultancy don't they</p>
<p><strong>pigeons</strong> wow looking at all these partners and startups, i guess all i need is twitter bootstrap and im a startup</p></blockquote>
