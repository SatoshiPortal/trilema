<p>There aren't that many Romanian entertainers worth the mention that lived in the past century or so, and most of them are Greek anyway.<sup><a href="#footnote_0_50033" id="identifier_0_50033" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This isn't factually correct, it's just that twenty years of Russian occupation followed by thirty years of dominance by the scum they left behind led to a very peculiar situation whereby the actual Romanian entertainers rejected communism and so were rejected by communism and so weren't particularly pushed (in the sense that you could get a jail sentence for playing them publicly), and then the scum the Russians left behind tried to create `national` (which practically translated to ethnically Romanian) everything even at the cost of inferior quality (which is the necessary result of imposing extraneous constraints) and finally at the collapse of that misadventure the now free Romanians had half a century of bad models and complete ignorance as to the good models before the gap, so they limited themselves to copying American crap, as if anyone gives two shits for rock&#038;roll.
And as to the `scum the Russians left behind part` : 
When a country doesn’t develop a commercial middle class, industrial technologies, a strong military, and strong institutions, it is particularly vulnerable to a certain form of theft that I call “extraction”. This is when a bunch of foreigners land on your shores, buy up some local chiefs, chop down your forests, rip the minerals out of your soil, enslave a few generations, and eventually go home, leaving their bastards in charge.
The sad part, of course, was that Romania cca 1930 did have a commercial middle class, industrial technologies and quite a strong military. It was nevertheless vulnerable to its peculiar history : in WW1 it had allied with France and England, and got mowed down by the Germans while the French and English touched wieners. As WW2 was starting it didn't judge it can remain neutral, as holders of Europe's largest oil reserves at the time, and not particularly desirous of a rehash of the Mackensen invasion they allied with the Germans. Because what the fuck's one to do, seriously now. 
And so in WW1 the Russian `allies` deserted our front, but that's okay, 'cause they're Russians, and for their services they got to keep Romania's treasury at the time (100 tons of gold of which 95% historical coins, including plenty of Roman issue, plus commercial paper by the trainload). Then in WW2 the Romanian army kicked butt all the way to Stalingrad, which apparently isn't good sportsmanship, and the faggoty Brits insisted they get Greece even at the cost of Romania, because god forbid the Oxford fancyboys get separated from the historical inventors of that sweet sweet love that dares not speak its name and an Englishman could not do without. ">i</a></sup> Jean Moscopol is a fine example in this vein. </p>
<p>He is noteworthy for having introduced the tango to Romania, with quite splendid effects<sup><a href="#footnote_1_50033" id="identifier_1_50033" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Rock &#038; roll `dancing` is for ugly women. Nicely figured Romanian girls look much better doing the tango. It's a fact.">ii</a></sup>, and his artistic acumen and large fan base allowed RCA its first forays into the Romanian market. He left Romania cca 1945 because frankly speaking by then only the poor &#038; the idiots remained (admitting for the sake of argument these are distinct categories), tried a while to get Radio Free Europe going<sup><a href="#footnote_2_50033" id="identifier_2_50033" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The communist secret service has him mentioned in 1958-59 for an enmitous relationship with Bernard Noel (whom he equates to Israil Bercovici, an ardent communist meanwhile forgotten), and generally for a displeasure with RFE's inclination to push the political agenda of its masters rather than give voice to the actual Romanian political emigration.">iii</a></sup> and eventually died in 1980, after thirty some years of waiting for the absurd regime to croak already. The absurd regime did finally croak, not a decade later, and in this he reminds me of a great-grandfather who I've actually had the pleasure of meeting. He had been a Liberal Party mayor before the war, and then spent his remaining years waiting for the Americans to come. They never did, and eventually in the mid 80s he had enough of the shit, got into bed and stopped eating.<sup><a href="#footnote_3_50033" id="identifier_3_50033" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Which, incidentally, is an age old population control mechanism, at least in Central Europe. Old enough peasant folk just stop eating when they're done and that's that.">iv</a></sup> He was dead two weeks later, aged ninety-something.</p>
<p>The moral I personally derive from these stories is that it makes no difference how well anchored evil is in the world, croak it shall - no matter what ; and further, that it makes no difference just how convincing or convenient redefining evil into something else may sound in that context, it should never be done. And in this vein, if the US Government wants its citizenry to do or not do something, it will have to ask them, nicely or otherwise. This business where it asks a foreign to not let American citizens engage in this or that activity, or where it asks a foreign to report on what activities American citizens engage in is wishful thinking of the "you've been smoking a lot of crack?" variety.</p>
<p>And now, let's move on to some very illustrative political couplets this guy left us :</p>
<blockquote><p>Ce frumoasa este viata, cind esti chior si prost ca tata,<br />

<p>As you can see, not exactly friendly. Certainly in marked contrast to the much more polite mainstream at the time, and an excellent reason to suspect the polite <em>ex officio</em>, in all times and in all places. Using language that has nothing to hide, including the puss and the stupidity of middle-aged women, is in all circumstances a more direct path to the truth of any matter than the more palatable versions of pared down language. </p>

An election means choosing when you have what to choose, but in the communist rendition you're to choose when there's nothing to be chosen. This is how all communists are, great knaves, con men and thieves. Thieves in deeds and thieves in agreements, thieves in the press and thieves in elections.</ul>
<p>Remarkably enough, the complaint of American electors is more and more markedly the observation that there's nothing to choose. </p>

<p>The Romanian society of the time was organised in a manner I find both very adequate and very comfortable, but which is meanwhile squarely unfashionable. The public/private divide present in most agrarian societies was maintained, with the man ruler of the matters outside and the woman ruler of the matters inside the threshold. Part of the entire system, the man would naturally instruct the woman as to her correct attitudes to outside points of interest, going as far as to direct her affections. As incredible as this point may sound to you, generations of women loved and hated things and peoples on the grounds that their lord and sovereign so ordered things be loved or hated. Conversely, generations of men liked dishes and disliked dishes on the grounds of what their mother cooked and didn't cook<sup><a href="#footnote_16_50033" id="identifier_16_50033" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Which reminds me of an old joke : some guy marries a woman that happens to be an excellent cook. She cooks for him, and he generally thinks her cooking is okay, but, alas... not quite like at his mother's house. (Obviously in Romania the supreme superlative for any cooking is it being `like in one's mother's house, and this to the degree various commercial products use that expression in advertising today even.) The woman is distraught with this, and for a while makes a point of trying everything she can think of, with no success. Eventually, defeated, she finds other things to occupy herself with, and as luck has it one day she forgets the pot on the fire and it burns a little. Rather than throw it all away she decides to serve the pieces, and the husband's face lights up : This is wonderful! Just like at his mother's house!">xvii</a></sup>, and the same went of clothes and so on.</p>

If you wish master that tomorrow we all eat bread, don't give up one single kernel.</ul>
<p>This is the equivalent for the foregoing, with the master of the house inquiring of the woman as to the course. She has a voice in it because the grain supplies, while produced on the outside, are what the household is supported on. Grain is an ambiguous item in the village economy, as it serves both as currency (though not quite to the degree <em>koku</em> works in Japan for instance) which makes it the empire of the man, as well as a food item, which makes it the empire of the woman. The form of the song seems to propose that the woman's role in the decision making process on the topic at hand is purely consultative, so as to satisfy particular theoretical requirements, but this formalism belies the quite opposite reality, and this tension is one of the sources of the song's humor, if not necessarily consciously noted by the audience.</p>

The sovrom-government is incredibly clever if they actually believe the refugees hearing of this amnesty are about to flock back, being totally insensate as to return and fall in the trap. The sovrom-state that lies to us should remember of Romanians that they'll gladly come once their brothers left behind are no longer behind bars and the oppressive Russians calling themselves liberators will be the ones demanding an amnesty.</ul>
<p>This is historically accurate, the "sovrom-state" did atempt this trick to at least stem the tidal wave of expatriation if not actually attract anyone back. Nobody returned.</p>

After you cash their checks and become a party to crimes, you're stuck in prison and then convicted for treason. The wheel of the world spins and each crime is paid, communism helps you at first and then kills you. So after Reich and Slavsky, Stalin killed Slansky, and Malenkov did in Beria so he'd no further molest him with the brush. After Beria Malenko took care of Abakumov, then came Khruschev and wiped Malenkov. The wheel of the world etc. When the soviet committee asks for your self-characterisation it's a plain sign they no longer like you and it'll soon be the case for self-criticism<sup><a href="#footnote_27_50033" id="identifier_27_50033" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="A particularly offensive instrument of Soviet behavioural control, especially effectual when applied to the spineless scum.">xxviii</a></sup>. After they find something the next step is the party van and then the story ends in an autopsy. Roata etc.</ul>
<p>This is quite factually correct. Then again, it was the case during the twilight years of the Roman state, too. </p>

<ul>Justinian known as Marina is the most faithful christian, he goes about like a hot stud in a limo and bows towards the Kremlin. He names himself a patriarch and the church headman, and to crown it all he's turning red<sup><a href="#footnote_31_50033" id="identifier_31_50033" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Perhaps rosacea.">xxxii</a></sup>, because he's a soviet-patriarch. Just like him, the head of the Moldavian clergy, he claims to be Rusal, the hypocrite, but he's really Russian. Just like Marina he didn't blush for a second when claiming that Romania is now independent. Forgive lord the entire flock of sellouts and sinners, just like the turk its gun<sup><a href="#footnote_32_50033" id="identifier_32_50033" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Romanian proverb, sort of `Apple doesn't fall far from the tree`.">xxxiii</a></sup>, and equally so faithfull they are. When the soviets order they cut the devil in parts and pour tons of lies to ingratiate themselves. Good lord take pity on your Romanian flock and stick the fist in the mouth of the unbelieving patriarch. He's Marina, and so should he lie make him a seaman and send him right to the bottom.</ul>
<p>Just like the Catholic church proudly carries the indelible stain of having well collaborated with the fascist and nazist regimes, a natural continuation of its collaborationist history dating back at least fifteen centuries, the Orthodox church carries exactly the same. In fact an excellent argument against in any way supporting any church irrespective of one's faith comes exactly from this well known and well documented tendency of any church to support whatever political wind blows at that time.

<p>This thing is remarkable because it's sung in no less than six different accents, doing a pretty credible Khruschev, two tones for Gheorghiu-Dej (a bored and haughty style talking to the underlyings and a very perky and serviable style talking to the Russian), and three anonymous interlocutories of which the third speaks in a very strong Moldavian accent and so is quite recognisable. The craft with which the Moldavian accent as spoken by a Romanian is distinguishable from the Romanian-as-if-it-were-spoken by Khurscev impresses. </p>
<p>Anyway, that was the man, those were the times, so it went.</p>
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<ol class="footnotes"><li id="footnote_0_50033" class="footnote">This isn't factually correct, it's just that twenty years of Russian occupation followed by thirty years of dominance by the scum they left behind led to a very peculiar situation whereby the actual Romanian entertainers rejected communism and so were rejected by communism and so weren't particularly pushed (in the sense that you could get a jail sentence for playing them publicly), and then the scum the Russians left behind tried to create "national" (which practically translated to ethnically Romanian) everything even at the cost of inferior quality (which is the necessary result of imposing extraneous constraints) and finally at the collapse of that misadventure the now free Romanians had half a century of bad models and complete ignorance as to the good models before the gap, so they limited themselves to copying American crap, as if anyone gives two shits for rock&#038;roll.</p>
<p>And as to the "scum the Russians left behind part" : </p>
<blockquote><p>When a country doesn’t develop a commercial middle class, industrial technologies, a strong military, and strong institutions, it is particularly vulnerable to a certain form of theft that I call “extraction”. This is when a bunch of foreigners land on your shores, buy up some local chiefs, chop down your forests, rip the minerals out of your soil, enslave a few generations, and eventually go home, leaving their bastards in charge.</p></blockquote>
<p>The sad part, of course, was that Romania cca 1930 did have a commercial middle class, industrial technologies and quite a strong military. It was nevertheless vulnerable to its peculiar history : in WW1 it had allied with France and England, and got mowed down by the Germans while the French and English touched wieners. As WW2 was starting it didn't judge it can remain neutral, as holders of Europe's largest oil reserves at the time, and not particularly desirous of a rehash of the Mackensen invasion they allied with the Germans. Because what the fuck's one to do, seriously now. </p>
<p>And so in WW1 the Russian "allies" deserted our front, but that's okay, 'cause they're Russians, and for their services they got to keep Romania's treasury at the time (100 tons of gold of which 95% historical coins, including plenty of Roman issue, plus commercial paper by the trainload). Then in WW2 the Romanian army kicked butt all the way to Stalingrad, which apparently isn't good sportsmanship, and the faggoty Brits insisted they get Greece even at the cost of Romania, because god forbid the Oxford fancyboys get separated from the historical inventors of that sweet sweet love that dares not speak its name and an Englishman could not do without.
