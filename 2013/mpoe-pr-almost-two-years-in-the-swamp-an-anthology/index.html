<blockquote><blockquote>Quote: misterbigg, May 28, 2013</p>
<p>I think it's worth singling out this post and bringing it to everyone's attention because not only does it speak to the character of MPOE-PR but it also shows that not everything coming from this persona is accurate (although to be fair shim has been right about a few things, like Coinlab).</p>
<p>I am not an employee of OpenCoin nor have I been paid or compensated to talk or do anything related to Ripple. It's interesting how I get called a shill, while certain bad actors are paying newbies to shill for anti-Ripple. It is true that I am the author of BearShare, but iMesh took it over a long time ago. Anything having to do with the RIAA getting details of the BearShare users has nothing to do with me.</p>
<p>I must vigorously disagree that I am "made out of shit." Quite the contrary if anyone is "made out of shit" I think it is probably MPOE-PR although this a matter of opinion. It seems he resorts mostly to ad hominems, or worse name calling. Compare and contrast the content of my posts where I try to present facts in a calm and concise manner, versus the other guy's which routinely resort to name calling, slander, and disinformation.</p>
<p>Far from being "against Bitcoin" or wanting Ripple to "destroy Bitcoin" I am bullish on both: I hold most of my net worth in Bitcoin and XRP in equal amounts. My feeling is that Ripple and Bitcoin are complementary with each having their own strengths. I'm also a contributor to both the Bitcoin repository as well as the Ripple repository. Interesting that when I look through the commit log of either, I see nothing from either MPOE-PR or his puppet master.</p>
<p>I've had lots of experience with forum trolls (the BearShare forums were raunchy!) and when I read anything from MPOE-PR, I just mentally note that everything written is "for entertainment purposes only." Perhaps someday, hot air will be a viable source of alternative energy but until then MPOE-PR will remain delegated to the dust-bin of irrelevance.</p></blockquote>
<p>So basically, you made a fake torrent piece of spyware, but it's not true that you made a fake torrent piece of spyware, and you're a shill but you're not a shill, and more words and even pictures. Well done. Your protest doth not convince. Carry on.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Ripple: Facilitating business and innovation in ways Bitcoin can't.<br />
IMHO Bigg makes a fair point when he says: " I contribute, while all MPOE does is say bullshit " (I'm paraphrasing).<br />
I have a sneaking suspicion TradeFortress, MPOE, and some of the major Ripple detractors may be working in Ripple's favour. Their impact on these forums is may really be a net positive for Ripple, since Katz and Co. clearly have the ability to respond to any questions or legitimate criticisms, and are open to debating Ripple's features.</p>
<p>As a user and entrepreneur who is still fairly new to these modern payment solutions, it's very easy for me to be supportive of Ripple. Meanwhile MPOE and his/her ilk are diminishing my like for Bitcoin ttytt.</p></blockquote>

This value should be in the interval [0, infinity), because no matter how small X is, there's still an infinity of idiots. 
And now : the reason you can't have nice things is because the 2nd value is much too close to X and the 3rd value much to close to 0. The day the 2nd value is close to 0 and the 3rd value is close to infinity, you can have nice things.

I had talked with the owner many times and he was quite nice but then to close the site down without warning, not respond to my emails, and then to offer that I split the escrow and take a half loss on an empty box, the new owner will need to be very great.

<blockquote><p>Which brings to the fore the following issue: two Chinese brothers were born the same day. One, AbelMiner, came to the community, took 20k BTC worth of equity which was called equity, built miners, faced all sorts of challenges, troubles and problems but eventually got about 6 Gh online. The other, Caivalon, came to the community, took 20k BTC worth of equity which was called "pre-orders", built miners, faced all sorts of challenges, troubles and problems but eventually delivered about 6 Gh worth of units to shareholders and then walked away from the deal under the guise of a broken pricing model. </p>
<p>Granted, this isn't quite as much of a scam as BFL. It's more of a scam than Asicminer (at least so far) and I would say on the scale these things are normally judged it counts as a scam. That the sheeple aren't quite immediately aware this is the case...well...this is how Bitcoin mining "ventures" go, isn't it? Gigavps launched bonds, paid 3-40 cents to the coin to date (but you can dilute that if you wish to "upgrade", of course); hashking launched "investments", paid 30 cents or less; amazingrando idem, this is the story since day one.</p>

<blockquote><p>Far as I can see, you're here to scam. The reasons are quite simply: </p>
<p>1. You're nobody, I couldn't tell you from Adam. Tytus, what's that. Wot? The cost to make you, entirely, is about fiddy cent. (Sure, you may or may not be related to Leszek Rychlewski, who'd be a moderately cited biology researcher. On the strength of your presentation that connection is not worth investigating.)</p>
<p>2. You came up with what you call an exchange, for no apparent reason. It doesn't exchange anything. The worthless assurances of some Marshall Islands shell "repaying" anyone for anything are of no value and no interest. </p>
<p>3. You came up with a scam for that exchange, specifically, an imaginary set of 1000 boards that Tom was selling you (in spite of bASIC not making that many boards to begin with and you not being anywhere on the lists of people that ordered). </p>
<p>I did point out to you then you're lying through your teeth, and your response was that *I* should check up on your claims. No receipts, no proof of anything. You could be Inaba if we didn't already have an idiot by that name around. </p>
<p>Conveniently enough for you Tom blew up, and so you're roughly in the situation of the various scammers operating out of GLBSE: they get to pretend like it was all Nefario's fault. Oh, yes, I forgot, you lost a million dollars with the bASIC blow-up, how fortunate for us that you're so cavalier about that disaster, picked yourself up and are back for more. Innit easy to get through due diligence for imaginary fortunes and imaginary investments? How strange that Tom never had half that much money to refund in the first place.</p>
<p>4. You came up with a slightly larger piece of bs. Who is bitfury? Oh, wait, nevermind, "BitFury Group facilitating development of BitCoin-related software, hardware and services". Great. They made a splash last summer with their insane "licensing" deal. Meanwhile they draw 7MW per Gh or something like that, and nobody (including the manufacturer) even knows what the units cost. Let alone that there were a grand total of two units built overall, during the entire 10 month lifetime of the project. As a bonus, MegaBigPower.com is some bs site registered two weeks ago, in no position to "operate" anything whatsoever. To make it perfectly clear: 100 TH made out of bitfuries is much like an aircraft carrier made out of old refurbished Ford Model Ts: not seaworthy.</p>
<p>5. If you think that is a business plan you have absolutely never either seen one or done business. </p>
<p>I get that you think Bitcoiners are idiots, and most are. The important point is that those who are have no BTC, and those who still have BTC aren't idiots. Your deluded notions that anyone will actually put as much as fifty dollars into this patent nonsense is about as amusing as the idiocy coming from the bitfinex corner. I get that you think you can buddy-buddy and "act professional" and it'll wash like it has in the past. You're wrong. It won't. </p>

<p>You Intersangro/Bitcoin Consultancy/Bitcoinica people are pretty fucking stupid, we all know that.

The trio should be under interdict, and everyone should stick to that interdict.

<blockquote><p>Scenario. </p>
<p>I. Buy, borrow or steal 1k btc. </p>
<p>II. Open Krakken Bank of Bitcoin, October 1st (as we all know krakken eat pirates). Offer 7% per week to investors. At this point it makes sense strategically to open it only to "selected" investors - most everybody isn't interested anyway so you gain some "mystique" that costs nothing. </p>
<p>III. 1st of November. Collected a few hundred in principal, paid maybe 10-20 BTCs from your 1k. BuKK stands at a few hundred btc invested + the goodwill of paid investors, you stand at ~980 BTC.</p>
<p>IV. 1st of December. Collected about 1k BTC in principal, paid ~200 BTC from your 1k. BuKK stands at 1k invested, buzz is starting to fly. You're ~750 BTC.</p>
<p>V. 1st of January. Collected 2-3k BTC, paid pretty much the remainder of your original balance. Start making little noises here and there about how you "own" the bitcoin market and delicately suggest to people that your moves actually have any impact (a ludicrous concept, but it served the bankers of old fiat well). </p>
<p>VI. 1st of February. Things start to balloon from here. BuKK principal is easily over 10k BTC, growth rates in the 10 to 20% range each week. Replenish your original 1k with some fringe just in case, pay the suckers their "interest" from the growth rate like any serious pirate/krakken/anything else designed-to-fail ponzi scheme. Do a lot of mouthing about imaginary investment opportunities irl or at the irl/btc interface that somehow magically net you what no business in the ~1000 years of business history ever made and each hyip in the ~10000 years of hyip history always claimed.</p>

<blockquote><p>The only reason I gave this scheme any credibility whatsoever was the fact that a lot of generally intelligent and (apparently at least ) even honest long timers on this forum gave it not only the benefit of the doubt, but full credibility. Many of them did know more than I did, because they met Pirate, because some at least claimed to know and understand his business model.  People who I assume to be smart enough to recognize a ponzi when staring at one this obvious. If they were totally convinced it wasn't one, what was it they knew that I did not?</p>
<p>This is still true today, perhaps even more so than 6 months ago. IF 6 months ago, I was 95% sure  it was a ponzi, right now, ironically,  I am *less * sure . Why ? Because these same, generally intelligent people  dont seem to be thrown off one bit, despite the fact that it looks like a ponzi now more than anything ever could.  Because I dont believe Matthew, crazy as he may be, is actually stupid enough or can even afford to bet $1M on something he wouldnt be sure off or doesnt  understand himself.  Because none of those big Pirate backers are getting out their pitchforks. In fact most of them are still tacitly supporting him.</p>
<p>There are not so many explications for this. Either it is not a ponzi and somehow Pirate will pay up, crazy as that may sound to anyone who has no more information than I have.</p>
<p>Or if it is a ponzi, then the vast majority of pirate backers were given an incentive to pretend to believe him. I might believe Goat is stupid enough to be fooled  by pirate, but I will not believe that from most of the others. IOW, if this unfolds like it appears it will,  they would be knowing accomplices.

<blockquote><blockquote>Kluge, September 30, 2012<br />
Effective immediately,</p>
<p>I am defaulting on my BDK.BND debt. Beyond this, I will no longer be honoring the contract in the form I originally laid out. I previously intended to empty my non-legal wife's (we personally consider ourselves married, but legally, we are individual and thus have rights we'd otherwise forfeit) 401(k). I obviously did not want to do this, but it became clear it was necessary as I was looking at $200-250/wk interest on this single debt while having been financially raped by loans to various members of the community (No, Pirate is not the primary cause of my distress. Please don't turn this into some Pirate discussion.). After weeks of tha stress, on top of previous stress... heated arguments... -- this is no longer an option. I do not think her response to my actions is unreasonable (she's already effectively lost tens of thousands due to my actions), but this clearly affects my ability to repay within what I'd consider a reasonable time-frame. I currently have a negative net worth excluding my residence which would be protected under a personal bankruptcy filing which I will not pursue unless a suit is formally filed against me. I'd advise against taking action on potential cynicism, and suggest you give me at least a couple months to confirm I am indeed making a decent effort toward repaying what I owe.</p>
<p>I am unable to pay interest on my current BDK.BND debt. It's impossible for me to keep up with that, living expenses, and interest on other debts which are small enough where I can close them - and I apologize, in a sense, for the unfairness of how this is being handled. BDK.BND-holders, who I've always wanted most protected from risk, are now getting the shaft. I cannot subject my wife to more loss, and will be forcing BDK.BND holders to suffer as a result of my unwillingness to liquidate my residence. I apologize for the trust I've violated, the business mismanagement, and this default as a result. If I were unable to compartmentalize, I would be unable to write this. I am truly and deeply sorry. I also apologize for not having the emotional fortitude to prevent what I'm also about to announce: I will not be communicating much, if at all. I will likely not read anything written in this thread beyond this post for months. I just can't handle it when there are many things I need to do to get the situation in order. I will not be responding to phone calls, Skype messages, nor responding to emails. I will not be clarifying what I've written, and will not be responding to questions. I just can't right now, and understand how bad that looks and is. Again, I apologize. I will post an impersonal message each time I make a dividend payment.</p>
<p>All BTC I currently own will go toward BDK.BND payments. These will come in the form of irregular, unannounced dividends -- there will no longer be .001BTC/bond dividends each week. I will never buy BDK.BND back, and that section of the contract can be considered practically void. I can do nothing but assure everyone that I have no intent to make any purchases of BDK.BND units, and will allow them to trade freely on GLBSE as people value them given I have absolutely no information on when, and in what amount, these bonds will be repaid. However, I promise I will repay the debt as it stands, as I'm able. So long as GLBSE is active, I am alive, and earning income, I will continue to make dividend payments on BDK.BND units as a gesture of goodwill (and appreciation for not suing me into bankruptcy) beyond the .101BTC "hard debt" I currently consider as existing. Basically - I will be making larger, more rapid payments until dividends beyond this date reach .101BTC/bond. After that time, I will continue paying irregular dividends in a way which is appropriate for the gratitude I owe, and possible for the amount I need to live. I am unable to provide a repayment schedule or dividend schedule. Essentially - I'm giving what I can without forcing an unreasonable amount of loss (beyond what I've currently caused) onto my non-legal wife, and I naively hope everyone trusts me to be doing exactly what I'm saying I will. I'll provide instructions in my will to give an update (with death certificate) on this forum in the event of my death. Though things have been pretty shit lately, I am not at all suicidal -- just gave the info in that last sentence as an FYI.</p>
<p>-Ben</p>
<p>(Additionally... Someone may remember I recently posted assets/liabilities on my side. This included many of my non-legal wife's assets. The CU/bank assets have been largely emptied to repay CD-holders and my mother, who fronted us money to purchase this house [I've since defaulted on that loan, too, after a partial repayment so I could repay CD-holders]. There is still one outstanding CD-holder who has been excessively generous in providing me time to repay.)</p>
<p>(Many individuals have my home address [NOT the Spring Arbor address. That is a family member's house. DO NOT release that address.]. I would prefer my home address not be released publicly, but would also not consider public release of that information unwarranted. If you are coming for a visit, I would like at least a voice message a day or two prior. Harm toward family's off-limits, and I would physically object to bodily harm which may result in my stay in a hospital, as that'd further impede repayment. I am armed, so please keep ideas of physical violence in check.)</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote>Yes, that's right, that's the sum total of your arsenal for why BFL is evil:  We are late shipping and screwed up our power estimates on our first product a year and a half ago.</p></blockquote>
<p>No, actually, the arsenal is this:</p>
<p>1. Your original CEO was a convicted felon on probation (he pleaded guilty). Being involved in BFL was in violation of the terms of his probation. Him not telling anyone about it was certainly shady. The crime for which he was convicted (upon pleading guilty) is sensibly the same thing you're doing now: taking people's money for vague promises you don't actually keep.</p>
<p>2. Upon the public discovering your CEO was a convicted felon, you tried to cover it up.</p>
<p>3. Upon the cover-up not working, the CEO/board was secretly shuffled, and then you &#038; sockpuppet bunch tried to pretend 1 never actually happened.</p>
<p>4. Your original product was a fraud, in the sense it wasn't something you developed, it was a high end, end of life product you bought on the cheap and sanded off. This was eventually discovered and publicly documented, but mum's the word from your side. This leaving to the side the fact it was late and out of spec - maybe you got lucky at the last minute and otherwise your scam would have ended last year, who knows.</p>
<p>5. Your business model, whereby you take money from idiots and call their contribution "pre-orders" when it's really equity is also fraudulent, and if you ever end up in court this will likely blow the lot of you to jail. You're not allowed to take "pre-orders" for products that at that time do not exist.</p>
<p>6. You have consistently been proven wrong about pretty much any statement involving time you made. We're counting North of a dozen occurrences by now.</p>
<p>7. Your logo is lifted off the Internet. The company registration is either bought off a bankrupt company or else an outright sham - nobody knows at this point. You make false claims of experience based on this bought off/stolen registration.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>What happened here was this: PatrickHarnett advertised a depositing scheme, recallable on demand, paying 5% a month. He then unilaterally changed the interest rate to 1% (or below that, in steps, something like that). This in itself is a breach of contract, as he wasn't also simultaneously repaying holders on demand, but we'd have let it slide.</p>
<p>Then, he converted deposits into unrecallable paying ~1% a week. So basically what PatrickHarnett has done was transform an interest bearing recallable deposit into a sort of miner bond, where he pays "some" interest and the principal can never be recovered. This is not acceptable.</p>

Huh? </p>
<p>TradeHill paid back every single one of their account holders when they shut down.</p></blockquote>
<p>No they did not. For that matter they are to this day one of the <a href=http://trilema.com/2012/the-bitcoin-drama-timeline/>largest scams</a> in BTC.</p>
<p>That people from the mostly irrelevant foundation thingie are promoting them is concerning, but only if you subscribe to the minority view that the thing carries any weight or importance. Much like the foundation's involvement in the Bitcoin Magazine theft/conversion thing, much like their appaling accounting practices on the donations collected (which apparently are chiefly used for the purpose of floating old boy's Vessenes' otherwise hopeless "business" with some emergency BTC capital), this recent propping of one of Bitcoin's largest scams/more notorious scammer's return simply serves to ruin their already tenuous reputations.</p>
<p>To be perfectly clear: Jared Kenna lied about Dwolla, ran off with a lot of money, used that money to build some real estate development (in partnership with a different set of scammers, the Jonathan Ryan Owens, Alberto Armandi, Meni Rosenfeld troop), is now back like any scammer ever trying to dig himself out of the hole with incredible cheek and pennies on the Bitcoin. </p>
<p>This won't wash, incidentally. Not only is using Tradehill plain immoral at this point, but you can be sure that as far as it can be helped any mark they ever come across with this more recent scam of theirs will be properly warned.</p>
<p>On a more general note: stop trying to scam the angel/va circuit with magical Bitcoin, all of you. It gives us a bad name in general, it won't work for you in particular. It's just NOT how success is done.</p>

<blockquote><p>I am still waiting for my funds to be returned by Tradehill #1 / Jered Kenna. About 6 months ago I sent an email to tradehill, Jered responded, confirmed my account balance and requested a BTC address so he could send the funds. I was hopeful, however he never sent the BTC funds to the address I provided him. I have sent multiple gentle 'reminder' emails to both his address and the info address.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Tradehill still has my BTC from when it first shut down. I sent them an email as soon as I found out about the shutdown, which was in April 2012.

<p>The second rehash of this scam never took off. Not because of "the community" having any sense, of course, but principally because the money people contemplating backing Kenna had the sense to ask me, and then backed off. </p>
<p>And if you don't quite readily comprehend what motivates the stuff in the middle, <a href=http://trilema.com/forum-logs-for-07-dec-2013#994756>here's a pretty decent theory</a> for you.

						<p>Just to get some facts straight:</p>
<p>1. I am not a scammer. In fact, at the risk of tooting my own horn, I'm one of the most honest and honorable people you'll find, and any reasonable person who has ever had business or other dealings with me will confirm this.</p>
<p>2. I have not been involved in any way in Jered Kenna's real estate venture. I wouldn't know if it's a scam or not, but I'm guessing it's not. Jonathan Ryan Owens was/is involved with it.</p>
<p>3. I had some regrettable business with Alberto Armandi, however I would hardly call myself part of his "troop".</p>
<p>4. I lent some money to JRO once (which he sort of repaid eventually) and I've met him once, but I had no other dealings with him. Also, JRO and AA have had a venture together, which exploded and resulted in JRO warning me against doing business with AA (which, unfortunately, I did not pay sufficient attention to).</p>

						<p>There isn't a way out for you <a href=https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=178336.msg8256533#msg8256533 >old time idiots</a> on the avenue of "self consistency", ie claiming that everything you did was okay and you're nice and good. You are not nice nor good, you are old time idiots, with so much failure imputable to you personally strung on your tails that you can never lift your head again among civilised people.</p>
<p>There <del datetime="2014-08-12T17:32:44+00:00">are</del> <a href=https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=106391.0 >were</a> occasions for you to humiliate yourselves into perhaps some sort of re-communion, but your idiocy manifested there as it universally manifested everywhere in everything you ever did : you missed that chance. Still, merely the fact that your idiocy will never be either forgotten or forgiven does not constitute license to continue pretending as if it never existed. You are simply the damned of Bitcoin, your lot is to toil endlessly and perhaps act as a living didactic material for noobs : don't be stupid like Rosenfeld, don't end up like Rosenfeld sort of thing.</p>
<p>I hope the facts are straight now, in your stupid doghead.</p>
