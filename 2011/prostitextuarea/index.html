<p>Nu, nu vom vorbi despre <a href="http://trilema.com/2010/minciuni-la-comanda/">Miruna Siminel</a>, <a href="http://trilema.com/2011/marta-usurelu-e-chiar-proasta-sau-doar-face-pe-proasta/">Marta Usurelu</a>, <a href="http://trilema.com/2010/minciunile-softcore/">Vali Perfu</a> &#038; <a href="http://trilema.com/2011/mizeria-umana/">co</a>. E un titlu chiar prea bun pentru a-l strica pe asa ceva.</p>
<p>Cautam o descriere ceva pentru niste poze de le-am urcat pe <a href="http://trilema.com//dtng/c/res/12907.html">dtng</a> (care mi se pare mie sau cam incepe sa miste, singur chan romanesc ramas pe Internet cum se gaseste el ?) cind am inventat cuvintul asta nou. El nu mai exista pina acum, nici in limba romana, nici in limba engleza, dupa cum ne asigura Google.</p>
<p>Nu-i ciudat ca nu exista ? Ar cam trebui sa existe. In limba engleza <em>prostitextuate</em> ca verb, a te prostitua textual. Sau ca substantiv, cel (si mai rar cea) care se prostitueaza textual. Un soi de prostitutie livresca, asa. A se prostitextua in limba romana. O prostitextuata de-asta ar putea fi o femeie care verifica pe propria piele teoria ca hirtia duce orice. <em>Vellum</em>-ul, pielea de juninca.</p>
<p>Ar putea fi viitorul meseriei scrisului, ca tot se plinge lumea ca dispare mirosul cartii tiparite, placerea carnala a rasfoirii paginilor. Cu siguranta e viitorul jurnalismului, aceasta fata saraca care-a tot mirosit la masa mare a literaturii universale doua sute de ani si iata ca ospatul s-a sfirsit, creditorii au dat buzna si-au inchis palatul, pina si catelele s-au retras satule si usor mahmure prin colturi sa se-ncovrige, numa' jurnalijdii amusina inca neprimiti la masa. Si mai nou neprimibili la masa, chiar admitind prin absurd ca i-ar baga cineva in seama cumva, din motivul simplu ca nu mai exista masa.</p>
<p>Ideea-mi pare ca promite, <a href="http://trilema.com/2010/domnisoare-nude-citind/">domnisoare nude citind</a> alte domnisoare, nude si ele. Circuitul textului in natura, din gura-n gura. De pe mina pe sin si din coapsa-n pleoapa. Din lorgean-n-geana. Va dati seama cita antropologie incape aici (din lipsa de altceva mai adecvat, bineinteles) ? </p>
<p>Cred ca-i o idee absolut geniala, sincer va spun. Oare pe cite fete ar incapea Sonetele ? Oare <em>stat pristina</em>, numa' <em>nomina nuda</em> ? </p>

						<p>An attempt at translation:</p>
<p>No, we won't talk about Miruna Siminel, Marta Usurelu, Vali Perfu &amp; co. This is just way too good to spoil it.</p>
<p>I am looking for something as a description for some pictures I got on dtng (of which I find thousands or start moving, one chan stuck on Romanian Internetz as found it?) When I made that word again. It did not exist until now, neither in Romanian nor English, as we are provided by Google.</p>
<p>It is strange that it didn't? It ought to have. Prostitextuate as a verb in English is to literally prostitute yourself. Or as a noun, the man (and rarely woman) who prostitute in a literary manner. So this is a bookish sort of prostitution. It is prostitextua in Romanian. A prostitextuata -this could be a woman who checks the hard theory that anything can lead a paper. Vellum the skin of heifers.</p>
<p>This could be the future job of writing as the whole world complains the smell of printed books is disapearing, the carnal pleasure of browsing pages. It's definitely the future of journalism, this poor girl who has everything smelled a great literary table set two hundred years ago and with this the feast was over, the creditors have stormed and the palace is closed, even the bitches were fed up and retired to the corners slightly hung over to dry, only journalists still not received at the table remain sniffing. And again not received at the table, even admitting the absurdity that someone would put out something for them for the reason that there is no table.</p>
<p>The idea seems to promising to me, nude ladies reading other nude ladies. Cyclic text in nature, from the mouth in to the mouth. From the hand to the breast and thigh on to the eyelid. From ass to eyelash. You do realize what anthropology quote fits here (for lack of anything more appropriate, of course)?</p>
<p>I think it's an absolutely brilliant idea, frankly. I wonder how many girls the Sonnets would fit? Really stat pristina, numa’ nomina nuda?</p>

						<p>Thanks, I missed that. Manged to catch some things on the way to this draft (at least I think, maybe I regressed). Been a long time since I've attempted a translation, but even then just Spanish in school.<br />

No, we won't talk about Miruna Siminel, Marta Usurelu, Vali Perfu &amp; co. This is just way too good a title to spoil thus.</p>

<p>It is strange that it didn't? It ought to have. Prostitextuate as a verb in English is to prostitute yourself textually. Or as a noun, the man (and rarely woman) who prostitute in a literary manner. So this is a lettered sort of prostitution. It is prostitextua in Romanian. A prostitextuata -this could be a woman who checks the hard theory that anything can lead a paper. Vellum, the skin of the heifers.</p>
<p>This could be the future job of writing as the whole world complains the smell of printed books is disappearing, the carnal pleasure of browsing pages. It's definitely the future of journalism, this poor girl who has everything smelled a great literary table set two hundred years ago and with this the feast was over, the creditors have stormed and the palace is closed, even the bitches were fed up and retired to their corners slightly hung over to dry, only journalists still not received at the table remain sniffing. And again they are not received at the table, even admitting the absurdity that someone would put out something for the reason that there simply is no longer a meal.</p>

						<p>Prostitextuation</p>
<p>No, we're not going to talk about Miruna Siminel, Marta Usurelu, Vali Perfu &amp; co. It's a too good of a title to waste on something like that.</p>
<p>While searching for a description for some pics that I uploaded on dtng (which is it just me or is it starting to take off, as the only Romanian channel left on the Internet?), I coined this word. It didn't exist up until now, neither in romanian or english, as Google assures us.</p>
<p>Isn't it weird that it doesn't exist? Because I think it should. In English, to prostitextuate (as a verb) means to verbally prostitute yourself. Or as a noun, he(and rarely she) who textually prostitutes oneself. A sort of alphabetical prostitution. In Romanian- a se prostitextua. A prostitextuate could be a woman that tests for herself the theory that paper can take anything. The Vellum, heifer skin.</p>
<p>This could be the future of the writing profession, as people complain that the smell of printed books are vanishing, the carnal pleasure of skimming through pages. Most certainly she's the future of journalism, this poor girl that kept smelling at the fastous dining table of universal literature for two hundred years. And now that the feast is over, creditors have barged in and closed the palace. Even the satiated and slightly tipsy bitches have secluded themselves, cowering in the corners. Only journalists are still sniffing at the table uninvited. And they can't be invited anymore, absurdly assuming they have been considered, simply because the dining table no longer exists.</p>
<p>Seems to me that the idea is promising- nude ladies reading other ladies, nude as well. The cycle of text in nature, from mouth to mouth. From the hand to the breast and from thigh to eyelid. From rump to eyelash. Do you realise how much anthropology fits in here (from lack of something more proper, of course)? </p>
<p>I think it's an absolutely brilliant idea, in all honesty. On how many girls would the Sonnets work?<br />
Is stat pristina, only nomina nuda</p>

<p>I was searching for a description for some pictures which were put up on dtng (which --does it only seem so to me or is it beginning to get moving, the only Romanian chan left on the internet such as it is?) when I invented this new word.

<p>Isn't it weird that it doesn't exist? It'd just about have to exist. In the English language prostitextuate as a verb, to prostitute textually. Or as a noun, he (and more rarely she) who prostitutes textually. A sort of bookish prostitution. "A se prostitextua" in Romanian.

<p>I think that it's an absolutely brilliant idea, I tell you truly. Imagine, how many girls would the Sonnets fit upon? What of the original remains, only its bare name?</p>

						<p>I would say this has gone as close as it could. Time to go <em>ex cathedra</em> : </p>
<blockquote><p>No, we’re not talking about Miruna Siminel, Marta Usurelu, Vali Perfu &#038; co. Too good a title to spoil thus.</p>
<p>I was trying to come up with a  description for some pics uploaded on dtng (speaking of which, is it me or is that thing starting to move, the only Romanian chan left on the internet such as it is?) when I came up with this new word. It didn’t exist until now, not in Romanian nor in English, as Google assures us.</p>
<p>Isn’t it weird that it wouldn’t exist? It just about has to exist. In English, prostitextuate as a verb, to prostitute yourself textually. Or as a noun, he (and more rarely she) who prostitutes themselves textually. A sort of livresque prostitution. “A se prostitextua” in Romanian. One such prostitextuate would be a woman proofing on her own skin the theory that paper carries anything. The vellum, her heifer's hide. </p>
<p>It could be the future of the profession of writing, since the world bemoans the disappearance of printed books and the carnal pleasure of flipping through pages already. Certainly it’s the future of journalism, that poor stray girl that kept sniffing around the grand halls of Universal Literature for two hundred years and looky that the feast is at an end, the creditors are breaking through and boarding up the windows, even the stray bitches have withdrawn, sated and slightly drowsy into corners to digest, only the journawhores still sniff about unwelcome at the table. Unwelcomable, by now, even if we'd absurdly entertain the notion someone'd somehow notice them, for the simple reason of lack of a table to be welcomed at.</p>
<p>The idea seems promising to me, nude mademoiselles reading up other mademoiselles, nude themselves. The circuit of text in nature, from mouth to mouth. From hand to breast and from thigh to eyelid. From ass to eyelash. Do you notice how much anthropology fits in here (for lack of something more adequate, of course)?</p>
<p>I think that it’s an absolutely brilliant idea, I tell you truly. I wonder how many girls it would take to fit the Sonnets? I wonder, stat pristina, just nomina nuda?</p></blockquote>

						<p>No, we won't talk about MS, MU, VP or so. The title is just too good to waste it on such scum.</p>
<p>I was searching for a description or smth for some pictures I posted on dtng(it's just me or it's going well despite being the last romanian chan alive on the internet, hard to find as it is?) when it occured to me this new word. It didn't existed up till now, not in Romanian, not even in English, as Google assures.</p>
<p>Isn't it weird it doesn't exist? It should. In english, prostitextuate as a verb, get paid for advertorial writing. Or as a noun, he who(rare usage) to actually prostitutes himself in writing (which is when someone pays you for writting, showing everyone how retarded you can act upon payment). Like a blogger, paid guest posts. A se prostitextua in Romanian. Such prostitextutian could be a women who would find the brute dumb way, which is on her own skin, that the owner will carry papers. Paper as in vellum, calfskin for writing.</p>
