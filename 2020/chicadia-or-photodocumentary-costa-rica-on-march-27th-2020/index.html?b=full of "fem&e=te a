<p style="text-align: right;"><strong>Motto :</strong> I've been expecting you...</p>

<p>Above &#038; below : connector and overpass on 27 (Autopista del Sol!!!) towards Sabana. It probably doesn't mean anything to you ; it is however the first time in my life, (ie, since the early 2000s) that I can shoot the asphalt here. I don't think it was this empty at any point, including when they were building it.</p>

<p>Downtown San Jose, such <em>a fucking pleasure</em> to drive these days. This is how it always should be, truly. Kill the people.</p>

<p>Above : one of the most entrenched nexi of congestion, in San Pedro right next to the UCR<sup><a href="#footnote_6_93394" id="identifier_6_93394" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Universidad de Costa Rica, the local `state` University. Quite as  full of `feminismo radical` and assorted fashionable nonsense as you'd expect from the contemporary dumbas.">vii</a></sup> campus </p>

<p>Above : Pedestrian street. The first time I took Nicole for a promenade down here she nearly threw up from motor confusion driven by her naive attempt to follow the trajectories of all the half million ticos randomly perambulating in all directions at the same time backwards. "Chicago is nothing like this", well... no shit, beotch! Nothing is nothing like this, even a beehive has some method to the madness. Excepting perhaps flyblown meat. <em>Perhaps</em>. Yet looky that now they've managed to self-organize to a degree never before conceivable. It's true that the organization rather consists of absence, but it is unarguably organisation, what can I say. I really didn't mind the pululation so much, myself.</p>
<p>Below : The park's been closed. Da fuck sense this makes is anyone's guess, but I suppose the idea behind this onslaught of the state upon civil society is that they're trying to limit the venues for popular congregation. For the sake of preserving the multitude, which civil society really has neither any interest in nor properly speaking much use for, the state's proposing to gut the very thing. What the fuck's the point of <em>there even being</em> any people if the whole idea is you're not to prop them against that tree, lift their skirt and stuff their hole ? Hm ?</p>
<p>Anyways, <em>saludos</em> to all the misfortunates stuck in Romania, India, Brazil, and pretty much everywhere else the world over except for right here. I'm sorry your lives suck these days, to some degree<sup><a href="#footnote_8_93394" id="identifier_8_93394" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Quite a notable degree, at that -- from what I hear the Romanian army is now on the streets enforcing the end of times ; whereas in Brazil the president came up with the right idea (`forget about all this prevention bullshit, the disease is worse than the cure, MP was right, we should all just listen to him instead of you supposedly scientific dumb fucks`) to which the various provincial governors came back with the self-obvious `lulz, no, we like the plebs being off our streets`. Maybe they duke it out, who knows, civil war in Brazil just as I was to visit...
Anyways, sucks to be you. But, with any luck, maybe you don't have so long to wait.">ix</a></sup>, but whenever I have coffee out with the sluts I think of you. We even talk about it. Does it do anything ?</p>

<p>Above : the <em>phones</em> have been taped "closed", because obviously they're dangerous. In the same vein, the legal proceedings over the case of some gringo who came here, married some local whore, she <a href=http://trilema.com/2017/how-to-take-control-of-your-provider-a-guide-for-whores/>ate his money</a> and then tried to move on whereupon he <a href=http://trilema.com/2012/cica-barbatii-adevarati-is-aia-care-isi-asuma/>manned up</a> and killed her were suspended because the judge noticed that they only have a single microphone, and lots of people have to be heard therefore it'd have resulted in having to pass that thing back and forth which'd have been dangerous because what if saliva droplets or somesuch.<sup><a href="#footnote_9_93394" id="identifier_9_93394" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="What sense this makes is anyone's guess, indeed latrines aren't dangerous even though all shit in the hole, but for as long as nobody sucks anything back in it's all... gravy, let's say. Who knows, maybe the way they use microphones here is different from the way they use them where they were invented, and in practice closer to the way they use dildos (where dildos were invented). Or maybe it's simply that nobody went to school, because it was closed while they were growing up. Or whatever else, not like it makes any difference to me (though it probably will, to you -- but then again... what can you do).">x</a></sup></p>
<p>Below : the <em>buses</em>, however, they're A-ok. Isn't this a wonder, how the god of virii himself whispered in the pseudoscientists' ears truths about how gel with a maximal alcohol content around 16% or so will do <em>in vivo</em> as applied by random untrained judges &#038; other street urchins the exact same offices alcohol solutions over 60% do <em>in vitro</em><sup><a href="#footnote_10_93394" id="identifier_10_93394" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I'm not going to belabour the difference between what things mean in the lab and what things mean in your daily practice, for values of `things` such as `to wash`, chiefly because it's a topic that comes after primary education which manifestly never happened, so non lieu.">xi</a></sup> and further that phones and microphones are dangerous while buses and bus lines are entirely unperilous ? </p>

<p>Above : Be all as it may, the doubleparking shall continue. I always suspected that'll be the last postmodern artifact to go away.</p>
<p>Below : On paseo de las putas, the shoe stores are mostly all closed. Dangers of infection &#038; colaboremos etcetera. The clothes stores are however mostly all open. You suppose it's because any self-respecting slut needs clothes more urgently than she needs shoes ? It seems backwards, mine are allowed to wear heels as often as they please, even to bed<sup><a href="#footnote_11_93394" id="identifier_11_93394" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Isn't it fun to fuck a chick in 8 inch stilettos, by the way ?

<p>Above : lots of lingerie stores also open ; a very nice practically-all-nude body stocking thing caught my eye (not here, towards the other end of this here p. de las p.) much to the delighted excitement of the young black men manning it (who, I suspect, rather expected they'd get a nude show out of the sale, because yes, I do have my slaves try things out, what the fuck, they come out of the dressing room and parade about the store to my satisfaction), but I didn't feel like crossing the street.

We came in, see, and one of our usual waiters, sole on the premises (something we never before saw, there's always three to four on duty) most apologetically explained that we'll have to sit apart.
