How come actual governments can only close once, but this `democracy` cancer has been rotting away human hope and human potential seemingly forever ?
As debatable as that `seemingly forever` may ring, definitively looms as a distinct possibility, at least according to a certain prophet : 
Human productivity will never recover ; 2000-something, whichever it was, marks a (likely permanent) high mark in human activity. Sure, contrary pretense may be put forth, even defended for a while. Perhaps robotization may fill the slack such that nominally Earth productivity will one day surpass that. Human productivity however never will, which is the greater point here : the relevancy of individual humans to this world, to human affairs, to human society, economy, etcetera, is gone. There was an event horizon, apparently, nobody fucking realised this, it would seem, nevertheless sometime between 2019 and 2020 it was crossed and... well, again : likely permanently. Nothing you do nenceforth (like henceforth but in the negative) matters in any substantial sense, because between fake science and very real social dissolution humanity has meanwhile lost the ability to matter in the world or mean anything to itself.

<p>Intelligent people like to tell each other that they aren't liberal or conservative but independent; that Fox and MSNBC are biased and can't be trusted, that partisanship, "special interests" and "lobbyists" have destroyed America<sup><a href="#footnote_5_95757" id="identifier_5_95757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This, combined with a very banal observation of the married woman, that it is exceedingly easy to remove political obstacles in the household by simply demanding to see the kids' report cards, produced the 1980s `libertarian party`. The thing lived essentially as a collection of middle aged, middle class, mostly white suburbia-dwelling women who, having independently noticed that recourse to accountancy wonderfully silences the kids, and the husband, proceeded to apply it to local government. As they found each other they ineffectually attempted to scale up their meager discoveries, but unfortunately for them their winds scaled on a tight logarithmic whereas the defenses of the socialist-democratic behemoth scaled on a loose exponential, and so by the mid-90s their nautical nutshell was done as a going concern (even if, nothing if not stubborn, some kept trying for a decade or thereabouts).
This, of course, was the age of gopher, and actually competent, actually skilled females in the workforce cut out of the cloth of that Admiral chick. Nowadays the same impulse produces mere Karens out of the  barely-literate, practically mongoloid Vickis of America.">vi</a></sup>; in essence, that they are not ideologues but practical, reasonable people who just want the system to do what's right. Then you ask them what exactly "right" is, and the yelling starts.</p>
<p>Intelligent people, like racists, are fluent in describing themselves in opposition to what they are not, but ask them to define themselves by what they are, tell you what they do believe in, and they're lost. They have opinions on issues, sure, but ask for an overarching ideology and their face botoxes. Overarching ideology? Only people with manifestos have ideologies, not having an ideology is the whole point of being independent, the only thing they deal in is "facts" or "reality", and gun to head if they believe in anything it's "science."<sup><a href="#footnote_6_95757" id="identifier_6_95757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The poor little frail gals -- and I know this first hand, for having been very much right fucking there, as per usual with me -- were nevertheless quite disproportionately influential, and while Ballas is right in identifying their overpowering effect upon the media, wherein pretty much everything that non-Trilema even is today entirely consists of the substance of fearing them and hating them, like everything a wolfsangel or a roundworm are is driven by the overwhelming mammal they parasitize and naught else, the contemporary wank of pseudoscientific dedication to `Science` derives from exactly the same source. It is naught but exactly that : the scab built by the body politic over the round hole these chicks' spear left in it. Except, of course, calling it `a body` tends to imply that it had other shit going on, it was otherwise engaged when pierced ; but this implication is not factual. Rather, much like once the wolves start howling in the night the blacksmith might take a scythe and beat it into the Z shape, just so once they started showing up at townhall meetings the tardsmith beat the state into the presently observable shape. Fear, and loathing, and scant else besides.
But hey, at least the pantsuited hilarity `liberated` women, you know ?">vii</a></sup> Not physics or chemistry, but evolution. You know, whatever ideologues hate.</p>
<p>I phrase it this way not to insult a group, but to show you how very easy it is to <i>brand identify</i> a group, because when a group becomes a demo it loses most of its freedom of action and becomes baa baa black sheep. Do you want to see the consequence? Turn on CNN.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>"The government shut down just shows that our government doesn't function correctly!" That's one interpretation, the other is that when a car starts to smoke, you pull over and fix it, you don't keep going 'till it explodes<sup><a href="#footnote_7_95757" id="identifier_7_95757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This, amusingly enough, is what I used to believe ; and as I believed so I did. Not anymore, though, for months now.
The problem starts when overbearing yet overarching, spuriously self-perpetuating and automatically expanding complexity (such as for instance manifested in contemporary cars, or anything else) encounters progressively less able, less active, less qualified and capable and therefore less `opressed by the violence of capitalism` and `burdened by colonialism` -- ultimately, less human humans. Like the lovable, loving schmucks befouling Costa Rica, among whom I'd have to find a car mechanic, if I seriously intend to give my pulling over any kind of fixing follow-up.
They're not capable of anything such as maintenance, you see. I'd say `here`, but (on the basis of actual experimental work) I very much doubt the problem is localized. If you're currently finding yourself in a bubble where the foregoing yet doesn't hold true, worry yourself not -- it certainly will soon enough. Frankfurt also seemed like a city, and stood like a city, for abundant centuries before the deskilling gutted it like were a rotting catfish, in what seems subjectively quite like the blink of an eye even though my calendar informs me it exceeded a decade. Nothing can long survive `speeds much more important to us`, once you take rape out of the classroom there's scarcely any point to pretend you'll ever see hot water or purpose-made flooring ever again.
And so no, I no longer so believe, and as I don't believe I don't do. Experience has shown it is cheaper (merely cheaper in money ; it is however much cheaper in time and energy) to simply buy the car, drive it until it fails, at which point shrug, abandon it on the side of the road and buy another one than it is to attempt to maintain, fix or otherwise interact sanely with the byproducts of insanity and through the tools of insanity. Insanity breeds insanity, and the pincer movement of ever more elaborate pretense put forth by ever less worthy morons is perfectly capable of cracking any wise nut'll ever grow anywhere. So I went through two Mercedeses and a BMW in the past six months, and... fuck'all, if I ever meet a competent car mechanic at some future point I'll simply hang him by the guts of the last competent car design specialist. Because they should've been there, to live and die with the Republic, back when the Republic still lived. What the fuck else did could've been expected ?">viii</a></sup>, though I recognize the explosion makes for better TV. What you're seeing is the ordinary back room realigning of interests and powers, but this time trying desperately to hide from a voyeuristic media that caters to a demographic, i.e. you, that believes that never more than three at a time colorful but poorly understood #issues will eventually get us to Mars. "We shouldn't go to Mars." You got your wish. Off topic, speaking of Mars, here's an interesting thought: if things proceed as per y=mx+b, then the entire human race of the future interstellar diaspora will all be Chinese. Huh. What do you know, Star Trek was way off.</p>
<p>Americans, by which I mean a populace propagandized to the Left or Right or Middle, cynically believe that "wanting to get re-elected" or arrogance or ideology is what's to blame, as if 500+ career Machiavellians are too stupid to know what an underemployed theater grad knows. "They should just do the right thing!" Who will let them? You?</p>
<p>The shut down was the inevitable consequence of a government <i>not permitted to compromise</i>, smothered by the oppressive gaze of a kamikaze media that will kill itself and your country just to get a headline today. I'm starting to wonder if the reason it is always pretty white girls who get kidnapped is that the media is the one kidnapping them. And you blamed Bear Stearns for being too focused on short term profits? CNN's time horizon is your next micturition. The media demands partisanship, conflict, opposing sides, but despite having 24 hours to fill will never, ever explain the interplay between complex issues<sup><a href="#footnote_8_95757" id="identifier_8_95757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="`The media` in his very televisual understanding has a serious problem : explanations need the whole tree, whereas the `stop anytime, start anytime` paradigm of TV is exactly counter-alligned to this. There's a reason you're not allowed to talk in class, and that reason is -- what the teacher's saying now progresses from what he's been saying a minute ago, and builds the basis for what he'll be saying a minute from now. If you break the tower it has to be started over, your talking in class doesn't carve out of other people's time merely the length of your talking, as when monkeys talk over each other ; it actually ruins the entire effort of everyone else who had been following along, you very well can, with a well delivered three second interruption, destroy the half hour labour of dozens of people. What's infinitely worse : the reason they even engage in the complex, demanding, laborious and time-consuming activity of directed tower building is faith, pure and unadulterated, they're crediting the theory that their labour will bear fruit. If you fuck it up, you don't merely fuck up the instant case, but you also significantly deter any future engagement in the behaviour. In other words, all it takes is one monkey going to class to render education strictly impossible. This is why the original Oxford, the thing that actually worked as opposed to the atroctios remnant left behind, was surrounded by fortified walls equipped with cannons.
Now imagine a classroom where people come and go, randomly, like say the train station. You see now why the only possible education in this paradigm is the `teacher` masturbating herself ? And why it'll be the faux sort of `you can't accuse her of not masturbating` masturbation ? What the fuck else's she to do, rub herself raw ?
It's not possible to have culture while any idiots are tolerated anywhere in sight just as it's not possible to have cleanliness with cockroaches, or civilisation with any involvement from anxious females. Not any, not any whatsoever at all. Now you know why demonstrated courage and generally valour have been systematically and throughout history the qualification for participation. Yes ?">ix</a></sup>, preferring to feature them in segments while hyping them to a crisis. Imagine trying to have sex always on camera, and always with a goat, and always with some know-it-all<sup><a href="#footnote_9_95757" id="identifier_9_95757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="You know, amusingly enough Hitler was probably the foremost besserwisser of them all ? 
Maybe that's why these people get so livid whenever daddy's in any sense mentioned ? Maybe their problem is they'd like to pretend they invented their own genes, rather than simply, blindly &#038; incomprehendingly inherited them ?">x</a></sup> screaming at you, "get hard now! NOW! 8 seconds left! NOW! What's wrong with you?!" Jesus, can I take a minute and do this privately? "Transparency!"</p>
<p>If Senator X "makes a concession" the relevant media will proclaim him a loser and a coward, they don't want representatives, they want cage fighters. There's no reward for compromise and there's no safe place to attempt it, either. This is 100% your fault, "I can't believe how stupid these people are!" It's great how you can't find employment but have time to micromanage the U.S. Senate.<sup><a href="#footnote_10_95757" id="identifier_10_95757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="In fairness, that's precisely what `the media` told them the Senate wants from them. #PublicParticipation!
Remember, incidentally, that lulzy time when the French president took a-woman-other-than-his-wife to some social function, and the British press went livid over the `scandal` and `impropriety` etcetera, eventually culminating in the explicit threat to send a bus of `real` journalists over to Paris, to show those `incompetent` journalists from France `how journalism is really done` ?">xi</a></sup> #outrage</p>
<p>If you want to know what political career disaster looks like, have an infinitely leggy ex-sorority girl in flesh toned Manolos sitting behind a glass table in perfect lighting announce to 50% of America that you were beat by an old woman from California or an old man from Ohio. "Ha ha, what a cuckold! Back to you, Kent." You blame Congress? They are the ones who "don't get it"? When a representative democracy gets crippled by what amounts to a 3x3 magic square, it's not that they can't figure out the solution, the solution is easy, the answer is 15 and the five is a gimme, we just need someone to dare allow himself to be filmed putting the 1 on the left or the right or the center so we can finish the other 13 numbers and go bomb Syria. "Wait, what? I don't understand." Yes, that's my point exactly.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>I'm not saying the shutdown isn't a real problem, only that if the news came out only in weekly format, this particular shutdown wouldn't have happened. Or, said differently, if there was a government shut down at a time when the news came out only weekly, it would mean we were getting a new flag.</p>
<p>All of what is now being subverted by the media has been detailed in <i>The Process Of Government</i>, you should read it. But you won't, it has too many characters, and this is accurate no matter how you define characters. Come on, at least read Chapter XX, it's online. Jesus, <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/processofgovernm00bentuoft#page/446/mode/2up">here</a>. "Umm, It's pretty boring." I know, I know, you want to know how the news relates to you, and boy oh boy do I have the news network for you.</p>
<p>"But that book was written in 1908. Based on what I've seen on <i>Downton Abbey</i>, things were a lot different then."</p>
<p>Well, yes, obviously, there had just been a massive leap forward in technology and industrialization, a booming economy fueling a wealth gap, temporarily course corrected by a financial panic "precipitated" by the failure of two overspeculating brokerage houses. There were also, simultaneously, great advances in progressive causes like worker's rights and food quality, all on the background of decreasing importance of religion among educated whites in favor of science. Not physics or chemistry, but evolution. Tabloids were incomprehensibly popular, partisan media the norm. A loosening of conventional morality manifested as bored promiscuity, female bisexuality, and a flood of new porn the likes of which never existed before. </p>
<p>"That does sound different. And awesome. What did their Millennial kids inherit, what did they experience over their adult lives, say 1929-1945?"</p>
<p>I totally don't know, <i>Boardwalk Empire</i> only goes up to 1924 and <i>Mad Men</i> starts 1960.<sup><a href="#footnote_11_95757" id="identifier_11_95757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Keks.
You know ? 
And, admitting you do : can you too afford to laugh at it with me ? Hm ?">xii</a></sup></p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>The problem with blaming the shutdown on Congressional partisans is that the partisans on either side know exactly what they want.<sup><a href="#footnote_12_95757" id="identifier_12_95757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I am entirely unpersuaded by Ballas' ultimately deeply State-centric views. The various partisans on either `side` know very little, and understand even less. They, like everyone else in their said failure of an intellectual system, simply keep trying to find and buy the IBMs, those things `nobody can get fired for buying`. This doesn't amount to any kind or degree of knowledge.">xiii</a></sup> When there are specific things you want, compromise is usually possible.<sup><a href="#footnote_13_95757" id="identifier_13_95757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The fundamental problem is that nobody involved wants anything concrete, they simply want representations to appear valid. The impasse is very similar to the freeze in gender relations around puberty : neither 13yo girls nor 15yo boys want anything specific -- they merely want to not appear ridiculous. By the time the girls are about to turn the nineteen to twenty they've been long wanting specific things to go with cildhood's nonsense, and so compromise is indeed very common.">xiv</a></sup></p>
<p>The public in the middle, however, don't understand politics, only emotions given to them by TV, and so their beliefs are cobbled together in real time, improvised<sup><a href="#footnote_14_95757" id="identifier_14_95757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Actually, everything about this `public` is just as improvised. You, not benefitting of my luxurious circumstances, are probably unaware or deem it `plausibly deniable`, but how about you get a good grip on some members of this general public (slavery works, for an instance) and then examine `their opinions` without allowing for any of the usual means of escape. You'll discover some incredibly shifting sands, a magical non-place populated by cvasi-things that aren't anything in particular, a dreamlike world wherein even the words change, move and twist to support the fudamentally impermanent, entirely unexamined and therefore utterly insubstantial `ideas` of the `personalities` in question. There's nothing the fuck there, just a jumbled pile-up of circumstantially accidental improvisations half-remembered at best.">xv</a></sup>, as they get "more information." One trending topic at a time, each vacuum sealed to prevent cross contamination.<sup><a href="#footnote_15_95757" id="identifier_15_95757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Amusingly, this has nothing to do with `the public`. There's a recent `debate`, if you can call it that, among `practitioners of statistics in different branches` as to whether `their statistics` is `applicable` to the other's business. As medieval as you'd like it, and `thought` in name only, very much not reserved to the imaginary layman, that proverbial `man in the street`. They're all, equally so and exactly the same lay men.">xvi</a></sup> They don't look at things historically, culturally, humanistically, or even selfishly, there exists no system for interpreting "the facts." Compromise becomes impossible, as a simple example, when a "moderate" "thinks" there should be more restrictions on guns, they want gun owners to give up something they want very much -- <i>in exchange for nothing</i>. "But it's the right thing to do!"<sup><a href="#footnote_16_95757" id="identifier_16_95757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The amusing proposition of these demented fucks that they're not religious... What the fuck is religion besides this `it'd please baby Jesus` nonsense ?
Yes, they're very religiously unrefined, definitely, but a guy who adds instead of integrating isn't `not doing math`, he's just doing the little math his little brain can support, that's all.">xvii</a></sup> And the yelling starts, in HD.</p>
<p>Worse, they proudly announce their lack of ideology by branding themselves as Independents -- capital I, a thing, a demo. He willingly lessens his independence to become part of a group.<sup><a href="#footnote_17_95757" id="identifier_17_95757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="One of these days I should probably translate ye olde Grup si identitate piece.

If I see one more `the book` I'm gonna fucken pook.">xix</a></sup> characteristics of a group most susceptible to propaganda, more correctly "pre-propaganda", and by textbook I mean literally <i>Propaganda</i>. </p>
<p>They consider themselves leaderless. They can have representatives, they can have "evangelists" but they have to believe that their conclusions are all their own, through individual reflection and objective consideration. Interestingly, and on purpose, they believe their brains can handle such an analysis, any analysis. This isn't arrogance. They are told, by universities and the media, that their mind is prepared to do this heavy lifting as long as they are given just the <i>right</i> facts, filtered from the "noise." <i>"Where can we get the right facts, in a world of liars?</i>" Good question, maybe the news?</p>
<p>Commonly, independents have a single personal issue, say gun rights or abortion, but no personal experience with other issues, and lacking any subjective starting point, they therefore believe that ONLY objectivity will give them the truth. The less life experience they have the better; the less they've seen of the world, the fewer people they've argued with (in person, where it is real and has real consequences like punches), the less frequently their water balloon worldview is tested by people with pins, the more they will cling to the premise that "facts" are what's important. In this way the one personal issue serves as a reference point which the propaganda exploits: "hey, gun advocates, did you know you like low corporate taxes?" I do? "Yes, because the people you hate are for raising them." Consequently, raising corporate taxes is felt like an attack on the Second Amendment. "Liberals! Taking away our rights!"</p>
<p>But sometimes the complexity of issues is just overwhelming, once in a while reality creeps in, and issues are discovered to be massively complicated, and anyway he has no power to do anything.</p>
<p>No doubt this sounds depressing, he's going to start drinking heavily, or become a cynic, or go the Hemingway. So the media=propaganda fosters his regression towards a much desired solution: total alienation. The media explains how things relate to him, and as long as he understands what's going on, he feels empowered. He is given an ideology without even knowing it. Now he doesn't actually have to do anything, indeed, it's way the hell better if he does nothing. All that's required is support, and through his support not only will "the right things" happen but he'll share in the credit.<sup><a href="#footnote_19_95757" id="identifier_19_95757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Or rather : he'll adamantly `believe` that whatever the fuck actually happened will have been `the right thing`, because otherwise what about all his `investment`t to date and, more importantly, whence's that trickle of credit to come from ? God knows the opposing side's not willing to give him any quarter, MP would much rather pluck his toes from their sockets and shove them one by one down his ears than advance a bowl of soup, and thus...

<p>You'll counter that there are right leaning and left leaning independents, isn't there a difference? but this misses the point: propaganda doesn't try to get you to believe something, but to <i>do</i> something, and in this case it is to do <i>nothing</i> -- it doesn't matter what you choose to believe, as long as your outrage is done from inside your house.<sup><a href="#footnote_20_95757" id="identifier_20_95757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="What is the substance of prophecy, in your book ?">xxi</a></sup></p>
<p>This is the whole gimmick of media, not polar but triangular, right, left, middle, mobilizing an army of assonauts to feel strongly enough about something that they don't do anything. </p>
<p>I already knew that "independent" was a group looking for representation, what I was surprised by is how fast "independent" became a <i>mainstream</i> brand demo. Here is page 2, and 3, of <i>Time Magazine</i>:</p>
<p><a href="http://trilema.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ajam-003-_time_magazinev10.jpg"><img src="http://trilema.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ajam-003-_time_magazinev10-560x370.jpg" alt="ajam-003-_time_magazinev10" title="ajam-003-_time_magazinev10" width="560" height="370" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-95766" /></a></p>
<p>The first and most immediate observation is that Al Jazeera assumes its American target demo is stupid, very stupid, because here we have what is most certainly a college graduate who considers herself in need of unbiased, objective, independent news -- <i>yet she is still reading Time Magazine</i>, as her main source of <i>in depth</i> news. Rana Foroohar balanced by Fareed Zakaria, two wrongs can make a right, and "it's somewhere in the middle." She has decided that the problem with her understanding of the world is that she just needs better intel. Yes, she will say intel<sup><a href="#footnote_21_95757" id="identifier_21_95757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="She god damned fucking will, and it would be amazing!">xxii</a></sup>, it sounds more objective.</p>
<p>In order for the Time reader to have formed the quoted thought two other thoughts had to have occurred already, which in itself is astonishing, here they are: 1. She's figured out that all American news is biased, she's sick of the partisanship, after all, it doesn't brand identify her.<sup><a href="#footnote_22_95757" id="identifier_22_95757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Right ?

<p>Why would she think this? Because she's stupid? Actually, yes: the culture you know least about has all the answers, which is also why the <a href="https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2013/09/real_men_want_to_drink_guinnes.html">Guinness ad</a> hypermale in pre-season Special Olympics has chosen to tattoo gigantic Chinese characters on his arm to explain his ennui to himself. "It's a chinese proverb, 'That what doesn't kill me make me stronger.'" I hope to God a bus tries to make you stronger. Off topic, as a sociological metric, you can track a chinese person's first level of alienation from his culture by his branding himself with English-word tattoos; but you will know that all the chinese has been media powerwashed out of him when the he starts getting <i>Chinese</i> character tattoos. "It's because I'm Chinese," he'd explain, to which you would not dare reply, "yeah, I kinda figured." To which he will then not reply, "I mean, I know I'm genetically Chinese, but I don't really feel Chinese, but this signals that I'm part of a symbolic China more authentic than the actual China of my parents which I feel no real connection to, yet I know I'm supposed to feel the connection, it's not like I can go around pretending I grew up on Waltzing Matilda."<sup><a href="#footnote_23_95757" id="identifier_23_95757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This is a major problem of `travel` and `social mobility` and etcetera ; it comes with major costs that, as it happens, will be paid by the offspring.

And he'll blink, confused, "truth be told, my only real association to chinese culture is my parents screaming at me that I'm not as good as 'real' Chinese. What can be done?"

Considering the usual interplay of reversal to the mean and all that, I readily grant a set of children and parents that manage is exceedingly unlikely ; but that has entirely naught to do with disinterest, and everything to do with unmitigated, fundamental failure in either side (not on both sides though -- when that happens they're happy anon cowsies in their pasture).">xxv</a></sup></p>
<p>Al-Jazeera America is trying to call itself "objective", but right in the ad is the brand reveal: she doesn't want objectivity, she wants subjectivity explained<sup><a href="#footnote_25_95757" id="identifier_25_95757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Where by explained trebuie sa intelegi `justified`, of course.

Only one of those, but AJA brands her as out of the mainstream, unique, open to other opinions. "I like to get my information from different sources." I assume that includes twitter, 140 characters and an appeal to authority and you're good to go at the Starbucks.</p>

<p>To be clear, I'm not at all worried Al Jazeera is going to secretly convert this woman into a jihadist<sup><a href="#footnote_27_95757" id="identifier_27_95757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="There's really no danger of converting this woman, or the dude she cohabits with, or any of their ilk, into anything whatsoever, secretly, overtly or any other way.

I have no doubt Al Jazeera will be as objective as CNN, after all they took Soledad O'Brien from them to signal that very point. </p>
<p>So when I say AJA is (pre-)propaganda, I don't mean it won't be accurate, I mean that its purpose is to prepare its demo for a certain way of life.<sup><a href="#footnote_28_95757" id="identifier_28_95757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Today, in unexpected news nobody could have expected : socialism needs you to buy less meat.

<p>The news for Americans, especially Independents, lacks meaning, direction, ideology -- and they miss it, just like economically, they've been left behind.

We don't have political riots here, we have high end sit ins near the Broadway Starbucks, and occasionally 20 motorcycles will attack a minivan. "Is 'motorcycle' code?" That's where we are right now, this is what the media has trained you for, detecting racism or hypocrisy or some other character flaw in the speaker as a proxy for the complexities of the issues so you don't have to think. It is under these conditions that you expect John Boehner to "compromise" on something you don't at all understand, and scream for his beheading if he doesn't, all to the thrill of the media. "See!

						<p>Maybe, I guess. The thing is, this is probably his best article ever ; in any case it's the one out of his few hundred that floats to the top of the mind, a point proven by how exactly this article even came to be in the first place : it was required reference elsewhere. The rest of them aren't nearly as good ; this makes the previous serial, alphabetical approach quite the slog. Then again I guess I might as well give it another shot at some point and see.</p>
