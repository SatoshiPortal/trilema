I could take a dog, a broken-down whore with trillions of mileage on her.

<p>He said, "Ice, lay a double saw on me to cop a short. I know a stud for the driver.<sup><a href="#footnote_11_97417" id="identifier_11_97417" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This is retarded. Here's how the pros do it : they hire a car thief for a driver ; he's supposed to steal a car that's been parked by a square who's done with it for the day (because that's precisely what being a square is all about, and why it's so deeply wrong : they build highways, that are there 24/7, to use them two hours once and two hours again later, and that's it). It won't be reported stolen until early in the morning, by which time it'll have been long abandoned anyways. This way there's nothing to trace.">xii</a></sup> Meet me right here in this joint tomorrow night at nine. We can take off our first mark."</p>

Because why the hell not ?! People randomly stop to turn over the stopped car of people they don't even know, what, do these pimps love the whores now or something ?
Institutional know-how is the principal asset in `the life` ; what the turnout can learn from watching a whore do she can't learn from listening to rap ; the transfer of experience into knowledge through the brain is lossy enough, but the transfer of knowledge into practice through the mouth is a lost fucking cause.

<p>Red Eye got to the joint at ten-thirty. The driver was a huge stud with a rapper like a girl's. I noticed his big meat-hooks shaking on the steering wheel on our way to the West Side. Red Eye ran down our first mark. His light-maroon eyes were whirling. He had a skull full of H.</p>
<p>He said, "Paul, our first mark is a bird's nest<sup><a href="#footnote_19_97417" id="identifier_19_97417" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Very easy score, as easy as picking up the eggs from a bird's nest.">xx</a></sup> on the ground.<sup><a href="#footnote_20_97417" id="identifier_20_97417" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="That doesn't even have to be climbed for.">xxi</a></sup> It's a broad. The finger showed her to me last night. She and her old man got the best smack on the West Side. It's so good studs from all over town are rushing to cop every night. He and the broad deal out of a bar three blocks from their pad. They deal mostly in eights and sixteenths. On a weekend night like this one they take off maybe five G's. The stud is got a rep as a fast-rod joker. He ain't got no direct syndicate connections as far as I know.<sup><a href="#footnote_21_97417" id="identifier_21_97417" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Fucking 40s, man...">xxii</a></sup> We ain't got to worry about him tonight.

Everybody is scared shitless of her old man. She's got a small rod strapped to her thigh. She ain't going to pull it on the police though. That's us, strange rollers from downtown.

Not even the fact that only two in three murders are ever solved (today as then) seems to much encourage them (today as then).">xxv</a></sup> There will be a pack of hard studs in the bar. They would love to croak us on that lot to please her old man. We gotta move her fast outta the neighborhood to play her outta the scratch. We gotta be careful the rollers don't join our party.<sup><a href="#footnote_25_97417" id="identifier_25_97417" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="How's this carefulness to manifest itself, besides staying the fuck home ?">xxvi</a></sup> Her old man is doing a lot of greasing in the district.

You got to convince her."</p>
<p>Perry was really nervous. He pulled into the curb next to the bar lot. His skull was jiggling on his bull neck like he had Parkinson shakes. I was silent.</p>
<p>Red Eye's rundown had me wondering how it shaped up as a bird's nest to him.<sup><a href="#footnote_27_97417" id="identifier_27_97417" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Because he wanted it to be ; and if you call things what you want them to be that's what they become.">xxviii</a></sup> It looked like maybe a bird's nest for Dillinger.<sup><a href="#footnote_28_97417" id="identifier_28_97417" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="`We should've had shotguns for this job.`">xxix</a></sup> If the mark hadn't been a broad I'd have split and got on an El train.<sup><a href="#footnote_29_97417" id="identifier_29_97417" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="He enjoys hurting them, or rather properly speaking not quite hurting them as such.

<p>I wondered if she'd seen me before I went to the joint. What if she made me right away as Iceberg and plugged me in the skull.<sup><a href="#footnote_30_97417" id="identifier_30_97417" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="What if she made him right away as Iceberg because she was one of the cop&#038;blow seventy, and thereupon promptly asked to be forgiven, taken back, stripped and dispropertied ?

If he did we'd be found in an alley with our balls rammed down our throats. We were standing in the shadows ten feet from the broad's short.</p>
<p>I said, "Red, I better take the rod. When we step out on her, shine the flashlight right in her eyes."</p>
<p>She was walking fast when she came into the lot. Her light blue chiffon dress was billowing in the April breeze. She was walking wide-legged like a whore after a long night in a two-dollar house.<sup><a href="#footnote_31_97417" id="identifier_31_97417" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Do you suppose the narrow walk sociopopular with females is a honest signal, because if your pussy stays sore and swollen it's uncomfortable to try and walk that way ?

Speaking of which, do you suppose Sweet still has that painting ? What do you figure he does with it ?">xxxiii</a></sup> in a bitch. I looked down at the badge pinned to the wallet in my palm. It glittered like molten silver in the moonlight. The thirty-two pistol in my right hand weighed a sweaty ton.</p>
<p>She was twirling a key ring. In the utter silence the clinking sounded like the U.S. Marshal's handcuffs. She had her hands on the door handle. I stepped out of the shadows. Red Eye was behind me. I wondered if she could hear my ticker hammering. Red Eye put the light in her face. Her yellow forehead wrinkled in surprise. Her sexy jib flapped open. I grabbed her wrist and tried to crush it.</p>
<p>I roared, "Police! What's your name and why are you sneaking around back here?"<sup><a href="#footnote_33_97417" id="identifier_33_97417" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Wrong lead. `You can always go down in price, you can never go up` is what he told the runt, by his own admission trite bullshit in everyone's mouth -- yet by no-one understood.

<p>She stammered, "Gloria Jones, and I was coming to my car. I always park it here. Now get out of the way. I'm going home. The captain of this district is a personal friend of my husband's."<sup><a href="#footnote_34_97417" id="identifier_34_97417" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Perhaps more aptly, `O yeah ? What's your captain's name, runts ?`
Always a good idea to go out strong when the party with the drop deployed any chaff (here, the flashlight).">xxxv</a></sup></p>
<p>Red Eye had turned off the flashlight and moved behind her. She was looking down at the badge. She was trying to yank her wrist free.</p>
<p>I said in a low heavy voice, "You lying dope-peddling bitch. Your real moniker is Mavis Sims. We're from downtown. Your old man's no pal of ours. We're gonna bust you, bitch. I'll lay odds we've caught you dirty. Come on bitch, before we get rough. Anything I hate it's a stinking smack dealer."<sup><a href="#footnote_35_97417" id="identifier_35_97417" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Not bad, actually.">xxxvi</a></sup></p>
<p>We hurled her into the back seat of our short. Red got in beside her. I was up front with Perry. I turned facing the rear seat. There was silence as Perry drove out of the district toward central headquarters. Miss<sup><a href="#footnote_36_97417" id="identifier_36_97417" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="She's married, isn't she ?">xxxvii</a></sup> Sims was squirming in the seat. Her right hand was out of sight behind her. She was getting very jerky. I remembered that rod she was carrying. I started the shake.</p>
<p>I said, "Al, this suspect is acting peculiarly. Perhaps you'd better pull over. She might have concealed some evidence behind the seat."</p>
<p>He pulled over. Red moved toward her. She slid to the window on the other side.</p>
<p>She said, "Officers, I'm clean. It's worth fifty apiece to cut me loose.<sup><a href="#footnote_37_97417" id="identifier_37_97417" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Apparently this was pretty much routine, huh. I wonder how many innocent people had fifties to throw around thusly. Kind-of a signature therefore of the career criminal, n'est pas.">xxxviii</a></sup> If you bust me, I'll be out in an hour. Take me back to the bar. I can get the hundred and fifty from the bar owner."</p>
<p>I said, "No dice, sister. We got specific orders to bring you in. Now don't make him slap a broad around. He's gonna frisk you. He don't have to wait for a matron to do it downtown. It's proper if he thinks you're armed and we're in danger."</p>
<p>He patted the inside of her thighs. It was there, a twenty-two automatic jammed under the top of her stocking. He took it out and shoved it in his pocket, searched her bosom, purse, shoes, and hair. She was sure clean except for the rod.</p>
<p>I felt like a real chump. All this trouble for nothing. He was scratching his chin. The junkie punk had put a bum finger on the broad.</p>
<p>I was at the point of shoving her out. Then it struck me. Where did my street whores hide their scratch? In the cat!<sup><a href="#footnote_38_97417" id="identifier_38_97417" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Now you know why his wads were always damp ; and also you know damp with what.">xxxix</a></sup> In the cat, where else? The clincher was this broad's wide-legged walk. I had noticed it on the lot. She was leaning forward staring at Perry's face.</p>
<p>I said, "Joe, it's gotta be up her cat. Bitch, stretch out and put your legs across his lap."</p>
<p>She said, "The hell I will. You phony niggers ain't rollers. That big one at the wheel used to bounce at Mario's."<sup><a href="#footnote_39_97417" id="identifier_39_97417" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Ouch.">xl</a></sup></p>
<p>She was wise. The double saw I gave Red Eye had tapped me out. We had to know if she had treasure up her cat.<sup><a href="#footnote_40_97417" id="identifier_40_97417" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Maybe Mavis makes an even better bottom than Christine.

<p>I wondered how he'd handle it. I didn't wonder long. He turned brute. He punched her hard in the nose. It was like he had cut her throat. Blood splattered over the front of her dress. I felt a light spray on my face.</p>
<p>She opened her mouth to scream. He smothered it with a terrible slam to the gut. She went limp. He pulled her across him. He darted his paw between her legs.</p>
<p>When he brought his mitt out it made a kissing sound. He had a long shiny plastic tube between his index and middle fingers. It stank like rotten fish.</p>

<p>He got out and opened the door on the broad's side. He dragged her out to the sidewalk. He got in the front seat. Perry gunned away. I kept a sharp eye on Red Eye as he counted the scratch in his lap.</p>
<p>Red Eye and I netted two grand apiece. Red Eye took the packages of H. The broad dealer had forty-four hundred in the pouch. Perry and the junkie finger man got two bills apiece.</p>
<p>It was a week before we tried for the second mark. We shouldn't have. He was a reefer peddler and fence. We thought he had big scratch on him.

<p>We were playing the peel off. The mark was in the back seat. I was in the front seat. I asked for his identification. He handed me his hide. I saw it had only a few slats in it.</p>
<p>We were pulling to the curb to search him. A two-man squad car passed. The mark saw them and started screaming. They stopped and dragged Red Eye and me out to the street. They kicked and beat hell out of us. They took us down.</p>
<p>The mark was slick. Right there on the street he cracked we took a C note from him.
