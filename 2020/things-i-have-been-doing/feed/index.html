		<description>Correct or incorrect?

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I must admit that originally I was confused by the discussion of “unwinding”:

http://btcbase.org/log/2017-08-24#1702887

I modeled it in my own mind and I realized there is no unwinding necessary. The first non-legacy spend transaction(s) in each lineage are recorded by the legacy chain miners and immediately spent by the miner in the same block (by the miner who mined it) to a legacy address to themselves. This is presumably ongoing surreptitiously since 2017.

Thus only legacy miners (of the surreptitiously mined legacy chain which will not be publicly known until the attack) can cure the taint. We plebs can not get our curative transaction into the legacy chain, because the legacy miners will take the donated booty for themselves to pay for their costs of mining (their cost of restoring the legacy protocol rules as Satoshi warned would occur when “lead is stolen back and turned back into gold”):

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5147618.msg54430603#msg54430603
(click for Satoshi quotation)

I am not going to reexplain the economics and game theory again. Read this entire group discussion as I already explained it. You can start from the first pinned message at the top. All the other cryptocurrencies will be worthless, so all your verbiage about longest versus valid chain is irrelevant, unwitting sophism. You are ostensibly regurgitating nonsense promulgated by the “Power Rangers” in the ecosystem.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

		<description>Lol, fluffypony still is a blind-as-a-bat Power Ranger, declares with great confidence that in no way will legacy Bitcoin be accepted by the uneconomic majority:

https://imgur.com/a/jHrAwXV

Quote from: Satoshi Nakamoto:

“Imagine if gold turned to lead when stolen.  If the thief gives it back, it turns to gold again,”

Fluffypony is not factoring in many details, such as the stock-to-flows and cost-of-production model of Bitcoin’s value. He is also not factoring in that Satoshi will crash the price of Core on the next nosebleed top by dumping 1 million Core impostor “Bitcoins” (while retaining the 1 million actual legacy Bitcoins). The Core chain will slow down to crawl and miners will be forced to mine on legacy else go bankrupt.

Also the T r i l e m a dude will dump his 0.5 million Core imposter turds on the exchanges as well. It is going to be massive chaos. The exchanges will be destroyed. Everyone will lose everything. Monero will be destroyed.

As for no one following the One Chain To Rule Them All, again fluffy lives in some fantasy and does not understand the political-economic system we currently live in.

The Great Reset underway is going to force capital into a safe haven. All the altcoins (which includes Core) will be destroyed. Capital will have no choice but to choose the Schelling point which will be legacy Bitcoin.</description>

		<description>Indeed you did condescend on (i.e. warn) all the Power Ranger ’tards on BCT about not falling in the wood chipper. MPOE even contacted me via PM inquiring about Risto back in the day.

So now it shall be fulfilled...

“And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the Lord will not hear you in that day […] And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the Lord. And the Lord said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.”

“Samuel also said unto Saul, The Lord sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the Lord. Thus saith the Lord of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.

Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.”

The everlasting life is not forfeited:

“Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.”</description>

		<description>Bwahaha

 I &lt;a href="http://trilema.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/microscrot.jpg"&gt;cached&lt;/a&gt; it. Apparently Microsoft's come a long way since the days of Ballmer hopping up and down the stage like an enraged gorilla. Because Africa... Africa is a calling.</description>
