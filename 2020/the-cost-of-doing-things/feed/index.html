		<description>Pair of tween twins even, fancy that.

I dunno how one'd go about establishing whether it was or it wasn't ; certainly the guy is still alive, he's more than welcome to claim his lands and chattels for himself. Until such a time...</description>

Supposedly &lt;a href="http://rainerlanghans.de/"&gt;Langhans&lt;/a&gt; lived with a harem (Irm Hermann, Brigitte Streubel, Jutta Winkelmann, Gisela Getty, Anna Werner, Christa Knight) for a decade or so fifty years ago, but wikipedia doubts his notability.
