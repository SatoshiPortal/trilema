<p style="text-align: right;"><strong>Motto:</strong> understand,<br />
the history of the republic<br />
is a history of juvenile men<br />
following a polymath genius around,<br />
puffing up hubris to get him<br />
to talk  to them.<br />
~ <em>trinque</em></p>
<p>For the past... believe it or not, it's almost been nine years<sup><a href="#footnote_0_91463" id="identifier_0_91463" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="What's the longest you spent evaluating a first impression in your life to date, by the way ?">i</a></sup> I've been trying to construct something that I'm well satisfied by now can not in fact be constructed.</p>
<p>The failure is not driven by some kind of absolute necessity ; it's not anything like trying to construct a triangular circle, recipients more voluminous inside than outside, machines that move on their own power, hypercubes in bidimensional space etcetera. Nothing even remotely like it. There's no deep, fundamental reason men can't exist in the world. Leaving aside any theoretical considerations, the very practical will readily dispose : I've seen such. Although not lately, any argument attempting to show why the basic and banal "can not possibly exist" will never make it past laughable. One could as well propose that dinosaurs couldn't have ever possibly existed on the basis of a cursory survey of the nearest mall parking lot or highschool grounds.</p>
<p>The failure is not driven by a substantial problem, either<sup><a href="#footnote_1_91463" id="identifier_1_91463" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="And let it be mentioned that certainly this paste turned out, upon assays and trials, quite better than the other.">ii</a></sup>. It's not a matter of "can't make pigs' ballsacks out of discarded towels". For one thing, again, I've seen <a href=http://trilema.com/2019/a-nickels-worth-of-clues/?b=fifteen&#038;e=year%20olds#select>much better made of much less</a> ; and not as a thing <a href=http://trilema.com/2019/so-what-is-the-man-saying/?b=magic%20v&#038;e=technology#select>of magic</a>, but the plainest, most uncontroversial <a href=http://trilema.com/2015/gunnery-sargeant-dop-or-the-renaissance-man/>technology</a>. For the other thing, substance's a lot less... substantial, so to speak, than usually given credit for. Discarded towels will either ferment or burn, given enough of them some pigfeed will be squeezed, and with some pigstock the ballsacks will be produced, as long as you don't hassle me on conversion rates I can make lead into gold no problem, and so can anyone with a clue. "Money's no object" doesn't anylonger mean anything nearly even remotely close to what it used to ; such is the aperture in human capacity, ability and possibility driven by technology. </p>
<p>The problem is, I am well persuaded, purely environmental. You can't farm hermit crabs if your neighbour pesticides for spiders. There aren't going to be any old European vines in a post-philoxera world<sup><a href="#footnote_2_91463" id="identifier_2_91463" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Think of this if ye will, that both Persian and American walnut strands survive ; while only American vine survives, the European long lost to New World native pest infection.">iii</a></sup>. The importation of syphilis ended the possibility of ye olde Roman morality and ushered in protestant "moral values" necessarily, and not as a matter of any kind of "choice" or "will" of all the dour dorks involved. This is where that aperture comes in : the space's so vast now, the possibilities so ample, male maturation (always and everywhere an echo phenomenon) can no longer proceed. The misfortunate young'un can just go straight his whole, meagre existence, not encountering any walls, not finding aught to ricochet off in any meaningful sense. By my current fittings, about a century and a half in extra age is required for every decade of informational revolution, meaning kids born in the 90s will become men on their own power and through the natural process no sooner than the year 2500 -- and this provided I'm all that right about Moore's death ; and that they live so long. If not...</p>
<p>In any case, I'm for my needs such as they are satisfied that for a while (and at least for your lifetime) there's nothing interesting or important occuring that'll have human males involved to any significant degree ; and thus find myself quite ready to move on. <a href=http://trilema.com/2012/dragii-mei-avem-o-problema/?b=Problemele%20Romaniei&#038;e=povesti#select>Again</a>.</p>
<p>In practical terms, I'll be de-admining deedbot, devoicing everyone and also updating the topic in #trilema, once I get around to it. While I do wish the best of luck with whatever they might be doing to anyone interested or involved, I don't intend to continue supporting anything in that vein<sup><a href="#footnote_3_91463" id="identifier_3_91463" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I've stopped reading the logs, too, something that's never really occurred before.

But... no more.">iv</a></sup>, nor will I likely bother with irc for the foreseeable future. Who knows, maybe that changes later, as it has changed before. Then again, maybe not... who ever knows these things.</p>
<p>That'd be all.</p>

						<p>Once I get <a href="http://logs.ericbenevides.com/log/trilema/2020-03-11#1959430" >the Forum history</a> import done do you still want to move forward on that, or am I to assume you no longer have a use for an IRC logger? </p>
<p>If not I suppose I'll see if Diana Coman would like it for #ossasepia. I'd like to see this thing live somewhere at least</p>

						<p>The item was originally specced in the multi-use manner I tend to design things, so it'd have also worked as a passive db backup inter alia etc ; but yeah, you're right in that I don't foresee a need for a #trilema-Trilema bridge-logger anymore.</p>
<p>I'd say get the import done and that'll be it. I'll pay the originally bid 10 bitcents today/tomorrow on faith, so as to not have to be hassled with all that later ; I would like to be able to import the missing logbits as soon as possible though not necessarily by then.</p>
<p>Funny how things work out in practice, huh.</p>

						<p>Sounds like a plan. I'll let you know as soon as I have the historical dump ready. I have time today to work on it, though definitely I'd say no later than the end of this weekend I should have it ready (I'm aiming for before the weekend to have it ready, but being conservative in my estimates here).</p>
<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Aye. <a href="http://logs.ericbenevides.com/log/trilema/2019-09-14#1936229" >I knew this day would come</a> in one form or another someday, though I wish it weren't today. At least there's the "who knows, maybe the Republic grabs MP's attention one day and brings him back" factor at play in this case.</p>
<p>But in any case and while it may be premature, I still would like to personally thank you for your writings on Trilema, and for building and engaging with people in the Forum all of these years. I've learned more than I ever would have anywhere else. And whatever the future holds I at least have a chance at actually discerning what is going on in the world around me, whereas before there was no hope (and, as per Dunning-Kruger effect, I didn't even realise that I *wasn't* discerning the world around me at the time!).</p>
<p>I actually have a shot at owning my own life still. Thank you for giving me that shot.</p>

						<p>I am going to keep working a program with diana_coman, attempt to repair the breaches in my head, and try to make something happen with this hate I have for the system that produced me.</p>
<p>You've got my number better <a href="http://logs.ossasepia.com/log/trilema/2020-03-10#1959366" >than I've ever had it myself.</a></p>
<p>I don't know if you want to continue the wait and see with Qntra, wash your hands of it, or if you want to do something else. I've finally ate enough command line to get a script going that discovers commentable blog posts. It could find more in the pages it walks, but I can start some machine assisted spreading with it. With substantial guidance from diana_coman, <a href="http://bingology.net/2020/qntra-a-plan-for-action/" >I have a plan to follow for shoving Qntra into other people's faces.</a></p>
<p>Yet again I find myself slow and late, but for that I have still more resentment for the environment that let me grow a derp. I intend to hit some walls, mature, and shake whatever it is that keeps me less. Despite the long odds, I going to work the lessons of the past years, and hopefully I come up a somebody at some point.</p>
<p>Whether you decide to check in later to see if I've made anything of myself by using Qntra to hit some walls or wash your hands of it, thank you for helping me to realize what I am is not ok. I wish you all the best the world has. Thank you for having tried to construct.</p>

						<p>I would appreciate it if you could push the Qntra.net domain to my namesilo account as part of the S.QNTR closure. </p>
<p><a href="http://paste.deedbot.org/?id=UdEV" >http://paste.deedbot.org/?id=UdEV</a></p>
<p>I'll consider the "whatever claim to work compensation you could in principle bring" settled on that. If not, you will have given me an opportunity to try not ad-hoc'ing some other way forward, and I'll still consider the matter settled. It's not just that I lack remedy other than acceptance, the venom this situation's stirred up isn't for you. You laid out the tools, you demonstrated their use, and all of the venom is for the people, system, and environment that let me grow into a 34 year old boy despite it.</p>
<p>Thank you for everything.</p>

						<p>This was quite the blow indeed, and I don't even think it has fully sunk in yet. Regardless of what happens now, I'm incredibly grateful for Trilema and everything you've done.</p>
<p>On the topic of mp-wp, are you still interested in any aspects of this project? I plan to continue with the roadmap so that others now and in the future have access to a reliable blogging platform. If you are interested, what's the best way for me to ping you when I publish new articles related to mp-wp?</p>
<p>Also, if you still want to check out the property sometime you're more than welcome to stop by. Or if you'd rather meet in another town for lunch or something I'd be up for that as well. Hit me up whenever, and thanks again for everything.</p>

						<p>Well let's see here. On one hand afaik Trilema-as-such was the principal driver for all things MP-WP, including in terms of development. The package originated as me taring my /usr directory as it were, the last feature that was added came in <a href=http://trilema.com/2019/proper-html-linking-the-crisis-the-solution-the-resolution-conclusion/ >an article here</a> and is (iirc ?) still in the process of being digested into MP-WP, this sorta thing. By this logic then, you can spend a long time indeed merely bringing MP-WP up to par before you'd need to show me new features or anything like that.</p>
<p>There's nothing wrong with doing it, if that's what you want to do. I will definitely consider running a (complete, functional) replacement, if and once that is available ; but from experience, both yesterday with jfw and throughout history, with lobbes, with <a href=http://trilema.com/2019/how-what-not-to-do/ >alf</a>, with everyone, it must <em>actually</em> work, something that on paper or in theory appears like maybe wouldn't be that high of a standard but then in practice it becomes something entirely else, somehow.</p>
<p>With the exception of the multi-uploader (which <a href=http://trilema.com/2019/albertina-hurr/#footnote_0_88217 >as mentioned</a> I'm curently bypassing through a set of cmdlines I'm rather satisfied with), MP-WP (such as deployed for Trilema, or I suppose <a href=http://trilema.com/2019/what-is-a-blog-complete-spec-inside/ >specced</a>, though in fairness I've not had much chance to see how far that spec attempt misses the mark) is by my lights feature-complete. This means there's relatively little "<a href=http://trilema.com/2017/the-sexy-problem-formalized/ >sexyness</a>" remaining available.</p>
<p>The original impetuus for MP-WP, in the context of the Republic lo two (three ?! -- nope, watch out, it's FOUR) years ago was to produce something very much in the vein of that <a href=http://trilema.com/2013/noob-mp-or-how-it-all-began/?b=so%20basically&#038;e=here#select >original</a>, and meanwhile through the decade just as legitimate (and rather just as unanswered) question, the (apparently eternal, but in any case perdurant) "how do you bootstrap this" first question of anyone joining up. </p>
<blockquote><p>i'm willing to pay a visit, but... can i have like... a chair ? because no, "sit anywhere" isn't really an equivalent"</p></blockquote>
<p>, the man said, and it's still what it is, like it was to begin with.</p>
<p>In practical terms, however, the republic never had any use for it that I've seen, for a twin reason (you know, like sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim work in combination, one inhibits dihydropteroate synthetase, the other inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, together they're just about the strongest bacteriostatic known to man) : firstly because the republic never actually managed to draw new people in, not to any kind of substantial standard that'd be worth bothering with custom nametags, let alone custom software. Secondly, because the meagre nothing it did attract had the head screwed on so ass-backwards, EACH and every single individual dork wanted to handroll his own, his own everything whatsoever, including blogging software, in preference of applying his time and energy to anything even vaguely in danger of being useful. Frantic activity etcetera, I suspect if the typical defenses of the beings an engineer aren't well understood by now, my going into details here isn't liable to change anything.</p>
<p>I do not expect either problem will change without the republic (or whatever, just because I moved on), because I do not think the only (or just the principal) impediment to people not being stupid was me telling them to not be stupid, asking them to not be stupid, threatening them with whatever I could come up with if they kept being stupid and so forth. Maybe I'm wrong, by all means feel free to investigate / make up your own mind / whatever, I have no investment in the matter these days. As far as I can judge though, <a href=http://trilema.com/2019/the-dazzling-array-of-angles-a-celebration/?b=failure&#038;e=management#select >with or without</a> me there they'll stay exactly as fucked in the head. Be that as it may, your MP-WP will (once, or if actually completed) not exactly be as useless as if you had written it for sheep -- because as I said above, I'll consider it.</p>
<p>Moreover, going for the trifecta, most of the engineers are still indistinguishable from dogs -- the eyes may betray putative intelligence, but they're incapable of self expression even to the standards of mandatory minimums in junior high literature classes. They don't know what blogs are for, they don't want to find out, this entire literacy and working with people and etcetera thing is really too much -- they'll just go back to fiddling with the car engine in the den by themselves, or whatever it is they "do" in their solitary solipsistic world once the cock's too chaffed to permit further manipulation.</p>
<p>All this "pleasantness" out of the way, there'll also be the serious problem of the stack it sits on -- MP-WP relies on the P, M and A of LAMP. Php is, whatever its warts, certainly as good or better as any of the rest of the shit they use ; apache is, despite its size, in as good or better shape as all the rest of the crap they sit on -- for which reasons, obviously, they'll want to re-write both, and have opinions, and come up with principled stances, and bla bla bla, on and on. Strategically thus, you find yourself in an impossible position, writing a great tool for inexistent users to rest atop genuinely loathed infrastructure (genuinely loathed, specifically, in the sense weevils hate granaries). The traditional "you should sit yourself no higher than 3 but no lower than 9" sorta issue.</p>
<p>As things stand I don't really have any advice for you ; but... well, you're welcome, anyway.</p>
<p>I do plan to drop by your place sometime, prolly before Rio, but after a year's absence most vehicles are being serviced and crap, for the time being most convenient'd be going for a cup of coffee or w/e in San Jose. Hit Nicole on 72401233 and set something up.</p>

						<p>So... are you open to offers for that "web wallet" provider?</p>
<p>I'll do it for a very modest (or scandalous I suppose, depending on perspective) fee of 0.5% of the 508.95868837 BTC in the address. You'd GPG me the private key (either hex or "WIF" base58) along with an (address, value) table summing to 506.41389493.</p>

						<p>Be that as it may, think this through : I'm to get "the same thing" as what thing ? </p>
<p>These "web wallets" we're discussing physically exist, they're things, they've been here for a while, for better or worse they carved themselves a space in which they live, warts and all. The putative "web wallet" that'd be "the same thing" you offer doesn't in any sense exist ; it's not even a figment of the imagination, its entire substance is your (mis)perception that "you could do the same thing as one of them webwallets". </p>
<p>I know you can not (and with me, anyone, including the eventual beneficiaries or any other stakeholders) through the very simple check that you do not. It is altogether possible you <em>could</em>, but that is entirely irrelevant : whether you can is decided exactly as much (or, I suppose, as little) by whether you could as it's decided by whether you couldn't. I've done plenty of things I couldn't do (and plenty other that couldn't be done) through my years ; I surmise you've not done plenty of things you could do (and just as plenty that could be done).</p>
<p>This comparing reality with desire -- not even imagination, out and out desire -- and then doing substitutions and maths and things and matters on it is <a href=http://trilema.com/2013/the-wonder-of-inflation/?b=allows&#038;e=substitution#select >fashionable enough</a>, I'll grant you that ; but nothing actually works in that way -- not even imagination.</p>
<p>Too much thinking, you know ? The environmental problem in discussion is too much thinking (I've not the link ready, but somewhere I go into a discussion of how the problem of "intelligent" kids is very much the problem of man-holding-hammer, they want to solve all problems with their "intelligence" now, no other tool is acceptable anymore -- yet plenty of fundamental problems are inapproachable on that premise).</p>

						<p>Days later and ego grounded, that resolution to keep doing the same thing is gone. I'm inclined to move on to trying to do journalism as a business, but this Qntra thing started with myself as the smallest of a trio. I'll keep Qntra online for the history, but with you ending the experiment... the retard world can have Silbert flunkies trying to decode Chinese being Chinese. What's left to cover isn't what Qntra was chartered to cover.</p>
<p>Discounting anything that smells of sentiment, that stubborn determination was just that. A pile of just wanting to. I'm not yet sure what I'll do next, but I'll try to figure something out that might work inside the actual rather than hoped for world. Thank you.</p>

						<p>As to my role, in the ideal sense and by design I was the oracle of last resort. </p>
<p>Taking the <a href=http://trilema.com/2020/i-suppose-we-shall-now-recount-the-story-of-the-czech-teenager/?b=third&#038;e=triumph#select >early history</a> of the original Republic as an example, the early successful but still provincial dorks pompously assembled under standards of their own fashioning had no fucking idea that such a thing as Epyrus exists, for instance, until that king showed up on their peninsula with an inconceivably immense army ; they further had little understanding of the Mediteranean as a political space, or its workings. Someone could've told them "just hit the elephants in the head with a hammer" on the ~first~ pass, thus saving them a costly and embarassing defeat, not to mention the burying of random people alive "to please the gods" and such wonders of a desperate people.</p>
<p>So yes, this is what I was to be : the guy who can answer those few questions otherwise strictly impossible to produce an answer for, and answer them quickly and correctly.</p>
<p>In practice that never happened (though I did follow for a while a streak of "answers to questions nobody asked of me"), chiefly because the putative republic failed to ever develop to such an extent as to produce any interesting questions at all, let alone such questions as'd exceed the definitionally limited abilities of run of the mill <a href=http://trilema.com/2010/sunteti-besini/?b=parinti&#038;e=majori#select >social case workers, unionized highschool teachers and non-commissioned officers</a>. In a particularly vicious read you'd say I ended up the retired gringo at the native brothel, regaling the locals with tales of the incomprehensible in the occasional intervals their typical occupations allowed them, and otherwise the only source of the coinage moving back and forth through the Pacific islander "economy".</p>
<p>I do not think any of these can be "jobs" in any sort of sense ; you can't meaningfully hire either oracles or <a href=http://trilema.com/2014/i-love-rochester-so-will-you/?b=For%20wits&#038;e=hate#select >buffoons</a>. The US is trying, with its "office of the President of the United States", but... the results don't seem to hardly ever satisfy anyone.</p>

						<p>Dear Mr. Popescu,</p>
<p>Thank you for your work, the responsibility you entrusted me with TMSR OS and the feedback you provided on my efforts.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, I think the closure of TMSR is rational.</p>
<p>In regard to the planned visit to San Jose this 28th, it will have to be postponed until after Panama and Costa Rica calm down from the present panic and reopen the border. At this time it's hard to say when that will be ; I will update you when it's rescheduled in case you're interested to meet.</p>
<p>Jacob and I are continuing with our attempt to grow JWRD into something that matters. We're taking the lessons of TMSR's failure to use your oracle forward with us in our use of Diana Coman's ossasepia.</p>
<p>Be well.</p>

						<p>Yeah, that makes sense. It's actually kinda funny to sit and watch what the psychotic idiots come up with next. I mean, there was exactly zero reason to close the border in the first place ; by extension of which reasoning maybe... who knows, by May they've all decided they want to live underwater, or who knows what the shit, gouge their eyes out and stuff detached thumbs in the holes. In any case no future inconceivable idiocy is off the table by now, on the strenght of the complete inurement to reality they've been demonstrating thus far. We see.</p>

						<p>Meanwhile we've also gained a motto for this article.</p>
<p>I think there was something else missing, actually ; a week's distance from the absent corpse (who knew things that aren't can just as well die as things that supposedly are -- or rather, who among ye ever before came up with the plain notion, or even at this time can face it plainly stated, that what actually dies and is mourned when actual people die and are mourned isn't the actual people that were there ; but the imagined people that were not, ever, anywhere besides the mourner's own mind) makes the vaguely supposed inescapably present, like a rock, like a mountain.</p>
<p>Let's quote again : </p>
<blockquote><p>Apologies. I did an experiment and found connecting Putas and Punters they way I thought a newspaper could isn't going to work. I got a hotel room in the tourist part of town for two nights, loaded up what would have been the competition, and tried to hire one of the independent girls advertising themselves as available for hotels. Nothing weird, "I'm at X hotel". There were numerous insane transportation arrangements that didn't work, a few committments to meet followed by flaking, and the nail in the coffin was a girl that didn't believe there could be a foreigner in a hotel in Pocitos that would be interested in ordering her services the way someone orders food delivered. "Las chicas, nos cuida mucho". On a platform where the girls pay to advertise, one almost made it before cancelling because her plans for travellin 5km fell apart as the one taxi or Uber but not through Uber she was determined to secure didn't work out. ~50 percent advertised their location as "Tres Cruces", which has the bus terminal and is the hub for travel inside Uruguay. Sex may sell, but it won't do delivery.</p></blockquote>
<p>Self-obviously the "taxi or uber but not uber" item in Bingoboingo's story is the girl's own boyfriend. I'm pretty sure I explained somewhere how Uber's not a transportation service but a dating service masquerading as a transportation service, delivering on call to derpy/aspie girlies (like <a href=http://trilema.com/2020/in-a-transparent-attempt-by-the-man-to-distract-attention-from-the-internal-problems-of-the-republic-by-focusing-it-instead-on-the-lulz-in-africa/#comment-147856 >the one with the thermometer</a>) the stuff of their dreams : a young man with a car [which he got by being naive enough to underwrite debt s'as to live up to clucker-driven pretense] and in a service-oriented frame of mind. Well, does it surprise you then that 3rd world / "under development" peripheries have adapted it to their own prevailing social arrangements, and so therefore if you're a Latino boyfriend you must now deal with being misrepresented as an Uber driver by your inept girlfriend that's misrepresenting herself as a whore ?</p>
<p>Hannah has a very similar story, from the indistinct atrocity that sometime during the 2000s overtook the space formerly occupied by a country known as Romania : she called a pile of girlies, none of which were actually willing to <a href=http://trilema.com/2010/domnisoare-nude-citind/ >show up</a> -- neither among the set of the [self]<a href=http://trilema.com/2011/grozavia-dintre-femei-si-fete/ >supposed "core" of social activity</a> nor among the alleged professionals [that very much weren't] could much be found to justify any salt whatsoever. Maybe she recounts the tale sometime ; but in any case it played a major part in our leaving Romania, both physically and intellectually. It was, if you will, the commencement of <a href=http://trilema.com/2012/dragii-mei-avem-o-problema/ >that unravelling</a>.</p>
<p>Yet it's not all there, is it now. One of my drives suffered some kind of indignity during travel ; a system of adequate clearance that stayed put here can't as much as fsck it, because, get this : while both systems are ext4, there's TWO, different, incompatible ext4s. At some point, silently, the "thing" was forked, and now the tooling on my stationary ext4 machine can't mount or meaningfully interact with an ext4 filesystem that was in transit.</p>
<p>"Non-essential" services have been curtailed, as they say -- not that they hadn't been curtailing <a href=http://trilema.com/2017/fake-news-are-just-one-tail-of-the-failed-female-state/ >for a while</a> now. To <a href=http://ossasepia.com/2020/03/01/martisor/?b=the%20dark&#038;e=#select >quote Diana</a>, who knows for having learned on her own hide how this "curtailing" goes, </p>
<blockquote><p>my hometown being an industrial town with several active and large petrol refineries, the residential needs were last on the list and so usually going unmet since why would they be met anyway, not like anyone would *do* anything about it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Among such universally uniform morass of nondelivery, nonperformance, nonexistence as socialism, "peace", "women's rights" etcetera ever breed, this brave lot of a few (today, very sad ; yesterday -- very tired) "juvenile men" who did nothing, delivered nothing, performed nothing nevertheless did lots and lots and delivered oodles and performed remarkably, for years on end. I will not list the what, itemized, because it's too much to actually list. Sure, it did not in the end sum to enough ; and in most places of any value or import, in all the interesting places not enough drives practically the same effects as nothing at all. Yet it was <em>not</em> nothing at all. It was, out of a dozen hands, more than "the government", more than the pantsuit world ever could, ever has, or ever fucking will deliver ; and I would die of shame, if not tonight the next one, or some subsequent one, should I not see as much. A lot more than vanishingly very little at all may still end up not quite enough. It happens. It however will never be the same thing. That doesn't happen.</p>
<p>It always comes down to, "are you gonna do anything about it", and that in general further comes down to "whatever you can do about it ain't gonna be enough". What can you do...</p>

						<p>@<strong>nicoleci</strong> lol! What can I say, it never comes in as much more than a goatee anyway.</p>
<p>Btw thanks for the hotel recommendation, the girl is looking into that situation now so that we have a place to stay. Hopefully between now and our trip no virus-busting roadblocks* are thrown up by the local authorities. At least on the plus side hotel rates seem to have dropped like a stone since the border close...</p>

						<p>In other news, the much-fretted over <a href=http://trilema.com/2020/forum-logs-for-07-mar-2020/#2576266 >payments</a> went through alright <a href=https://live.blockcypher.com/btc/tx/0f1ae80267b45fc480d32f52e9ab842e3713b9d98ab9ea334f042e6983aca984/ >a few days ago</a> -- to nobody's particular surprise, and in any case bovine silence. </p>
<p>That afore that moment "the thinking" of the profoundly <a href=http://trilema.com/2019/being-an-engineer-the-mental-disorder/ >anti-thinking</a> idiot mind had "very certain" notions of the future that (as it happens) didn't pan out, much like after that moment the very same anti-thinking idiot mind has "very certain" notions of the immediate past (specifically as pertains to what its notions of the future were a week or two ago) is, self-evidently enough, not something to learn from. It should be "unhappened" instead, because "only the pantsuit <a href="http://trilema.com/2016/superficial-ustardian-onanism-suto/?b=Simon&#038;e=Kinahan#select" >do that</a>". If fucking only.</p>
<p>Leaving the insides to the worms, the outsides are in exactly the same shape : apparently the much hated pantsuit enemy can painlessly deliver the job exactly, all the while vaunted "republican infrastructure" as produced over nigh-on a decade's tinkering by "very impressively respectable" minds of <del datetime="2020-03-25T13:37:52+00:00">engineers</del> retarded bois can... take more tinkering -- and there's no lesson whatsoever to be learned from this either. </p>
<p>I wonder, what magic is this that makes the outside reflect the inside so very exactly ? Even without our permission ?! But we already unhappened that! And even used <a href=http://trilema.com/2013/the-danger-of-homebrew-crypto/#identifier_1_49969 >the juice</a>! Wut gives ?!?!!??!?!?</p>
<p>I'm running out of synonyms for imbecile idiocy over here, and in any case am so thoroughly spent I'm not sure I could be bothered to pick one up if it landed at my feet.</p>

						<p>In general yes ; in your particular case no, because I don't know what to do about the Bitcoin Foundation mess. Until such a time as I figure that out, there's no avenue open to you.</p>
<p>In particular the "no communication" angle is poisonous nonsense, seeing how the lot of you sat on the matter for years as if 0 communication is perfectly A-ok. The "status of MPEx" is not within your purview ; the status of jurov should be, or rather, should have been.</p>

						<p>Rando schmuck is not a "holder". Rando schmuck is a rando schmuck. </p>
<p>If rando schmuck has his bank accounts frozen because their holder (who isn't the rando schmuck but the actual sovereign party involved, ie the socialist government owning rando schmuck in question) says so ("divorce", "judgement", whatever it's called), that dun make the bank "a ponzi", it just makes the bank an obedient instrument of the sovereign (and it also makes rando schmuck's schmuckitude painfully obvious to the rando schmuck, but <em>nobody gives a shit</em>).</p>
<p>These muppets spent a decade making sure come hell or high water, they're not ever gonna be anything besides rando schmucks. The necessary consequence is the necessary consequence, what the fuck do you expect the magic of words and "calling things" is gonna do against that ?</p>

						<p>Taking you at your word for the sake of conversation, I could observe there was indeed a time when something like that'd have constituted the basis for a solution, not because I claim some portion of the grossly mismanaged foundation's piggy, but because I used to claim the position of anything-of-last-resort, and would have produced, magically, extremely valuable ideal objects cheap enough for you lot of morti di fame to enjoy (and then pretend like it was free, <a href=http://trilema.com/2018/the-leak/?b=when%20we%20need%20a%20hero&#038;e=serve#select>of course</a>).</p>
<p>All that was before the closure. I do not entertain the problems of boyhood hence. As far as I can very disinterestedly guess, your only practicable avenue is to go before whatever pantsuit court can be bothered to hear you, sue jurov (or whatever counterparty you can establish), obtain a judgement, and perhaps eventually get paid (something) on that flimsy basis. He can in turn proceed in the same manner and so on -- but talk to a lawyer or whatever they call the dudes in funny robes in your jurisdiction. </p>
<p>This is the world you folk live in, <b>by choice</b>. It's true that I attempted to build another, but please notice the past tense.</p>

						<p>thought you'd like that ;)<br />
the idea that someone or some group of people can have a monopoly on freedom is <a href="http://trilema.com/2016/how-to-participate-in-the-affairs-of-the-most-serene-republic/?b=impardonable&amp;e=failure#selection">rather ridiculous</a> on its face, no?<br />
people who are capable of thinking generally aren't interested in trading one set of presumed, alleged "owners" for another<br />
best of further luck with your future endeavours, anyway</p>

						<p>I disagree, freedom is an inevitable eventuality for all, even if it only happens when one's constituent atoms are ultimately free to spread and dissolve into the rest of the universe. many of us are able to do much better than that.</p>
<p>doesn't matter what you call it though, I'm in regardless. my path won't look quite the same as yours but that's fine.</p>
