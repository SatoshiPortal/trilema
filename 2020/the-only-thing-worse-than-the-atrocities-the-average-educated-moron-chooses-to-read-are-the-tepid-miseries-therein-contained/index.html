<p>gutenberg.org, most certainly as fine an example as any could ever be <em>imagined</em> for the utter theoretical pointlessness not to mention practical failure of any sort, kind or manner of democratic <em>anything</em> has some delightfully amusing claims to make.</p>
<p>Firstly, that while today, Thursday November the 19th a total of 4`211 books were downloaded off their hands (no doubt to the standard of a GET request being made, there's scarcely any way to ensure completion from the pov of the delivering server logs), yet 132`563 were downloaded in the past 7 days! This'd imply the past week's made up of 31 (thirty-one!!!) days just like today, and then some!</p>
<p>"Oh wait", I hear the scientificists among ye sad lot whine, "Oh wait MP, that's probably because day boundaries have a larger impact upon one item than upon the other! It's your fault, MP, it is your problem and should be your lot to rectify (at your own expense!<a href="http://trilema.com/2016/the-greatly-anticipated-bitbet-sbbet-february-2016-statement/">!</a>!) the <a href="http://trilema.com/2014/a-practical-exercise-for-people-who-cant-afford-airfare/">entrenched ineptitude</a> of such morons as'd present "past 7 days" as a statistical reporting unit consisting of a rolling 168 hours interval in the same tabulated form as a "2020-11-18" consisting of a random number of hours, something between a little over 0 to a little under 24." </p>
<p>I mean why not, right ? Fine, so it's not that a 7 day week's composed of 31 and change days like today, it's that "today" doesn't mean anything like what it says. And in the same vein, in "the last 30 days" (now that's a direct quote!) there've been "downloaded" no less than -- hold on to your butts! -- 4`916`275<sup><a href="#footnote_0_98037" id="identifier_0_98037" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The value is accurate as to their claims, but they do block archive.is/xixWS just in case you want to make sure.">i</a></sup> of them books!

<p>That's where my patience left me, in part because the number in parantheses is a download count, and if I have to divide 10 by a factor of 37 and another factor of 31 to get <del datetime="2020-11-20T00:27:46+00:00"><a href="http://trilema.com/2016/o-hey-is-it-november-yet/#comment-155828">Trump's votes</a></del> <del datetime="2020-11-20T00:27:46+00:00"><a href="http://trilema.com/2020/san-jose-vive-and-other-narrative-fancies-of-the-failed-female-state/">actual COVID cases</a></del> something or the other to do with "the public", whatever it is... there'd be not very much left, you understand me ? 10 / 37 / 31 = 0.00 (or 0.01 with rounding), a figure coincidentally identical to the cumulative readership of libertard hack writing this year.</p>
<p>So yeah, in part because of that ; but in even larger part because do you know what <a href="http://trilema.com/2020/the-strategy-of-socialism/">unspeakable idiocy</a> that Happy Prince bullshit is ? You haven't read it, have you. I have, and it's enough to send that sad faggot who shuns <a href="http://trilema.com/2012/a-minor-point-of-reference-and-other-things/">his proper name</a> to permanent jail forever just for being such an indescribably trite philistine. Hurr durr Oscar Wilde, here, have a sampling : </p>
<blockquote><p>"Far away," continued the statue in a low musical voice, "far away in a little street there is a poor house. One of the windows is open, and through it I can see a woman seated at a table. Her face is thin and worn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle, for she is a seamstress. She is embroidering passion-flowers on a satin gown for the loveliest of the Queen’s maids-of-honour to wear at the next Court-ball. In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying ill.  He has a fever, and is asking for oranges. His mother has nothing to give him but river water, so he is crying.  Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, will you not bring her the ruby out of my sword-hilt? My feet are fastened to this pedestal and I cannot move."</p></blockquote>
<p>Rubies for fucking seamstresses, <a href="http://trilema.com/2014/agency-and-other-notes/">how do you like that</a>! The precious cuntlets / <a href="http://trilema.com/2013/various-kinds-of-stickiness/#comment-156045">"collegiate"</a> baristas of 1800 are just as too special to whore out like healthy (especially in the head) contemporaries. They gotta be speshul and get rubies from the sky for it, too! Just like you! </p>
<p>The whole fucking list is gunk just like this, not worth the first read, and I now wish to know how the fuck is it that every time mediocrity gets left in charge of perpetuating anything, all it ever seems to manage is perpetuating its own image ? God-earfucked Dickens, Austen and all the rest of the spurious nothings of the "Progressive" age, the miseries of fester, the rats eating the aesthetic eyes out of Art's long dead skull, somehow mistaken for "the [...] life [...] in that [...] general area". The parasites, the know-nothings, the most regrettable blemishes carefully collected and curated for future maggot generations.</p>
<p>It makes me want to puke. And don't even fucking dare come at me with anything like "But MP, there's like, Kafka in there, the cultural-flavored Kafka scratch-n-sniff sticker that cereal boxes use to certify culturality (also kosher), not to mention expunged Twain, context-free Carroll... what more can you ask, it's totally cultural!" because it'll make me want to puke <em>on you</em>. </p>

<p>At least your forefathers <em>were fucking honest</em>, straight-forward if simple-minded simpletons. You've meanwhile squandered even that! For shame.</p>

						<p>Nu ca e... e d<b>ras</b>tic de-a dreptul, ce sa mai.</p>
<blockquote><p>A new breed of females was slowly beginning to emerge in the early 1900s and they couldn’t help but attract attention from all, especially writers. The 1920s was a decadent, fast-paced decade filled with glamour, hope, and endless possibilities. No longer were they going to be held back by the ancestral Victorian customs by which they were raised. Mass involvement of women in voluntary organizations to aid the war effort led to the coalescing of social classes. The flapper represented that woman who had not only fought for political rights but was also struggling to ensure social equality. Young women during the age were more sexually vibrant than ever; they were much more open about sex in general and were not afraid to show it. Openness related to sexual awareness also allowed women to recognize that their gender submission, which had dominated the cultures that came before them, was no longer necessary. The birth of mass culture, as well as the introduction of new entertainment and music and the illegalization of alcohol through Prohibition, all contributed to the social and political awareness of young women living in 1920s America. Despite the modern-day notion that flappers (the most rebellious of the young women during the 1920s) had money because of the conception that only the elite had influence over society, it was timidly suggested by reporters of the time that "there were lots of flappers who weren't rich -- beginning young female artists, superior office girls, professional or pseudo-professional girls, apprentice writers, precious lady bums, or what not. They were also seen flapping about. Sexual freedom, as highlighted by the media, the automobile, and new technology were all rooted in the social transformation that was taking place. </p>
<p>Artists and writers of the 1920s rejected the old social norms and the new business society that had emerged as a result technological advances, and embraced the freedom of expression that the Jazz Age introduced; and as a result, much of the writing done in this decade reflected the changes that society was undergoing. Many authors wrote fiction, but even then, the majority of that fiction was still based on real-life experiences during the Twenties. One of the most famous authors to emerge from this vibrant decade was F. Scott Fitzgerald. There was no better author to document such an age than a man also caught up in the middle of it. Fitzgerald was the poster boy for the extravagant decade and chose to focus the majority of his writings on all of the splendor, spoils, and aftermath of those who chose the party lifestyle. Originally born as Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald, before shortening his name after publication, he shares his name with the famous songwriter of the same name who wrote the "Star Spangled Banner." In 1920, Fitzgerald married his very famous and unpredictable wife, Zelda, with whom he had maintained contact during his time in the Army. Scott Fitzgerald’s first novel was very popular with the war generation and brought him almost immediate fame and fortune. However,he quickly developed a playboy reputation, and became well-known for his heavy drinking and continuous partying, which, again, became something that many of his works were based around. After the debut of his first two successful novels, F. Scott’s career began to dwindle because he could no longer find inspiration. He and Zelda moved to Europe, more specifically, Paris, where he unintentionally became part of the Lost Generation.</p></blockquote>
