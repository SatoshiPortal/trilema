<p>In wrongs you're stubborn, in repentance lax, quick to regret, yet quicker to re-do. An abcess that will ever pray -- but for release and not redress. For room in which to ooze, ye lock that's made of wax.</p>

<p>Silk-eating moth, that fancies the silk-making grub a mere puppet, on its silky strings so strung as best to serve a fluttering array of dung ready to burn itself on the first candle nub.</p>
<p>Each step, however took, is your descent, engine incapable, by firm, unmoving law to ever lift a single strand of straw without first lowering a bale for rent.</p>
<p>All rakes, and all bankrupt, and all despaired, squeezing and kissing with bare teeth such breast as can be had off an old whore's martyr'd chest. Do tell, is the decrepit orange sweeter shared ?</p>
<p>Sealed in the brain, such as it is, helminths abound, and swarm, their mass each last pore bungs. With every breath Death further fills your lungs, yet piercing wails render in pastel tints.</p>

                                POEMS OF
                               BAUDELAIRE
                           _A translation of_

                              ROY CAMPBELL
                          _Translator's Note_
These poems have been known to four generations, ever since they were first popularised by Swinburne, as the _Flowers of Evil_, but `Flowers of Sickness,` `Flowers of Anguish` or `Flowers of Pain` would better describe a great many of them than `Flowers of Evil`, since the word _mal_ covers all these interpretations.
Having had considerable success with my translation of a Saint, St. John of the Cross, I determined to translate a fellow-sinner who is hardly less a believer, even in his rebellious and blasphemous moments, than the Saint himself. I have been reading Baudelaire since I was fifteen, carried him in my haversack through two wars, and loved him longer and more deeply than any other poet. I translated St. John of the Cross because he miraculously saved my life in Toledo in 1936. I am translating Baudelaire because he lived my life up to the same age, with similar sins, remorses, ostracisms, and poverty and the same desperate hope of reconciliation and pardon: and I may say to him as Manuel Barbosa du Bocage said to Luis de Camoes,
        `And though in shame and all precarious shifts
         You were my Model--mine's the crowning sorrow,
         To share your luck, but lack your towering gifts.`
I have tried to be as colloquial as possible, though I had to come down to _Thou_ and _Thee_ in the translation of his Latin poem in imitation of a Mediaeval hymn. I have also avoided Cockney rhymes as far as was possible for an r-less colonial to do. Poetic abbreviations like _o'er_, _ere_, _mid_, etc., I have generally avoided, in spite of their metrical convenience, since they long ago fell out of vernacular use, and therefore impair the sense of reality in a poem or the translation of one.
I beg the reader's indulgence if I have erred on the slangy side: but I feared to offend my great original who had a horror of the pompously poetic.
If I have not made as good a translation of Baudelaire as in the case of San Juan it will not be so much from lack of striving but for want of supernatural aid for in the latter case the Saint only needed to raise his stick and say `_ArrÃ© burro!_` (`Gee up, donkey!`) to me--and the Donkey trotted.

                    This translation is dedicated to
                          ROB AND FELICIA LYLE
                         LES FLEURS DU MAL 1861
                            _To the Reader_
        Folly and error, avarice and vice,
        Employ our souls and waste our bodies' force.
        As mangey beggars incubate their lice,
        We nourish our innocuous remorse.
        Our sins are stubborn, craven our repentance.
        For our weak vows we ask excessive prices.
        Trusting our tears will wash away the sentence,
        We sneak off where the muddy road entices.
        Cradled in evil, that Thrice-Great Magician,
        The Devil, rocks our souls, that can't resist;
        And the rich metal of our own volition
        Is vaporised by that sage alchemist.
        The Devil pulls the strings by which we're worked:
        By all revolting objects lured, we slink
        Hellwards; each day down one more step we're jerked
        Feeling no horror, through the shades that stink.
        Just as a lustful pauper bites and kisses
        The scarred and shrivelled breast of an old whore,
        We steal, along the roadside, furtive blisses,
        Squeezing them, like stale oranges, for more.
        Packed tight, like hives of maggots, thickly seething,
        Within our brains a host of demons surges.
        Deep down into our lungs at every breathing,
        Death flows, an unseen river, moaning dirges.
        If rape or arson, poison, or the knife
        Has wove no pleasing patterns in the stuff
        Of this drab canvas we accept as life--
        It is because we are not bold enough!
        Amongst the jackals, leopards, mongrels, apes,
        Snakes, scorpions, vultures, that with hellish din,
        Squeal, roar, writhe, gambol, crawl, with monstrous shapes,
        In each man's foul menagerie of sin--
        There's one more damned than all. He never gambols,
        Nor crawls, nor roars, but, from the rest withdrawn,
        Gladly of this whole earth would make a shambles
        And swallow up existence with a yawn . . .
        Boredom! He smokes his hookah, while he dreams
        Of gibbets, weeping tears he cannot smother.
        You know this dainty monster, too, it seems--
        Hypocrite reader!--You!--My twin!--My brother!
                            SPLEEN ET IDEAL
                                   I
                             _Benediction_
        When by an edict of the powers supreme
        A poet's born into this world's drab space,
        His mother starts, in horror, to blaspheme
        Clenching her fists at God, who grants her grace.
        `Would that a nest of vipers I'd aborted
        Rather than this absurd abomination.
        Cursed be the night of pleasures vainly sported
        On which my womb conceived my expiation.
        Since of all women I am picked by You
        To be my Mate's aversion and his shame:
        And since I cannot, like a _billet-doux_,
        Consign this stunted monster to the flame,
        I'll turn the hatred, which You load on me,
        On the curst tool through which You work your spite,
        And twist and stunt this miserable tree
        Until it cannot burgeon for the blight.`
        She swallows down the white froth of her ire
        And, knowing naught of schemes that are sublime,
        Deep in Gehenna, starts to lay the pyre
        That's consecrated to maternal crime.
        Yet with an unseen Angel for protector
        The outcast waif grows drunken with the sun,
        And finds ambrosia, too, and rosy nectar
        In all he eats or drinks, suspecting none.
        He sings upon his _Via Crucis_, plays
        With winds, and with the clouds exchanges words:
        The Spirit following his pilgrim-ways
        Weeps to behold him gayer than the birds.
        Those he would love avoid him as in fear,
        Or, growing bold to see one so resigned,
        Compete to draw from him a cry or tear,
        And test on him the fierceness of their kind.
        In food or drink that's destined for his taste
        They mix saliva foul with cinders black,
        Drop what he's touched with hypocrite distaste,
        And blame themselves for walking in his track.
        His wife goes crying in the public way
        --`Since fair enough he finds me to adore,
        The part of ancient idols I will play
        And gild myself with coats of molten ore.
        I will get drunk on incense, myrrh, and nard,
        On genuflexions, meat, and heady wine.
        Out of his crazed and wondering regard,
        I'll laugh to steal prerogatives divine.
        When by such impious farces bored at length,
        I'll place my frail strong hand on him, and start,
        With nails like those of harpies in their strength,
        To plough myself a pathway to his heart.
        Like a young bird that trembles palpitating,
        I'll wrench his heart, all crimson, from his chest,
        And to my favourite beast, his hunger sating,
        Will fling it in the gutter with a jest.`
        Skyward, to where he sees a Throne blaze splendid,
        The pious Poet lifts his arms on high,
        And the vast lightnings of his soul extended
        Blot out the crowds and tumults from his eye.
        `BlessÃ¨d be You, O God, who give us pain,
        As cure for our impurity and wrong--
        Essence that primes the stalwart to sustain
        Seraphic raptures that were else too strong.
        I know that for the Poet You've a post,
        Where the blest Legions take their ranks and stations,
        Invited to the revels with the host
        Of Virtues, Powers, and Thrones, and Dominations.
        That grief's the sole nobility, I know it,
        Where neither Earth nor Hell can make attacks,
        And that, to deck my mystic crown of poet,
        All times and universes paid their tax.
        But all the gems from old Palmyra lost,
        The ores unmixed, the pearls of the abyss,
        Set by Your hand, could not suffice the cost
        Of such a blazing diadem as this.
        Because it will be only made of light,
        Drawn from the hearth of the essential rays,
        To which our mortal eyes, when burning bright,
        Are but the tarnished mirrors that they glaze.`
                                   II
                            _The Albatross_
        Sometimes for sport the men of loafing crews
        Snare the great albatrosses of the deep,
        The indolent companions of their cruise
        As through the bitter vastitudes they sweep.
        Scarce have they fished aboard these airy kings
        When helpless on such unaccustomed floors,
        They piteously droop their huge white wings
        And trail them at their sides like drifting oars.
        How comical, how ugly, and how meek
        Appears this soarer of celestial snows!
        One, with his pipe, teases the golden beak,
        One, limping, mocks the cripple as he goes.
        The Poet, like this monarch of the clouds,
        Despising archers, rides the storm elate.
        But, stranded on the earth to jeering crowds,
        The great wings of the giant baulk his gait.
                                  III
                              _Elevation_
        Above the valleys and the lakes: beyond
        The woods, seas, clouds and mountain-ranges: far
        Above the sun, the aethers silver-swanned
        With nebulae, and the remotest star,
        My spirit! with agility you move
        Like a strong swimmer with the seas to fight,
        Through the blue vastness furrowing your groove
        With an ineffable and male delight.
        Far from these foetid marshes, be made pure
        In the pure air of the superior sky,
        And drink, like some most exquisite liqueur,
        The fire that fills the lucid realms on high.
        Beyond where cares or boredom hold dominion,
        Which charge our fogged existence with their spleen,
        Happy is he who with a stalwart pinion
        Can seek those fields so shining and serene:
        Whose thoughts, like larks, rise on the freshening breeze,
        Who fans the morning with his tameless wings,
        Skims over life, and understands with ease
        The speech of flowers and other voiceless things.
                                   IV
                           _Correspondences_
        Nature's a temple where each living column,
        At times, gives forth vague words. There Man advances
        Through forest-groves of symbols, strange and solemn,
        Who follow him with their familiar glances.
        As long-drawn echoes mingle and transfuse
        Till in a deep, dark unison they swoon,
        Vast as the night or as the vault of noon--
        So are commingled perfumes, sounds, and hues.
        There can be perfumes cool as children's flesh,
        Like fiddles, sweet, like meadows greenly fresh.
        Rich, complex, and triumphant, others roll
        With the vast range of all non-finite things--
        Amber, musk, incense, benjamin, each sings
        The transports of the senses and the soul.
                                   V
        I love the thought of those old naked days
        When Phoebus gilded torsos with his rays,
        When men and women sported, strong and fleet,
        Without anxiety or base deceit,
        And heaven caressed them, amorously keen
        To prove the health of each superb machine.
        Cybele then was lavish of her guerdon
        And did not find her sons too gross a burden:
        But, like a she-wolf, in her love great-hearted,
        Her full brown teats to all the world imparted.
        Bold, handsome, strong, Man, rightly, might evince
        Pride in the glories that proclaimed him prince--
        Fruits pure of outrage, by the blight unsmitten,
        With firm, smooth flesh that cried out to be bitten.
        Today the Poet, when he would assess
        Those native splendours in the nakedness
        Of man or woman, feels a sombre chill
        Enveloping his spirit and his will.
        He meets a gloomy picture, which he loathes,
        Wherein deformity cries out for clothes.
        Oh comic runts! Oh horror of burlesque!
        Lank, flabby, skewed, pot-bellied, and grotesque!
        Whom their smug god, Utility (poor brats!)
        Has swaddled in his brazen clouts `ersatz`
        As with cheap tinsel. Women tallow-pale,
        Both gnawed and nourished by debauch, who trail
        The heavy burden of maternal vice,
        Or of fecundity the hideous price.
        We have (corrupted nations) it is true
        Beauties the ancient people never knew--
        Sad faces gnawed by cancers of the heart
        And charms which morbid lassitudes impart.
        But these inventions of our tardy muse
        Can't force our ailing peoples to refuse
        Just tribute to the holiness of youth
        With its straightforward mien, its forehead couth,
        The limpid gaze, like running water bright,
        Diffusing, careless, through all things, like the light
        Of azure skies, the birds, the winds, the flowers,
        The songs, and perfumes, and heart-warming powers.
                                   VI
                             _The Beacons_
        Rubens, the grove of ease, Nepenthe's river
        Couch of cool flesh, where Love may never be,
        But where life ever flows and seems to quiver
        As air in heaven, or, in the sea, the sea.
        Da Vinci, dusky mirror and profound,
        Where angels, smiling mystery, appear,
        Shaded by pines and glaciers, that surround
        And seem to shut their country in the rear.
        Rembrandt, sad hospital of murmurs, where
        Adorned alone by one great crucifix,
        From offal-heaps exhales the weeping prayer
        That winter shoots a sunbeam to transfix.
        Vague region, Michaelangelo, where Titans
        Are mixed with Christs: and strong ghosts rise, in crowds,
        To stand bolt upright in the gloom that lightens,
        With gristly talons tearing through their shrouds.
        Rage of the boxer, mischief of the faun,
        Extracting beauty out of blackguards' looks--
        The heart how proud, the man how pinched and drawn--
        Puget the mournful emperor of crooks!
        Watteau, the carnival, where famous hearts
        Go flitting by like butterflies that burn,
        While through gay scenes each chandelier imparts
        A madness to the dancers as they turn.
        Goya's a nightmare full of things unguessed,
        Of foeti stewed on nights of witches' revels.
        Crones ogle mirrors; children scarcely dressed,
        Adjust their hose to tantalise the devils.
        A lake of gore where fallen angels dwell
        Is Delacroix, by firwoods ever fair,
        Where under fretful skies strange fanfares swell
        Like Weber's sighs and heartbeats in the air.
        These curses, blasphemies, and lamentations,
        These ecstasies, tears, cries and soaring psalms--
        Through endless mazes, their reverberations
        Bring, to our mortal hearts, divinest balms.
        A thousand sentinels repeat the cry.
        A thousand trumpets echo. Beacon-tossed
        A thousand summits flare it through the sky,
        A call of hunters in the jungle lost.
        And certainly this is the most sublime
        Proof of our worth and value, Oh Divinity,
        That this great sob rolls on through ageless time
        To die upon the shores of your infinity.
                                  VII
                            _The Sick Muse_
        Alas, poor Muse, what ails you so today?
        Your hollow eyes with midnight visions burn,
        And turn about, in your complexion play
        Madness and horror, cold and taciturn.
        Green succubus and rosy imp--have they
        Poured you both fear and love into one glass?
        Or with his tyrant fist the nightmare, say,
        Submerged you in some fabulous morass?
        I wish that, breathing health, your breast might nourish
        Ever robuster thoughts therein to flourish:
        And that your Christian blood, in rythmic flow,
        With those old polysyllables would chime,
        Where, turn about, reigned Phoebus, sire of rhyme,
        And Pan, the lord of harvests long ago.

                            _The Venal Muse_
        Muse of my heart, of palaces the lover,
        Where will you, when the blast of winter blows,
        In the black boredom of snowed lights, discover
        A glowing brand to warm your violet toes?
        How will you there revive your marbled skin
        At the chill rays your shutters then disperse?
        The gold of azure heavens will you win
        When empty are your palate and your purse?
        You'll need each evening, then, to earn your bread,
        As choirboys swinging censers that are dead
        Who sing _Te Deums_ which they disbelieve:
        Or, fasting pierrette, trade your loveliness
        And laughter, soaked in tears that none can guess,
        The boredom of the vulgar to relieve.

                            _The Evil Monk_
        The walls of cloisters on their frescoed lath
        Displayed, in pictures, sacred truths of old,
        Whose sight would warm the entrails of one's faith
        To temper their austerity and cold.
        In times when every sowing flowered for Christ
        Lived famous monks, now out of memory's reach;
        The graveyard for their library sufficed,
        And Death was glorified in simple speech.
        My soul's a grave, where, evil cenobite,
        To all eternity I have been banned.
        Nothing adorns this cloister full of spite.
        O idle monk! Say, to what end were planned
        The living spectacle of my sad plight,
        Love of my eye, or labour of my hand?

                              _The Enemy_
        My youth was but a tempest, dark and savage,
        Through which, at times, a dazzling sun would shoot.
        The thunder and the rain have made such ravage
        My garden is nigh bare of rosy fruit.
        Now I have reached the Autumn of my thought,
        And spade and rake must toil the land to save,
        That fragments of my flooded fields be sought
        From where the water sluices out a grave.
        Who knows if the new flowers my dreams prefigure,
        In this washed soil should find, as by a sluit,
        The mystic nourishment to give them vigour?
        Time swallows up our life, O ruthless rigour!
        And the dark foe that nibbles our heart's root,
        Grows on our blood the stronger and the bigger!

                               _Ill Luck_
        So huge a burden to support
        Your courage, Sisyphus, would ask;
        Well though my heart attacks its task,
        Yet Art is long and Time is short.
        Far from the famed memorial arch
        Towards a lonely grave I come.
        My heart in its funereal march
        Goes beating like a muffled drum.
        --Yet many a gem lies hidden still
        Of whom no pick-axe, spade, or drill
        The lonely secrecy invades;
        And many a flower, to heal regret,
        Pours forth its fragrant secret yet
        Amidst the solitary shades.

                             _Former Life_
        I've lived beneath huge portals where marine
        Suns coloured, with a myriad fires, the waves;
        At eve majestic pillars made the scene
        Resemble those of vast basaltic caves.
        The breakers, rolling the reflected skies,
        Mixed, in a solemn, enigmatic way,
        The powerful symphonies they seem to play
        With colours of the sunset in my eyes.
        There did I live in a voluptuous calm
        Where breezes, waves, and splendours roved as vagrants;
        And naked slaves, impregnated with fragrance,
        Would fan my forehead with their fronds of palm:
        Their only charge was to increase the anguish
        Of secret grief in which I loved to languish.

                         _Gipsies on the Road_
        The tribe of seers, last night, began its march
        With burning eyes, and shouldering its young
        To whose ferocious appetites it swung
        The wealth of hanging breasts that nought can parch.
        The men, their weapons glinting in the rays,
        Walk by the convoy where their folks are carted,
        Sweeping the far-off skylines with a gaze
        Regretful of Chimeras long-departed.
        Out of his hole the cricket sees them pass
        And sings the louder. Greener grows the grass
        Because Cybele loves them, and has made
        The barren rock to gush, the sands to flower,
        To greet these travellers, before whose power
        Familiar futures open realms of shade.

                           _Man and the Sea_
        Free man, you'll always love the sea--for this,
        That it's a mirror, where you see your soul
        In its eternal waves that chafe and roll;
        Nor is your soul less bitter an abyss.
        In your reflected image there to merge,
        You love to dive, its eyes and limbs to match.
        Sometimes your heart forgets its own, to catch
        The rhythm of that wild and tameless dirge.
        The two of you are shadowy, deep, and wide.
        Man! None has ever plummeted your floor--
        Sea! None has ever known what wealth you store--
        Both are so jealous of the things you hide!
        Yet age on age is ended, or begins,
        While you without remorse or pity fight.
        So much in death and carnage you delight,
        Eternal wrestlers! Unrelenting twins!

                           _Don Juan in Hell_
        When, having reached the subterranean wave,
        Don Juan paid his passage from the shore,
        Proud as Antisthenes, a surly knave
        With vengeful arms laid hold of either oar.
        With hanging breasts between their mantles showing
        Sad women, writhing under the black sky,
        Made, as they went, the sound of cattle lowing
        As from a votive herd that's led to die.
        Sganarelle for his wages seemed to linger,
        And laughed; while to the dead assembled there,
        Don Luis pointed out with trembling finger
        The son who dared to flout his silver hair.
        Chilled in her crÃªpe, the chaste and thin Elvira,
        Standing up close to her perfidious spouse,
        Seemed to be pleading from her old admirer
        For that which thrilled his first, unbroken vows.
        A great stone man in armour leaped aboard;
        Seizing the helm, the coal-black wave he cleft.
        But the calm hero, leaning on his sword,
        Had eyes for nothing but the wake they left.
                                  XVI
                       _The Punishment of Pride_
        When first Theology in her young prime
        Flourished with vigour, in that wondrous time,
        Of an illustrious Doctor it was said
        That, having forced indifferent hearts to shed
        Tears of emotion, moved to depths profound:
        And having to celestial glory found
        Marvellous paths, to his own self unknown,
        Where only purest souls had fared alone--
        Like a man raised too high, as in a panic,
        Crazed with a vertigo of pride satanic,
        He cried `Poor Christ, I've raised you to renown!
        But had I wished to bring you crashing down
        Probing your flaws, your shame would match your pride
        And you'd be but a foetus to deride!`
        Immediately he felt his wits escape,
        That flash of sunlight veiled itself in crÃªpe.
        All chaos through his intellect was rolled,
        A temple once, containing hoards of gold,
        By opulence and order well controlled,
        And topped with ceilings splendid to behold.
        Silence and night installed their reign in him.
        It seemed he was a cellar dank and dim,
        To which no living man could find the key;
        And from that day a very beast was he.
        And while he wandered senseless on his way,
        Not knowing spring from summer, night from day,
        Foul, dirty, useless, and with no hereafter,
        He served the children as a butt for laughter.

                                _Beauty_
        I'm fair, O mortals, as a dream of stone;
        My breasts whereon, in turn, your wrecks you shatter,
        Were made to wake in poets' hearts alone
        A love as indestructible as matter.
        A sky-throned sphinx, unknown yet, I combine
        The cygnet's whiteness with a heart of snow.
        I loathe all movement that displaces line,
        And neither tears nor laughter do I know.
        Poets before my postures, which I seem
        To learn from masterpieces, love to dream
        And there in austere thought consume their days.
        I have, these docile lovers to subject,
        Mirrors that glorify all they reflect--
        These eyes, great eyes, eternal in their blaze!

                              _The Ideal_
        It's not with smirking beauties of vignettes,
        The shopsoiled products of a worthless age,
        With buskined feet and hands for castaÃ±ets--
        A heart like mine its longing could assuage.
        I leave Gavarni, poet of chloroses,
        His twittering flock, anaemic and unreal.
        I could not find among such bloodless roses,
        A flower to match my crimson-hued ideal.
        To this heart deeper than the deepest canyon,
        Lady Macbeth would be a fit companion,
        Crime-puissant dream of Aeschylus; or you,
        Daughter of Buonarroti, stately Night!
        Whose charms to suit a Titan's appetite,
        You twist, so strange, yet peaceful, to the view.

                             _The Giantess_
        Of old when Nature, in her verve defiant,
        Conceived each day some birth of monstrous mien,
        I would have lived near some young female giant
        Like a voluptuous cat beside a queen;
        To see her body flowering with her soul
        Freely develop in her mighty games,
        And in the mists that through her gaze would roll
        Guess that her heart was hatching sombre flames;
        To roam her mighty contours as I please,
        Ramp on the cliff of her tremendous knees,
        And in the solstice, when the suns that kill
        Make her stretch out across the land and rest,
        To sleep beneath the shadow of her breast
        Like a hushed village underneath a hill.

                               _The Mask_
               (An allegoric statue in Renaissance style)
                    TO ERNEST CHRISTOPHE, _sculptor_
        Study with me this Florentinian treasure,
        Whose undulous and muscular design
        Welds Grace with Strength in sisterhood divine;
        A marvel only wonderment can measure,
        Divinely strong, superbly slim and fine,
        She's formed to reign upon a bed of pleasure
        And charm some prince or pontiff in his leisure.
        See, too, her smile voluptuously shine,
        Where sheer frivolity displays its sign:
        That lingering look of languor, guile, and cheek,
        The dainty face, which veils of gauze enshrine,
        That seems in conquering accents thus to speak:--
        `Pleasure commands me. Love my brow has crowned!`
        Enamouring our thoughts in humble duty,
        True majesty with merriment is found.
        Approach, let's take a turn about her beauty.
        O blasphemy! Dread shock! Our hopes to pique,
        This lovely body, promising delight,
        Ends at the top in a two-headed freak.
        But no! it's just a mask that tricked our sight,
        Fooling us with that exquisite grimace:
        On the reverse you see her proper face,
        Fiercely convulsed, in its true self revealed,
        Which from our sight that lying mask concealed.
        --O sad great beauty! The grand river, fed
        By your rich tears, debouches in my heart.
        Though I am rapt with your deceptive art,
        My soul is slaked upon the tears you shed.
        And yet why does she weep? Such peerless grace
        Could trample down the conquered human race.
        What evil gnaws her flank so strong and sleek?
        She weeps because she's lived, and that she lives.
        Madly she weeps for that. But more she grieves
        (And at the knees she trembles and goes weak)
        Because tomorrow she must live, and then
        The next day, and forever--like us men.

                            _Hymn to Beauty_
        Did you spring out of heaven or the abyss,
        Beauty? Your gaze infernal, yet divine,
        Spreads infamy and glory, grief and bliss,
        And therefore you can be compared to wine.
        Your eyes contain both sunset and aurora:
        You give off scents, like evenings storm-deflowered:
        Your kisses are a philtre: an amphÃ³ra
        Your mouth, that cows the brave, and spurs the coward.
        Climb you from gulfs, or from the stars descend?
        Fate, like a fawning hound, to heel you've brought;
        You scatter joy and ruin without end,
        Ruling all things, yet answering for naught.
        You trample men to death, and mock their clamour.
        Amongst your gauds pale Horror gleams and glances,
        And Murder, not the least of them in glamour,
        On your proud belly amorously dances.
        The dazzled insect seeks your candle-rays,
        Crackles, and burns, and seems to bless his doom.
        The groom bent o'er his bride as in a daze,
        Seems, like a dying man, to stroke his tomb.
        What matter if from hell or heaven born,
        Tremendous monster, terrible to view?
        Your eyes and smile reveal to me, like morn,
        The Infinite I love but never knew.
        From God or Fiend? Siren or Sylph? Invidious
        The answer--Fay with eyes of velvet, ray,
        Rhythm, and perfume!--if you make less hideous
        Our universe, less tedious leave our day.

                            _Exotic Perfume_
        When I, with eyes shut, on warm autumn eves,
        The fragrance of your warmer breast respire,
        I see a country bathed in solar fire
        Whose happy shores its lustre never leaves;
        An isle of indolence, where nature raises
        Singular trees and fruits both sweet and tender,
        Where men have bodies vigorous and slender
        And women's eyes a candour that amazes.
        Led by your scent to fairer climes at last,
        I see a port of sails, where every mast
        Seems weary of the labours of its cruise;
        While scents of tamarind, blown here and there,
        Swelling my nostrils as they rinse the air,
        Are mingled with the chanties of the crews.
                                 XXIII
                               _Her Hair_
        O fleece that down her nape rolls, plume on plume!
        O curls! O scent of nonchalance and ease!
        What ecstacy! To populate this room
        With memories it harbours in its gloom,
        I'd shake it like a banner on the breeze.
        Hot Africa and languid Asia play
        (An absent world, defunct, and far away)
        Within that scented forest, dark and dim.
        As other souls on waves of music swim,
        Mine on its perfume sails, as on the spray.
        I'll journey there, where man and sap-filled tree
        Swoon in hot light for hours. Be you my sea,
        Strong tresses! Be the breakers and gales
        That waft me. Your black river holds, for me,
        A dream of masts and rowers, flames and sails.
        A port, resounding there, my soul delivers
        With long deep draughts of perfumes, scent, and clamour,
        Where ships, that glide through gold and purple rivers,
        Fling wide their vast arms to embrace the glamour
        Of skies wherein the heat forever quivers.
        I'll plunge my head in it, half drunk with pleasure--
        In this black ocean that engulfs her form.
        My soul, caressed with wavelets there may measure
        Infinite rockings in embalmÃ¨d leisure,
        Creative idleness that fears no storm!
        Blue tresses, like a shadow-stretching tent,
        You shed the blue of heavens round and far.
        Along its downy fringes as I went
        I reeled half-drunken to confuse the scent
        Of oil of coconuts, with musk and tar.
        My hand forever in your mane so dense,
        Rubies and pearls and sapphires there will sow,
        That you to my desire be never slow--
        Oasis of my dreams, and gourd from whence
        Deep-draughted wines of memory will flow.
                                  XXIV
        More than night's vault, it's you that I adore,
        Vessel of sorrow, silent one, the more
        Because you flee from me, and seem to place,
        Ornament of my nights! more leagues of space
        Ironically between me and you
        Than part me from these vastitudes of blue.
        I charge, attack, and mount to the assault
        As worms attack a corpse within a vault.
        And cherish even the coldness that you boast,
        By which, harsh beast, you subjugate me most.
                                  XXV
        You'd stick the world into your bedside lane.
        It's boredom makes you callous to all pain.
        To exercise your teeth for this strange task,
        A heart upon a rake, each day, you'd ask.
        Your eyes lit up like shopfronts, or the trees
        With lanterns on the night of public sprees,
        Make insolent misuse of borrowed power
        And scorn the law of beauty that's their dower.
        Oh deaf-and-dumb machine, harm-breeding fool
        World sucking leech, yet salutary tool!
        Have you not seen your beauties blanch to pass
        Before their own reflection in the glass?
        Before this pain, in which you think you're wise,
        Does not its greatness shock you with surprise,
        To think that Nature, deep in projects hidden,
        Has chosen you, vile creature of the midden,
        To knead a genius for succeeding time.
        O sordid grandeur! Infamy sublime!

                           _Sed non Satiata_
        Strange goddess, brown as evening to the sight,
        Whose scent is half of musk, half of havanah,
        Work of some obi, Faust of the Savanah,
        Ebony witch, and daughter of the night.
        By far preferred to troth, or drugs, or sleep,
        Love vaunts the red elixir of your mouth.
        My caravan of longings seeks in drouth
        Your eyes, the wells at which my cares drink deep.
        Through those black eyes, by which your soul respires,
        Pitiless demon! pour less scorching fires.
        I am no Styx nine times with flame to wed.
        Nor can I turn myself to Proserpine
        To break your spell, Megera libertine!
        Within the dark inferno of your bed.
                                 XXVII
        With waving opalescence in her gown,
        Even when she walks along, you think she's dancing.
        Like those long snakes which charmers, while entrancing,
        Wave with their wands, in cadence, up and down.
        Like the sad sands of deserts and their skies,
        By human sufferings untouched and free,
        Or like the surfy curtains of the sea,
        She flaunts a cold indifference. Her eyes
        Are made of charming minerals well-burnished.
        Her nature, both by sphynx and angel furnished,
        Is old, intact, symbolic, and bizarre:
        She seems, made all of gems, steel, light, and gold,
        In barrenness, majestic, hard, and cold,
        To blaze forever, like a useless star.

                        _The Snake that Dances_
        I love to watch, while you are lazing,
          Your skin. It iridesces
        Like silk or satin, smoothly-glazing
          The light that it caresses.
        Under your tresses dark and deep
          Where acrid perfumes drown,
        A fragrant sea whose breakers sweep
          In mazes blue or brown,
        My soul, a ship, to the attraction
          Of breezes that bedizen
        Its swelling canvas, clears for action
          And seeks a far horizon.
        Your eyes where nothing can be seen
          Either of sweet or bitter
        But gold and iron mix their sheen,
          Seem frosty gems that glitter.
        To see you rhythmically advancing
          Seems to my fancy fond
        As if it were a serpent dancing
          Waved by the charmer's wand.
        Under the languorous moods that weigh it,
          Your childish head bows down:
        Like a young elephant's you sway it
          With motions soft as down.
        Your body leans upon the hips
          Like a fine ship that laves
        Its hull from side to side, and dips
          Its yards into the waves.
        When, as by glaciers ground, the spate
          Swells hissing from beneath,
        The water of your mouth, elate,
          Rises between your teeth--
        It seems some old Bohemian vintage
          Triumphant, fierce, and tart,
        A liquid heaven that showers a mintage
          Of stars across my heart.
                                  XXIX
                             _The Carcase_
        The object that we saw, let us recall,
        This summer morn when warmth and beauty mingle--
        At the path's turn, a carcase lay asprawl
            Upon a bed of shingle.
        Legs raised, like some old whore far-gone in passion.
        The burning, deadly, poison-sweating mass
        Opened its paunch in careless, cynic fashion,
            Ballooned with evil gas.
        On this putrescence the sun blazed in gold,
        Cooking it to a turn with eager care--
        So to repay to Nature, hundredfold,
            What she had mingled there.
        The sky, as on the opening of a flower,
        On this superb obscenity smiled bright.
        The stench drove at us, with such fearsome power
            You thought you'd swoon outright.
        Flies trumpeted upon the rotten belly
        Whence larvae poured in legions far and wide,
        And flowed, like molten and liquescent jelly,
            Down living rags of hide.
        The mass ran down, or, like a wave elated
        Rolled itself on, and crackled as if frying:
        You'd think that corpse, by vague breath animated,
            Drew life from multiplying.
        Through that strange world a rustling rumour ran
        Like rushing water or a gust of air,
        Or grain that winnowers, with rhythmic fan,
            Sweep simmering here and there.
        It seemed a dream after the forms grew fainter,
        Or like a sketch that slowly seems to dawn
        On a forgotten canvas, which the painter
            From memory has drawn.
        Behind the rocks a restless cur that slunk
        Eyed us with fretful greed to recommence
        His feast, amidst the bonework, on the chunk
            That he had torn from thence.
        Yet you'll resemble this infection too
        One day, and stink and sprawl in such a fashion,
        Star of my eyes, sun of my nature, you,
            My angel and my passion!
        Yes, you must come to this, O queen of graces,
        At length, when the last sacraments are over,
        And you go down to moulder in dark places
            Beneath the grass and clover.
        Then tell the vermin as it takes its pleasance
        And feasts with kisses on that face of yours,
        I've kept intact in form and godlike essence
            Our decomposed amours!
                                  XXX
                         _De Profundis Clamavi_
        Have pity, my one love and sole delight!
        Down to a dark abyss my heart has sounded,
        A mournful world, by grey horizons bounded,
        Where blasphemy and horror swim by night.
        For half the year a heatless sun gives light,
        The other half the night obscures the earth.
        The arctic regions never knew such dearth.
        No woods, nor streams, nor creatures meet the sight.
        No horror in the world could match in dread
        The cruelty of that dire sun of frost,
        And that huge night like primal chaos spread.
        I envy creatures of the vilest kind
        That they in stupid slumber can be lost--
        So slowly does the skein of time unwind!

                             _The Vampire_
        You, who like a dagger ploughed
        Into my heart with deadly thrill:
        You who, stronger than a crowd
        Of demons, mad, and dressed to kill,
        Of my dejected soul have made
        Your bed, your lodging, and domain:
        To whom I'm linked (Unseemly Jade!)
        As is a convict to his chain,
        Or as the gamester to his dice,
        Or as the drunkard to his dram,
        Or as the carrion to its lice--
        I curse you. Would my curse could damn!
        I have besought the sudden blade
        To win for me my freedom back.
        Perfidious poison I have prayed
        To help my cowardice. Alack!
        Both poison and the sword disdained
        My cowardice, and seemed to say
        `You are not fit to be unchained
        From your damned servitude. Away,
        You imbecile! since if from her empire
        We were to liberate the slave,
        You'd raise the carrion of your vampire,
        By your own kisses, from the grave.`
                                 XXXII
        One night when, near a fearful Jewess lying,
        As one corpse by another corpse, I sprawled--
        Beside the venal body I was buying,
        The beauty that was absent I recalled.
        I pictured you in native majesty
        With glances full of energy and grace,
        Your hair, a perfumed casque, whose memory
        Revives me for the amorous embrace.
        For madly I'd have kissed your noble frame,
        And from your cool feet to your great black tresses
        Unleashed the treasure of profound caresses,
        If with a single tear that gently came
        You could have quenched, O queen of all the cruel!
        The blazing of your eyes, their icy fuel.

                          _Posthumous Remorse_
        When you're asleep, dear shadow-coloured wench,
        Within a coal-black, marble monument:
        When, for your room and mansion, you are pent
        In a wet cellar and a hollow trench:
        When the stone, pressing on your startled breast
        And flanks in fluent suppleness competing,
        Prevents your heart from wishing or from beating,
        Your feet from racing on their reckless quest.
        The tomb that shares my deathless recollection
        (For poets best are understood by tombs)
        On those long nights, when never sleep presumes,
        Will say, `What boots, frail vase of imperfection,
        Not to have known what pains with death begin?`--
        And, like remorse, the worm will gnaw your skin.
                                 XXXIV
                               _The Cat_
        Come, my fine cat, against my loving heart;
        Sheathe your sharp claws, and settle.
        And let my eyes into your pupils dart
        Where agate sparks with metal.
        Now while my fingertips caress at leisure
        Your head and wiry curves,
        And that my hand's elated with the pleasure
        Of your electric nerves,
        I think about my woman--how her glances
        Like yours, dear beast, deep-down
        And cold, can cut and wound one as with lances;
        Then, too, she has that vagrant
        And subtle air of danger that makes fragrant
        Her body, lithe and brown.
                                  XXXV
                                 _Duel_
        Two fighters rushed together: sabres bleak
        With crimson blood-gouts lit the air above.
        That clinking swordplay was the tender squeak
        Of youth, when it's a prey to bleating love.
        The swords are splintered, like our youth, my darling,
        And now it's teeth and talons are the fashion.
        The clash of swords is child's play to the snarling
        Of hearts adult in ulcerated passion.
        In the ravine by lynx and leopard haunted,
        Our heroes, wrestling heroes, roll undaunted.
        Rags of their skin flower red upon the gorse.
        This gulf is hell, and peopled by our friends.
        Here, hellcat! Come, let's roll without remorse
        To celebrate a feud that never ends!

                             _The Balcony_
        Mother of memories, queen of paramours,
        Yourself are all my pleasure, all my duty;
        You will recall caresses that were yours
        And fireside evenings in their warmth and beauty.
        Mother of memories, queen of paramours.
        On eves illumined by the light of coal,
        The balcony beneath a rose-veiled sky,
        Your breast how soft! Your heart how good and whole!
        We spoke eternal things that cannot die--
        On eves illumined by the light of coal!
        How splendid sets the sun of a warm evening!
        How deep is space! the heart how full of power!
        When, queen of the adored, towards you leaning,
        I breathed the perfume of your blood in flower.
        How splendid sets the sun of a warm evening!
        The evening like an alcove seemed to thicken,
        And as my eyes astrologised your own,
        Drinking your breath, I felt sweet poisons quicken,
        And in my hands your feet slept still as stone.
        The evening like an alcove seemed to thicken.
        I know how to resuscitate dead minutes.
        I see my past, its face hid in your knees.
        How can I seek your languorous charm save in its
        Own source, your heart and body formed to please.
        I know how to resuscitate dead minutes.
        These vows, these perfumes, and these countless kisses,
        Reborn from gulfs that we could never sound,
        Will they, like suns, once bathed in those abysses,
        Rejuvenated from the deep, rebound--
        These vows, these perfumes, and these countless kisses?

                            _The Possessed_
        The sun in crÃªpe has muffled up his fire.
        Moon of my life! Half shade yourself like him.
        Slumber or smoke. Be silent and be dim,
        And in the gulf of boredom plunge entire;
        I love you thus! However, if you like,
        Like some bright star from its eclipse emerging,
        To flaunt with Folly where the crowds are surging--
        Flash, lovely dagger, from your sheath and strike!
        Light up your eyes from chandeliers of glass!
        Light up the lustful looks of louts that pass!
        Morbid or petulant, I thrill before you.
        Be what you will, black night or crimson dawn;
        No fibre of my body tautly-drawn,
        But cries: `Beloved demon, I adore you!`

                               The Shades
        My fate confines me, dark and shady,
        In vaults of lone unfathomed grief.
        No rosy sunbeams bring relief.
        Alone with Night, my grim landlady,
        I'm like a painter whom God spites
        To paint on shades, and cook and eat
        My own poor heart, the only meat
        Of my funereal appetites.
        Sometimes a spectre dim, reclining
        In grace and glory, can be seen.
        With dreamy oriental mien.
        When fully its own form defining,
        I recognise who it must be,
        Sombre yet luminous, it's She!

                              The Perfume
        Reader, say, have you ever breathed,
        With lazy greed and joy, the dusk
        Of an old church with incense wreathed,
        Or smelt an ancient bag of musk?
        It's by such charms the Nevermore
        Intoxicates us in the Now--
        As lovers to Remembrance bow
        Over the bodies they adore.
        From her thick tresses as they fume
        (Scent-sack and censer of the room)
        A feline, tawny perfume springs.
        Her muslins and her velvets smooth
        Give off, made pregnant with her youth,
        Scents of the fur of prowling things.

                               The Frame
        As a fine frame improves a plate
        Although the graver needs no vaunting--
        I know not what of strange and haunting
        (From nature vast to isolate
        Her beauty) was conferred by gems,
        Metals, and gear. She mingled with them,
        And swirled them all into her rhythm
        As in her skirts the flouncing hems.
        They say she thought all things were stung
        With love for her. Her naked flesh
        She loved to drown in kisses fresh
        Of flax or satin. To her clung,
        In all the movements of her shape,
        The childish graces of the ape.

                              The Portrait
        Sickness and death will form the ash and dust
        Of all the fire we blazed with in such splendour,
        Of those great eyes so fervent and so tender,
        The mouth wherein my heart would drown its lust,
        The kisses strong as marum, the delightful,
        Fierce transports livelier than the solar rays.
        What can remain? My soul, the truth is frightful!--
        A fading sketch, a faint three-coloured haze,
        Which (like myself unfriended) wanes away,
        While Time, insulting dotard, every day,
        Brushes it fainter with his heedless wing . . .
        Killer of life and art! black, evil King!--
        You'll never kill, within my soul, the story
        Of that which was my rapture and my glory.

        For you this poem: if my name should reach
        Favoured by mighty gales, to far-off times,
        Like a proud vessel sailing to the beach,
        To stir the brains of humans with my rhymes--
        Your memory, uncertain as a myth,
        Will tire the reader like an endless gong,
        And be a mystic, kindred chain wherewith
        He'll hang suspended to my towering song:
        Curs'd soul to whom (from the supernal sky
        To hell's abysm) none responds but I!--
        O you, who like a fleeting shadow pass,
        Spurn with light foot and with serenest gaze
        The stupid mortals who have grudged you praise,
        O jade-eyed statue, angel browed with brass!

                             _Semper Eadem_
        `Whence,` ask you, `does this strange new sadness flow
        Like rising tides on rocks, black, bare, and vast?`
        For human hearts, when vintage-time is past,
        To live is bad. That secret all men know--
        An obvious sorrow, with no mystery, shown,
        Clear as your joy, to everyone around.
        O curious one, seek nothing more profound,
        And speak not, though your voice be sweet in tone.
        Hush, ignorant! Hush, soul that's still enraptured,
        And mouth of childish laughter! Neatly captured,
        Death pulls us, more than life, with subtle wile.
        Oh let my thought get drunk upon a lie,
        And plunge, as in a dream, in either eye,
        And in their lashes' shadow sleep awhile!

                              _All in One_
        The Demon called on me this morning,
        In my high room. As is his way,
        Thinking to catch me without warning,
        He put this question: `Tell me, pray,
        Of all the beauties that compose,
        The strange enchantment of her ways,
        Amongst the wonders black or rose,
        Which object most excites your praise,
        And is the climax in her litany?`
        My soul, you answered the Abhorred,
        `Since she is fashioned, all, of dittany,
        No part is most to be adored.
        Since I am ravished, I ignore a
        Degree of difference in delight.
        She dazzles me like the aurora
        And she consoles me like the night.
        The harmony's so exquisite
        That governs her, it is in vain
        Analysis would try to split
        The unity of such a strain.
        O mystic fusion that, enwreathing
        My senses, fuses each in each,
        To hear the music of her breathing
        And breathe the perfume of her speech.`
                                  XLII
        What can you say, poor lonely soul of mine,
        Or you, poor heart, so long ago turned sour,
        To the best, dearest, loveliest, whose divine
        Regard has made you open like a flower?
        We'll set our pride to sing her highest praise:
        Naught to her sweet authority compares:
        Her psychic flesh is formed of fragrant airs.
        Her glances clothe us in a suit of rays.
        Be it in solitude at dead of night,
        Or in the crowded streets of glaring light,
        Her phantom like a torch before me streams.
        It speaks: `I'm beautiful. These orders take.
        Love naught but Beauty, always, for my sake,
        Madonna, guardian Angel, Muse of dreams.`
                                 XLIII
                           _The Living Torch_
        Those lit eyes go before me, in full view,
        (Some cunning angel magnetised their light)--
        Heavenly twins, yet my own brothers too,
        Shaking their diamond blaze into my sight.
        My steps from every trap or sin to save,
        In the strait road of Beauty they conduct me.
        They are my servants, and I am their slave,
        Obedient in whatever they instruct me.
        Delightful eyes, you burn with mystic rays
        Like candles in broad day; red suns may blaze,
        But cannot quench their still, fantastic light.
        Those candles burn for death, but you for waking:
        You sing the dawn that in my soul is breaking,
        Stars which no sun could ever put to flight!

        Angel of gaiety, have you known anguish,
        Shame and remorse, tears, boredom, and dismay,
        Vague horrors of the nights in which we languish,
        Which crumple hearts like papers thrown away?
        Angel of gaiety, have you known anguish?
        Angel of kindness, have you met with hate?
        Fists clenched in gloom, eyes running tears of gall,
        When Vengeance beats his drum to subjugate
        Our faculties, the captain of them all?
        Angel of kindness, have you met with hate?
        Angel of health, have you beheld the Fevers?
        Across pale walls of wards they limp and stumble,
        Like exiles wan, with agues, chills, and shivers,
        Seeking the scanty sun with lips that mumble.
        Angel of health, have you beheld the Fevers?
        Angel of beauty, do you know Old Age,
        The fear of wrinkles, and the dire emotion,
        In eyes we've pierced too long, as on a page,
        To read the secret horror of devotion?
        Angel of beauty do you know Old Age?
        Angel of goodness, radiance, and delight,
        The dying David would have begged to share
        The emanations of your body bright.
        But all I wish to ask of you is prayer,
        Angel of goodness, radiance, and delight.
                                  XLV
                              _Confession_
        Once, and once only, kind and gentle lady,
        Your polished arm on mine you placed
        (Deep down within my spirit, dark and shady,
        I keep the memory uneffaced).
        A medal, newly-coined, of flashing silver,
        The full moon shone. The night was old.
        Its solemn grandeur, like a mighty river,
        Through sleeping Paris softly rolled.
        Along the streets, by courtyard doors, cats darted
        And passed in furtive, noiseless flight
        With ears pricked; or, like shades of friends departed,
        Followed us slowly through the night.
        Cutting this easy intimacy through,
        That hatched from out that pearly light--
        O rich resounding instrument, from you,
        Who'd always thrilled with loud delight,
        From you, till then as joyful as a peal
        Of trumpets on a sparkling morn,
        A cry so plaintive that it seemed unreal,
        Was staggeringly torn.
        Like some misborn, deformed, and monstrous kid
        Who puts his family to the blush,
        Whose presence in a cellar must be hid
        And his existence in a hush!
        Poor angel! that harsh note was meant to sing
        `That nothing in this world is certain,
        And human egotism is the thing
        Which all existence serves to curtain.
        That it's an irksome task to be a beauty,
        A boring job one has to face--
        Like frigid dancers, smiling as a duty
        With hard, mechanical grimace:
        That building upon hearts is idiotic:
        All cracks, love, beauty, and fraternity
        Until Oblivion puts them in his pocket
        To pawn them on to old Eternity!`
        I often have recalled that moon of magic,
        That languid hush on quays and marts,
        And then this confidence, so grim and tragic,
        In the confessional of hearts.

                            _Spiritual Dawn_
        When in the company of the Ideal
        (That gnawing tooth) Dawn enters, white and pink,
        The rooms of rakes--each sated beast can feel
        An Angel waking through the fumes of drink.
        For downcast Man, who dreams and suffers still,
        The azure of the mystic heaven above,
        With gulf-like vertigo, attracts his will.
        So, Goddess, lucid Being of pure love,
        Over the smoking wreck of feasts and scandals,
        Your phantom, rosy and enchanting, flies
        And still returns to my dilated eyes.
        The sun has blackened out the flame of candles.
        So your victorious phantom seems as one,
        O blazing spirit, with the deathless Sun!
                                 XLVII
                           _Evening Harmony_
        Now comes the eve, when on its stem vibrates
        Each flower, evaporating like a censer;
        When sounds and scents in the dark air grow denser;
        Drowsed swoon through which a mournful waltz pulsates!
        Each flower evaporates as from a censer;
        The fiddle like a hurt heart palpitates;
        Drowsed swoon through which a mournful waltz pulsates;
        The sad, grand sky grows, altar-like, immenser.
        The fiddle, like a hurt heart, palpitates,
        A heart that hates oblivion, ruthless censor.
        The sad, grand sky grows, altar-like, immenser.
        The sun in its own blood coagulates . . .
        A heart that hates oblivion, ruthless censor.
        The whole of the bright past resuscitates.
        The sun in its own blood coagulates . . .
        And, monstrance-like, your memory flames intenser!
                                 XLVIII
                              _The Flask_
        Perfumes there are which through all things can pass
        And make all matter porous, even glass;
        Old coffers from the Orient brought, whose locks
        Grind sullenly when opening the box,
        Or, in an empty house, some ancient chest,
        Where time and dust and gloom were long compressed,
        May yield a flask where memory survives,
        And a soul flashes into future lives.
        A thousand thoughts, funereal larvae, laid
        Shuddering softly under palls of shade,
        May suddenly their soaring wings unfold,
        Stained azure, glazed with rose, or filmed with gold.
        Intoxicating memory now flies
        Into the dusk, and makes us close our eyes:
        Vertigo draws the spirit which it grips
        Towards some dark miasma of eclipse:
        Beside an ancient pit he makes her fall,
        Where Lazarus, sweet-scented, tears his pall
        And wakes the spectral corpse of some now-cold,
        Rancid, sepulchral love he knew of old.
        So when I'm lost to human memory, thrown
        In some old gloomy chest to lie alone,
        A poor decrepit flask, cracked, abject, crusty
        With dirt, opaque and sticky, damp and dusty,
        I'll be your pall and shroud, beloved pest!
        The witness of your venom, and its test,
        Dear poison, angel-brewed with deadly art--
        Life, death, and dear corrosion of my heart.
                                  XLIX
                               _Poisons_
        Wine can conceal a sordid room
          In rich, miraculous disguise,
        And make such porticoes arise
          Out of its flushed and crimson fume
        As makes the sunset in the skies.
        Opium the infinite enlarges,
          And lengthens all that is past measure.
        It deepens time, and digs its treasure.
          With sad, black raptures it o'ercharges
        The soul, and surfeits it with pleasure.
        Neither are worth the drug so strong
          That you distil from your green eyes,
        Lakes where I see my soul capsize
          Head downwards: and where, in one throng,
        I slake my dreams, and quench my sighs.
        But to your spittle these seem naught--
          It stings and burns. It steeps my thought
        And spirit in oblivious gloom,
          And, in its dizzy onrush caught,
        Dashes it on the shores of doom.

                              _Misty Sky_
        One would have thought your eyes were veiled in haze,
        Strange eyes! (Grey, green, or azure is their gaze?)
        It seems they would reflect, in each renewal,
        The changing skies, dull, dreamy, fond, or cruel.
        You know those days both warm and hazy, which
        Melt into tears the hearts that they bewitch:
        And when the nerves, uneasy to control,
        Too-wide awake, upbraid the sleeping soul.
        You, too, resemble such a lit horizon
        As suns of misty seasons now bedizen . . .
        As you shine out, a landscape fresh with rain
        With misty sunbeams sparkling on the plain.
        Dangerous girl, seductive as the weather!
        Shall I adore your snows and frosts together?
        In your relentless winter shall I feel
        A kiss more sharp than that of ice and steel?
                                   LI
                               _The Cat_
                                   I
        A fine strong gentle cat is prowling
        As in his bedroom, in my brain;
        So soft his voice, so smooth its strain,
        That you can scarcely hear him miowling.
        But should he venture to complain
        Or scold, the voice is rich and deep:
        And thus he manages to keep
        The charm of his untroubled reign.
        This voice, which seems to pearl and filter
        Through my soul's inmost shady nook,
        Fills me with poems, like a book,
        And fortifies me, like a philtre.
        His voice can cure the direst pain
        And it contains the rarest raptures.
        The deepest meanings, which it captures,
        It needs no language to explain.
        There is no bow that can so sweep
        That perfect instrument, my heart:
        Or make more sumptuous music start
        From its most vibrant cord and deep,
        Than can the voice of this strange elf,
        This cat, bewitching and seraphic,
        Subtly harmonious in his traffic
        With all things else, and with himself.
                                   2
        So sweet a perfume seems to swim
        Out of his fur both brown and bright,
        I nearly was embalmed one night
        From (only once) caressing him.
        Familiar Lar of where I stay,
        He rules, presides, inspires and teaches
        All things to which his empire reaches.
        Perhaps he is a god, or fay.
        When to a cherished cat my gaze
        Is magnet-drawn and then returns
        Back to itself, it there discerns,
        With strange excitement and amaze,
        Deep down in my own self, the rays
        Of living opals, torch-like gleams
        And pallid fire of eyes, it seems,
        That fixedly return my gaze.

                          _The Splendid Ship_
        Oh soft enchantress, I'll record with truth
        The diverse beauties that adorn your youth.
          Yes, I will paint your charm
        Of womanhood with childhood arm in arm.
        When you go sweeping your wide skirts, to me
        You seem a splendid ship that out to sea
          Spreads its full sails, and with them
        Goes rolling in a soft, slow, lazy rhythm.
        Over your tall, round neck and those plump shoulders,
        Your head swans forth its pride to all beholders,
          With grace triumphant, mild,
        And strange, you go your way, majestic child.
        Oh soft enchantress, I'll record with truth
        The diverse beauties that adorn your youth.
          Yes, I will paint your charm
        Of womanhood with childhood arm in arm.
        Your bosom juts and stretches every stitch,
        Triumphant bosom, like a coffer rich
          With bosses round and rare,
        Like shields that draw the lightning from the air.
        Provoking shields, with rosy points uplifted!
        Coffer of secret charms, superbly gifted,
          Whose scents, liqueurs, and wine
        Turn heart and brain deliriously thine.
        When you go sweeping your wide skirts, to me
        You seem a splendid ship that out to sea
          Spreads its full sails, and with them
        Goes rolling in a soft, slow, lazy rhythm.
        Your noble thighs, beneath the silks they swirl,
        Torment obscure desires and tease me, girl;
          Like sorcerers they are
        That stir black philtres in a deep, cool jar.
        Your arms precocious Hercules would grace
        And vie with pythons in their bright embrace:
          The pressure they impart
        Would print your lovers' image on your heart.
        Over your tall, round neck and those plump shoulders,
        Your head swans forth its pride to all beholders,
          With grace triumphant, mild,
        And strange, you go your way, majestic child.

        My daughter, my sister,
        Consider the vista
        Of living out there, you and I.
        To love at our leisure,
        Then, ending our pleasure,
        In climes you resemble to die.
        There the suns, rainy-wet,
        Through clouds rise and set
        With the selfsame enchantment to charm me
        That my senses receive
        From your eyes, that deceive,
        When they shine through your tears to disarm me.
        There'll be nothing but beauty, wealth, pleasure,
        With all things in order and measure.
        With old treasures furnished,
        By centuries burnished,
        To gleam in the shade of our chamber.
        While the rarest of flowers
        Vaguely mix through the hours
        Their own with the perfume of amber:
        Each sumptuous ceiling,
        Each mirror revealing
        The wealth of the East, will be hung
        So the part and the whole
        May speak to the soul
        In its native, indigenous tongue.
        There'll be nothing but beauty, wealth, pleasure,
        With all things in order and measure.
        On the channels and streams
        See each vessel that dreams
        In its whimsical vagabond way,
        Since its for your least whim
        The oceans they swim
        From the ends of the night and the day.
        The sun, going down,
        With its glory will crown
        Canals, fields, and cities entire,
        While the whole earth is rolled
        In the jacinth and gold
        Of its warming and radiant fire.
        There'll be nothing but beauty, wealth, pleasure,
        With all things in order and measure.

                           _The Irreparable_
        How can we choke the old and long Remorse
          Which lives, and squirms, and fights
        And feeds on us as worms upon a corse,
          Or, on the oak, its mites?
        How can we choke the old and long Remorse?
        What subtle philtre, wine, or drowsy draught
          Will drown that ancient foe,
        Greedy as whores in his disastrous craft,
          Ant-patient, sure, and slow?
        What subtle philtre, wine or drowsy draught?
        Lovely enchantress, if you know it, say
          To this soul whelmed with woes,
        Dying, whom loads of wounded crush to clay
          Under the horses' shoes:
        Lovely enchantress, if you know it, say
        To this poor moribund, while wolves yet stalk him
          And ravens croak his doom,
        To this spent soldier say if fate will baulk him
          Even of a cross or tomb--
        Say to this moribund, while wolves yet stalk him!
        Can this black muddy sky be ever lighted,
          The shades be ever torn,
        Denser than pitch, to day and dusk benighted,
          To lightning, stars, or morn?
        Can this black muddy sky be ever lighted?
        The candle Hope that shows the Inn to strangers
          Is blown out, snuffed, and melted.
        Lacking both moon and glimmer, how shall rangers
          Of evil roads be sheltered?
        The devil snuffed the light that burned for strangers.
        Sweet witch, do you love spirits lost to grace?
          Whose sins are not remitted?
        Say, do you know Remorse, with venomed face,
          By whom our hearts are spitted?
        Sweet witch, do you love spirits lost to grace?
        The Irreparable gnaws us where it lurks
          And for our soul's defacement,
        As on a monument the termite, works
          Up from the very basement.
        The Irreparable gnaws us where it lurks.
        In tawdry theatres I've sometimes seen
          How, to the blare of brasses,
        Miraculous, to light some hellish scene,
          Like dawn, a fairy passes;
        In tawdry theatres I've often seen
        That by this fay of light, and gold, and gauzes,
          Some monstrous fiend is slain.
        But my heart knows no raptures or applauses--
          A fleapit where, in vain,
        One waits, and waits the creature winged with gauzes.

                             _Conversation_
        You're like an autumn sky, rose, clear, and placid.
        But sorrow whelms me, like the tide's assault,
        And ebbing, leaves upon my lips the acid
        And muddy-bitter memory of its salt.
        Your hand may stroke my breast, but not console.
        What it seeks there is but a hole, deep caverned
        By women's claws and fangs, and ransacked whole.
        Seek not my heart, on which the beasts have ravened.
        My heart's a palace plundered by the rabble:
        They tope, they kill, in blood and guts they scrabble:--
        --A perfume swims around your naked breast!
        O Beauty, flail of spirits, you know best!
        With your eyes' fire, lit up as for a spree,
        Char the poor rags those beasts have left of me!

        Soon into frozen shades, like leaves, we'll tumble.
        Adieu, short summer's blaze, that shone to mock.
        I hear already the funereal rumble
        Of logs, as on the paving-stones they shock.
        Winter will enter in my soul to dwell--
        Rage, hate, fear, horror, labour forced and dire!
        My heart will seem, to sun that polar hell,
        A dim, red, frozen block, devoid of fire.
        Shuddering I hear the heavy thud of fuel.
        The building of a gallows sounds as good!
        My spirit, like a tower, reels to the cruel
        Battering-ram in every crash of wood.
        The ceaseless echoes rock me and appal.
        They're nailing up a coffin, I'll be bound,
        For whom?--Last night was Summer. Here's the Fall.
        There booms a farewell volley in the sound.
                                   II
        I like the greenish light in your long eyes,
        Dear: but today all things are sour to me.
        And naught, your hearth, your boudoir, nor your sighs
        Are worth the sun that glitters on the sea.
        Yet love me, tender heart, as mothers cherish
        A thankless wretch. Lover or sister, be
        Ephemeral sweetness of the suns that perish
        Or glory of the autumn swift to flee.
        Brief task! The charnel yawns in hunger horrid,
        Yet let me with my head upon your knees,
        Although I mourn the summer, white and torrid
        Taste these last yellow rays before they freeze.

                       (Ex Voto in Spanish Style)
        I'd build, Madonna, love, for my belief,
        An altar in the dim crypt of my grief,
        And in the darkest corner of my heart,
        From mortal lust and mockery far apart,
        Scoop you a niche, with gold and azure glaze,
        Where you would stand in wonderment and gaze,
        With my pure verses trellised, and all round
        In constellated rhymes of crystal bound:
        And with a huge tiara richly crowned.
        Out of the Jealousy which rules my passion,
        Mortal Madonna, I a cloak would fashion,
        Barbarous, stiff, and heavy with my doubt,
        Whereon as in a fourm you would fill out
        And mould your lair. Of tears, not pearls, would be
        The sparkle of its rich embroidery:
        Your robe would be my lust, with waving flow,
        Poising on tips, in valleys lying low,
        And clothing, in one kiss, coral and snow.
        In my Respect (for satin) you'ld be shod
        Which your white feet would humble to the clod,
        While prisoning their flesh with tender hold
        It kept their shape imprinted like a mould.
        If for a footstool to support your shoon,
        For all my art, I could not get the moon,
        I'd throw the serpent, that devours my vitals
        Under your trampling heels for his requitals,
        Victorious queen, to spurn, bruise, and belittle
        That monstrous worm blown-up with hate and spittle.
        Round you my thoughts like candles should be seen
        Around the flowered shrine of the virgins' Queen,
        Reflected on a roof that's painted blue,
        And aiming all their golden eyes at you.
        Since nought is in me that you do not stir,
        All will be incense, benjamin, and myrrh,
        And up to you, white peak, in clouds will soar
        My stormy soul, in rapture, to adore.
        In fine, your role of Mary to perfect
        And mingle barbarism with respect--
        Of seven deadly sins, O black delight!
        Remorseful torturer, to show my sleight,
        I'll forge and sharpen seven deadly swords
        And like a callous juggler on the boards,
        Taking it for my target, I would dart
        Them deep into your streaming, sobbing heart.
                                 LVIII
                          _Song of Afternoon_
        Though your eyebrows' wicked slant
        Give you an intriguing air
        Which the angels do not share
        Sorceress, whose eyes enchant--
        My passion, terrible yet gay,
        With all my heart I bow before you,
        With that devotion to adore you
        That priests to sacred idols pay.
        Deserts and woods embalmed your hair,
        Its movements give your head the stigma
        Of sphinx-like secret and enigma,
        Both in its attitude and air.
        As round a censer vapours form,
        About your flesh the perfumes wander.
        The selfsame charms you seem to squander
        As does an evening, dark yet warm,
        The strongest philtres cannot craze
        As does your indolent address
        And you have mastered a caress
        Dead corpses from their tombs to raise.
        Your hips are amorous of your breast
        And of your back: your languorous pose
        Enchants the cushions where you doze
        When in their depths you make your nest.
        Sometimes in order to appease
        Mysterious rages in your soul,
        You bite and kiss without control.
        Then with a mocking laugh you tease
        My heart, brown beauty, tearing it:
        Then over it the light is strewn
        Of your eye, softer than the moon,
        Till with its glance my soul is lit.
        Underneath your satin shoes,
        And underneath your silken feet,
        My joy, my fate, my genius meet
        To strew the pathway of my muse.
        My soul is healed, restored and made complete
        By you, all colour, warmth, and light,
        in my Siberia a bright
        Explosion as of tropic heat.

                                _Sisina_
        Picture Diana, gallantly arrayed,
        Ranging the woods, elated with the chase,
        With flying hair and naked breasts displayed,
        Defying fleetest horsemen with her pace.
        Know you Theroigne whom blood and fire exalt,
        Hounding a shoeless rabble to the fray,
        Up royal stairways heading the assault,
        And mounting, sword in hand, to show the way?
        Such is Sisina. Terrible her arms.
        But charity restrains her killing charms.
        Though rolling drums and scent of powder madden
        Her courage,--laying by its pikes and spears,
        For those who merit, her scorched heart will sadden,
        And open, in its depth, a well of tears.

                      _Praises of my Francisca_[1]
               (Verses to a learned and devout Millener)
        Upon new chords of you I sing.
        And the new-born bud you bring
        From solitude, the pure heart's Spring.
        Your brows should be with garlands twined,
        Woman of delightful mind,
        Who our trespasses unbind.
        As the wondrous balm of Lethe,
        Through thy kisses, I will breathe thee.
        All are magnetised who see thee.
        When my vices, wild and stormy,
        From my wonted courses bore me
        It was You appeared before me,
        Star of Oceans! you that alter
        Courses, when the pilots falter--
        Take my heart upon your altar.
        Cistern full of virtuous ruth,
        Fountain of eternal youth,
        Give to dumbness speech and truth!
        What was dirty, you cremated,
        What uneven--you equated,
        What was weak you re-created.
        Inn, on the hungry roads I tramp,
        And, in the dark, a guiding lamp
        To steer the lost one back to camp.
        To my strength add strength, O sweet
        Bath, where scents and unguents meet!
        Anoint me for some peerless feat!
        Holy water most seraphic,
        On the lusts in which I traffic
        Flash your chastity ecstatic.
        Bowl of gems where radiance dances.
        Salt that the holy bread enhances,
        And sacred wine--your name is Frances!

                          _To a Colonial Lady_
        In scented countries by the sun caressed
        I've known, beneath a tent of purple boughs,
        And palmtrees shedding slumber as they drowse,
        A creole lady with a charm unguessed.
        She's pale, and warm, and duskily beguiling;
        Nobility is moulded in her neck;
        Slender and tall she holds herself in check,
        An huntress born, sure-eyed, and quiet-smiling.
        Should you go, Madam, to the land of glory
        Along the Seine or Loire, where you would merit
        To ornament some mansion famed in story,
        Your eyes would burn in those deep-shaded parts,
        And breed a thousand rhymes in poets' hearts,
        Tamed like the negro slaves that you inherit.
                                  LXII
                         _Moesta et Errabunda_
        Agatha, does your heart rise up and fly,
        Far from the city's black and sordid sea
        Towards a sea that's blue as any sky,
        And clear and deep as pure virginity?
        Agatha, does your heart rise up and fly?
        The sea, the mighty sea, consoles our labour.
        What demon taught the sea with raucous verse
        To choir the organ which the winds belabour
        And lullaby our sorrows like a nurse?
        The sea, the mighty sea, consoles our labour.
        Train, bear me; take me, ship, to other climes!
        Far, far! For here the mud is made of tears.
        --Does Agatha's sad heart not say, at times,
        `Far from remorses, sorrows, crimes, and fears,
        Train, bear me; take me, ship, to other climes`?
        How distant is that perfumed paradise!
        Where all is joy and love with azure crowned,
        Where all one loves is truly worth the price,
        And hearts in pure voluptuousness are drowned.
        How distant is that perfumed paradise!
        But the green paradise of childish love,
        Of races, songs, and kisses, and bouquets,
        Of fiddles shrilling in the hills above,
        And jars of wine, and woods, and dying rays--
        But the green paradise of childish love,
        Innocent paradise of furtive joys,
        Is it far off as India or Hong Kong?
        Could it be conjured by a plaintive voice
        Or animated by a silver song--
        That far off paradise of furtive joys?
                                 LXIII
                              _The Ghost_
        Like angels fierce and tawny-eyed,
        Back to your chamber I will glide,
        And noiselessly into your sight
        Steal with the shadows of the night.
        And I will bring you, brown delight,
        Kisses as cold as lunar night
        And the caresses of a snake
        Revolving in a grave. At break
        Of morning in its livid hue,
        You'd find I had bequeathed to you
        An empty place as cold as stone.
        Others by tenderness and ruth
        Would reign over your life and youth,
        But I would rule by fear alone.
                                  LXIV
                            _Autumn Sonnet_
        Your eyes like crystal ask me, clear and mute,
        `In me, strange lover, what do you admire?`
        Be lovely: hush: my heart, whom all things tire
        Except the candour of the primal brute,
        Would hide from you the secret burning it
        And its black legend written out in fire,
        O soother of the sleep that I respire!
        Passion I hate, and I am hurt by wit.
        Let us love gently. In his lair laid low,
        Ambushed in shades, Love strings his fatal bow.
        I know his ancient arsenal complete,
        Crime, horror, lunacy--O my pale daisy!
        Are we not suns in Autumn, silver-hazy,
        O my so white, so snow-cold Marguerite?
                                  LXV
                          _Sorrow of the Moon_
        More drowsy dreams the moon tonight. She rests
        Like a proud beauty on heaped cushions pressing,
        With light and absent-minded touch caressing,
        Before she sleeps, the contour of her breasts.
        On satin-shimmering, downy avalanches
        She dies from swoon to swoon in languid change,
        And lets her eyes on snowy visions range
        That in the azure rise like flowering branches.
        When sometimes to this earth her languor calm
        Lets streak a stealthy tear, a pious poet,
        The enemy of sleep, in his cupped palm,
        Takes this pale tear, of liquid opal spun
        With rainbow lights, deep in his heart to stow it
        Far from the staring eyeballs of the Sun.
                                  LXVI
                                 _Cats_
        Sages austere and fervent lovers both,
        In their ripe season, cherish cats, the pride
        Of hearths, strong, mild, and to themselves allied
        In chilly stealth and sedentary sloth.
        Friends both to lust and learning, they frequent
        Silence, and love the horror darkness breeds.
        Erebus would have chosen them for steeds
        To hearses, could their pride to it have bent.
        Dreaming, the noble postures they assume
        Of sphinxes stretching out into the gloom
        That seems to swoon into an endless trance.
        Their fertile flanks are full of sparks that tingle,
        And particles of gold, like grains of shingle,
        Vaguely be-star their pupils as they glance.
                                 LXVII
                               _The Owls_
        Within the shelter of black yews
        The owls in ranks are ranged apart
        Like foreign gods, whose eyeballs dart
        Red fire. They meditate and muse.
        Without a stir they will remain
        Till, in its melancholy hour,
        Thrusting the level sun from power,
        The shade establishes its reign.
        Their attitude instructs the sage,
        Content with what is near at hand,
        To shun all motion, strife, and rage.
        Men, crazed with shadows that they chase,
        Bear, as a punishment, the brand
        Of having wished to change their place.
                                 LXVIII
                          _The Author's Pipe_
        I am an author's pipe. To see me
        And my outlandish shape to heed,
        You'd know my master was a dreamy
        Inveterate smoker of the weed.
        When he is loaded down with care,
        I like a stove will smoke and burn
        Wherein the supper they prepare
        Against the labourer's return.
        I nurse his spirit with my charm
        Swaying it in a soft, uncertain,
        And vaguely-moving azure curtain.
        I roll a potent cloud of balm
        To lull his spirit into rest
        And cure the sorrows in his breast.
                                  LXIX
                                _Music_
        Music uplifts me like the sea and races
          Me to my distant star,
        Through veils of mist or through ethereal spaces,
          I sail on it afar.
        With chest flung out and lungs like sails inflated
          Into the depth of night
        I escalade the backs of waves serrated,
          That darkness veils from sight.
        I feel vibrating in me the emotions
          That storm-tossed ships must feel.
        The fair winds and the tempests and the oceans
          Sway my exultant keel.
        Sometimes a vast, dead calm with glassy stare
          Mirrors my dumb despair.
                                  LXX
                    _The Burial of an Accursed Poet_
        If on a night obscure and deep,
        Some decent Christian, out of ruth,
        Buries behind some garbage-heap
        The vaunted body of your youth:
        There, when the chaster stars have set
        And the moon her hammock slung
        Will the spider weave his net
        And the adder hatch her young.
        Your cursÃ¨d head beneath the ground
        Will hear, through all the seasons then,
        The dismal cries of wolves resound,
        Old half-starved witches raising spooks,
        The antics of obscene old men,
        And black conspiracies of crooks.
                                  LXXI
                         _Fantastic Engraving_
        A monstrous spectre carries on his forehead,
        And at a rakish tilt, grotesquely horrid,
        A crown such as at carnivals parade.
        Without a whip or spur he rides a jade,
        A phantom-like apocalyptic moke,
        Whose nostrils seem with rabid froth to smoke.
        Across unbounded space the couple moves
        Spurning infinity with reckless hooves.
        The horseman waves a sword that lights the gloom
        Of nameless crowds he tramples to their doom,
        And, like a prince his mansion, goes inspecting
        The graveyard, which, no skyline intersecting,
        Contains, beneath a sun that's white and bleak,
        Peoples of history, modern and antique.
                                 LXXII
                           _The Joyous Dead_
        In a fat, greasy soil, that's full of snails,
        I'll dig a grave deep down, where I may sleep
        Spreading my bones at ease, to drowse in deep
        Oblivion, as a shark within the wave.
        I hate all tombs, and testaments, and wills:
        I want no human tears; I'd like it more,
        That ravens could attack me with their bills,
        To broach my carcase of its living gore.
        O worms! black friends, who cannot hear or see,
        A free and joyous corpse behold in me!
        You philosophic souls, corruption-bred,
        Plough through my ruins! eat your merry way!
        And if there are yet further torments, say,
        For this old soulless corpse among the dead.
                                 LXXIII
                           _The Cask of Hate_
        The Cask of the pale DanaÃ¯ds is Hate.
        Vainly Revenge, with red strong arms employed,
        Precipitates her buckets, in a spate
        Of blood and tears, to feed the empty void.
        The Fiend bores secret holes to these abysms
        By which a thousand years of sweat and strain
        Escape, though she'd revive their organisms
        In order just to bleed them once again.
        Hate is a drunkard in a tavern staying,
        Who feels his thirst born of its very cure,
        Like Lema's hydra, multiplied by slaying.
        Gay drinkers of their conqueror are sure,
        And Hate is doomed to a sad fate, unable
        Ever to fall and snore beneath the table.
                                 LXXIV
                           _The Cracked Bell_
        It's sweet and bitter, of a winter night,
        To hear, beside the crackling, smoking log,
        Far memories prepare themselves for flight
        To carillons that sound amid the fog.
        Happy's the bell whose vigorous throat on high,
        In spite of time, is sound and still unspent,
        To hurl his faithful and religious cry
        Like an old soldier watching in his tent.
        My soul is cracked, and when amidst its care
        It tries with song to fill the frosty air,
        Sometimes, its voice seems like the feeble croak
        A wounded soldier makes, lost in the smoke,
        Beneath a pile of dead, in bloody mire,
        Trying, with fearful efforts, to expire.
                                  LXXV
                                _Spleen_
        The Month of Rains, incensed at life, outpours
        Out of her urn, a dark chill, like a penance,
        Over the graveyards and their wan, grey tenants
        And folk in foggy suburbs out of doors.
        My cat seeks out a litter on the ground
        Twitching her scrawny body flecked with mange.
        The soul of some old poet seems to range
        The gutter, with a chill phantasmal sound.
        The big bell tolls: damp hearth-logs seem to mock,
        Whistling, the sniffle-snuffle of the clock,
        While in the play of odours stale with must,
        Reminders of a dropsical old crone,
        The knave of hearts and queen of spades alone
        Darkly discuss a passion turned to dust.
                                 LXXVI
                                _Spleen_
        I have more memories than had I seen
        Ten centuries. A huge chest that has been
        Stuffed full of writs, bills, verses, balance-sheets
        With golden curls wrapt up in old receipts
        And love-letters--hides less than my sad brain,
        A pyramid, a vault that must contain
        More corpses than the public charnel stores.
        I am a cemetery the moon abhors,
        Where, like remorses, the long worms that trail
        Always the dearest of my dead assail.
        I am a boudoir full of faded roses
        Where many an old outmoded dress reposes
        And faded pastels and pale Bouchers only
        Breathe a scent-flask, long-opened and left lonely . . .
        Nothing can match those limping days for length
        Where under snows of years, grown vast in strength,
        Boredom (of listlessness the pale abortion)
        Of immortality takes the proportion!
        --From henceforth, living matter, you are nought
        But stone surrounded by a dreadful thought:
        Lost in some dim Sahara, an old Sphinx,
        Of whom the world we live in never thinks.
        Lost on the map, it is its surly way
        Only to sing in sunset's fading ray.

                                _Spleen_
        I'm like the King of some damp, rainy clime,
        Grown impotent and old before my time,
        Who scorns the bows and scrapings of his teachers
        And bores himself with hounds and all such creatures.
        Naught can amuse him, falcon, steed, or chase:
        No, not the mortal plight of his whole race
        Dying before his balcony. The tune,
        Sung to this tyrant by his pet buffoon,
        Irks him. His couch seems far more like a grave.
        Even the girls, for whom all kings seem brave,
        Can think no toilet up, nor shameless rig,
        To draw a smirk from this funereal prig.
        The sage who makes him gold, could never find
        The baser element that rots his mind.
        Even those blood-baths the old Romans knew
        And later thugs have imitated too,
        Can't warm this skeleton to deeds of slaughter,
        Whose only blood is Lethe's cold, green water.

                                _Spleen_
        When the cold heavy sky weighs like a lid
        On spirits whom eternal boredom grips,
        And the wide ring of the horizon's hid
        In daytime darker than the night's eclipse:
        When the world seems a dungeon, damp and small,
        Where hope flies like a bat, in circles reeling,
        Beating his timid wings against the wall
        And dashing out his brains against the ceiling:
        When trawling rains have made their steel-grey fibres
        Look like the grilles of some tremendous jail,
        And a whole nation of disgusting spiders
        Over our brains their dusty cobwebs trail:
        Suddenly bells are fiercely clanged about
        And hurl a fearsome howl into the sky
        Like spirits from their country hunted out
        Who've nothing else to do but shriek and cry--
        Then long processions without fifes or drums
        Wind slowly through my soul. Hope, weeping, bows
        To conquest. And atrocious Anguish comes
        To plant his black flag on my drooping brows.

                              _Obsession_
        You forests, like cathedrals, are my dread:
        You roar like organs. Our curst hearts, like cells
        Where death forever rattles on the bed,
        Echo your _de Profundis_ as it swells.
        My spirit hates you, Ocean! sees, and loathes
        Its tumults in your own. Of men defeated
        The bitter laugh, that's full of sobs and oaths,
        Is in your own tremendously repeated.
        How you would please me, Night! without your stars
        Which speak a foreign dialect, that jars
        On one who seeks the void, the black, the bare.
        Yet even your darkest shade a canvas forms
        Whereon my eye must multiply in swarms
        Familiar looks of shapes no longer there.

                       _The Thirst for the Void_
        My soul, you used to love the battle's rumble.
        Hope, whose sharp spur once kindled you like flame,
        Will mount on you no more. Rest, without shame,
        Old charger, since at every step you stumble.
        Sleep now the sleep of brutes, proud heart: be humble.
        O broken raider, for your outworn mettle,
        Love has no joys, no fight is worth disputing.
        Farewell to all the trumpeting and fluting!
        Pleasure, have done, when brooding shadows settle,
        The blooms of spring are vanquished by the nettle.
        As snows devour stiff corpses in their welter,
        Time wolfs my soul in, minute after minute.
        I've seen the world and everything that's in it,
        And I no longer seek in it for shelter;
        Come, Avalanche! and sweep me helter-skelter.

        One puts all nature into mourning,
        One lights her like a flaring sun--
        What whispers `Burial` to the one
        Cries to the other, `Life and Morning`.
        The unknown Hermes who assists
        The role of Midas to reverse,
        And makes me by a subtle curse
        The saddest of all alchemists--
        By him, my paradise to hell,
        And gold to slag, is changed too well.
        The clouds are winding-sheets, and I,
        Bidding some dear-loved corpse farewell,
        Along the shore-line of the sky,
        Erect my vast sarcophagi.

                          _Sympathetic Horror_
        From livid skies that, without end,
        As stormy as your future roll,
        What thoughts into your empty soul
        (Answer me, libertine!) descend?
        --Insatiable yet for all
        That turns on darkness, doom, or dice.
        I'll not, like Ovid, mourn my fall,
        Chased from the Latin paradise.
        Skies, torn like seacoasts by the storm!
        In you I see my pride take form,
        And the huge clouds that rush in streams
        Are the black hearses of my dreams,
        And your red rays reflect the hell,
        In which my heart is pleased to dwell.

                              TO J. G. F.
        I'll strike you, but without the least
        Anger--as butchers poll an ox,
        Or Moses, when he struck the rocks--
        That from your eyelid thus released,
        The lymph of suffering may brim
        To slake my desert of its drought.
        So my desire, by hope made stout,
        Upon your salty tears may swim,
        Like a proud ship, far out from shore.
        Within my heart, which they'll confound
        With drunken joy, your sobs will sound
        Like drums that beat a charge in war.
        Am I not a faulty chord
        In all this symphony divine.
        Thanks to the irony malign
        That shakes and cuts me like a sword?
        It's in my voice, the raucous jade!
        It's in my blood's black venom too!
        I am the looking-glass, wherethrough
        Megera sees herself portrayed!
        I am the wound, and yet the blade!
        The smack, and yet the cheek that takes it!
        The limb, and yet the wheel that breaks it,
        The torturer, and he who's flayed!
        One of the sort whom all revile,
        A Vampire, my own blood I quaff,
        Condemned to an eternal laugh
        Because I know not how to smile.

                                   I.
        A Form, Idea, or Essence, chased
        Out of the azure sky, and shot
        Into a leaden Styx where not
        A star can pierce the muddy waste:
        An angel, rash explorer, who,
        Tempted by love of strange deformity,
        Caught in a nightmare of enormity,
        Fights like a swimmer, wrestling through
        A monstrous whorl of eddying spume,
        In deathly anguish, from him flinging
        The wave that, like an idiot singing,
        Goes pirouetting through the gloom:
        A wretch enchanted, who, to flee
        A den of serpents, gropes about
        In desperation vain, without
        Discovering a match or key:
        A damnÃ¨d soul, who, with no lamp,
        Stands by a gulf, whose humid scent
        Betrays the depth of the descent
        Of endless stairs without a ramp,
        Where slimy monsters watch the track
        Whose eyeballs phosphoresce and glow
        Only to make the night more black
        And nought except themselves to show:
        A vessel that the pole betrays,
        Caught in a crystal trap all round,
        And seeking by what fatal sound
        It ever entered such a maze:--
        Clear emblems! measuring the level
        Of irremediable dooms,
        Which make us see how well the Devil
        Performs whatever he presumes!

        Strange _tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte_! the heart, its own
        Mirror, its own confession hears!
        Deep well where Truth is trembling shown
        And like a livid star appears,
        Ironic beacon and infernal
        Torch of satanic grace, but still
        Sole glory and relief eternal,

                              _The Clock_
        The Clock, calm evil god, that makes us shiver,
        With threatening finger warns us each apart:--
        `_Remember!_ Soon the vibrant woes will quiver,
        Like arrows in a target, in your heart.
        To the horizon Pleasure will take flight
        As flits a vaporous sylphide to the wings.
        Each instant gnaws a crumb of the delight
        That for his season every mortal brings.
        Three thousand times and more, each hour, the second
        Whispers '_Remember!_' Like an insect shrill
        The present chirps, 'With Nevermore I'm reckoned.
        I've pumped your lifeblood with my loathsome bill.'
        _Remember! Souviens-toi! Esto Memor!_
        My brazen windpipe speaks in every tongue.
        Each moment, foolish mortal, is like ore
        From which the precious metal must be wrung.
        _Remember._ Time the gamester (it's the law)
        Wins always, without cheating. Daylight wanes.
        Night deepens. The abyss with gulfy maw
        Thirsts on unsated, while the hour-glass drains.
        Sooner or later, now, the time must be
        When Hazard, Virtue (your still-virgin mate),
        Repentance, (your last refuge), or all three--
        Will tell you, 'Die, old Coward. It's too late!'`

                            _The Landscape_
        More chasteness to my eclogues it would give,
        Sky-high, like old astrologers to live,
        A neighbour of the belfries: and to hear
        Their solemn hymns along the winds career.
        High in my attic, chin in hand, I'd swing
        And watch the workshops as they roar and sing.
        The city's masts--each steeple, tower, and flue--
        And skies that bring eternity to view.
        Sweet, through the mist, to see illumed again
        Stars through the azure, lamps behind the pane,
        Rivers of carbon irrigate the sky,
        And the pale moon pour magic from on high.
        I'd watch three seasons passing by, and then
        When winter came with dreary snows, I'd pen
        Myself between closed shutters, bolts, and doors,
        And build my fairy palaces indoors.
        A dream of blue horizons I would garble
        With thoughts of fountains weeping on to marble,
        Of gardens, kisses, birds that ceaseless sing,
        And all the Idyll holds of childhood's spring.
        The riots, brawling past my window-pane,
        From off my desk would not divert my brain.
        Because I would be plunged in pleasure still.
        Conjuring up the Springtime with my will,
        And forcing sunshine from my heart to form,
        Of burning thoughts, an atmosphere that's warm.

        When the sun strikes, redoubling waves of heat
        On town, and field, and roof, and dusty street--
        I prowl to air my prowess and kill time,
        Stalking, in likely nooks, the odds of rhyme,
        Tripping on words like cobbles as I go
        And bumping into lines dreamed long ago.
        This all-providing Sire, foe to chloroses,
        Wakes verses in the fields as well as roses
        Evaporates one's cares into the breeze,
        Filling with honey brains and hives of bees,
        Rejuvenating those who go on crutches
        And bringing youthful joy to all he touches,
        Life to those precious harvests he imparts
        That grow and ripen in our deathless hearts.
        Poet-like, through the town he seems to smile
        Ennobling fate for all that is most vile;
        And king-like, without servants or display,
        Through hospitals and mansions makes his way.

                      _The Red-Haired Beggar Girl_
        White girl with flame-red hair,
        Whose garments, here and there,
        Give poverty to view,
            And beauty too.
        To me, poor puny poet,
        Your body, as you show it,
        With freckles on your arms,
            Has yet its charms.
        You wear with prouder mien
        Than in Romance a queen
        Her velvet buskins could--
            Your clogs of wood.
        In place of tatters short
        Let some rich robe of court
        Swirl with its silken wheels
            After your heels:
        In place of stockings holed
        A dagger made of gold,
        To light the lecher's eye,
            Flash on your thigh:
        Let ribbons slip their bows
        And for our sins disclose
        A breast whose radiance vies
            Even with your eyes.
        To show them further charms
        Let them implore your arms,
        And these, rebuking, humble
            Fingers that fumble
        With preferred pearls aglow
        And sonnets of Belleau,
        Which, fettered by your beauty,
            They yield in duty.
        Riffraff of scullion-rhymers
        Would dedicate their primers
        Under the stairs to view
            Only your shoe.
        Each page-boy lucky-starred,
        Each marquis, each Ronsard
        Would hang about your bower
            To while an hour.
        You'd count, among your blisses,
        Than lilies far more kisses,
        And boast, among your flames,
            Some royal names.
        Yet now your beauty begs
        For scraps on floors, and dregs
        Else destined to the gutter,
            As bread and butter.
        You eye, with longing tense,
        Cheap gauds for thirty cents,
        Which, pardon me, these days
            I cannot raise.
        No scent, or pearl, or stone,
        But nothing save your own
        Thin nudity for dower,
            Pass on, my flower!

                             TO VICTOR HUGO
                                   I.
        Andromache!--This shallow stream, the brief
        Mirror you once so grandly overcharged
        With your vast majesty of widowed grief,
        This lying SimoÃ¯s your tears enlarged.
        Evoked your name, and made me think of you.
        As I was crossing the new Carrousel.
        --Old Paris is no more (cities renew,
        Quicker than human hearts, their changing spell).
        In mind I see that camp of huts, the muddle
        Of rough-hewn roofs and leaning shafts for miles.
        The grass, green logs stagnating in the puddle.
        Where bric-a-brac lay glittering in piles.
        Once a menagerie parked there. And there
        It chanced one morning, when from slumber freed,
        Labour stands up, and Transport through still air
        Rumbles its sombre hurricane of speed.--
        A swan escaped its cage: and as its feet
        With finny palms on the harsh pavement scraped,
        Trailing white plumage on the stony street,
        In the dry gutter for fresh water gaped.
        Nervously bathing in the dust, in wonder
        It asked, remembering its native stream,
        `When will the rain come down? When roll the thunder?`
        I see it now, strange myth and fatal theme!
        Sometimes, like Ovid's wretch, towards the sky
        (Ironically blue with cruel smile)
        Its neck, convulsive, reared its head on high
        As though it were its Maker to revile.
                                   II
        Paris has changed, but in my grief no change.
        New palaces and scaffoldings and blocks,
        To me, are allegories, nothing strange.
        My memories are heavier than rocks.
        Passing the Louvre, one image makes me sad:
        That swan, like other exiles that we knew,
        Grandly absurd, with gestures of the mad,
        Gnawed by one craving!--Then I think of you,
        Who fell from your great husband's arms, to be
        A beast of freight for Pyrrhus, and for life,
        Bowed by an empty tomb in ecstacy--
        Great Hector's widow! Helenus's wife!
        I think, too, of the starved and phthisic negress
        Tramping the mud, who seeks, with haggard eye,
        The palms of Africa, and for some egress
        Out of this great black wall of foggy sky:
        Of those who've lost what they cannot recover:
        Of those who slake with tears their lonely hours
        And milk the she-wolf, Sorrow, for their mother:
        And skinny orphans withering like flowers.
        So in the forest of my soul's exile,
        Remembrance winds his horn as on he rides.
        I think of sailors stranded on an isle,
        Captives, and slaves--and many more besides.

                          _The Seven Old Men_
                             TO VICTOR HUGO
        Ant-seething city, city full of dreams,
        Where ghosts by daylight tug the passer's sleeve.
        Mystery, like sap, through all its conduit-streams,
        Quickens the dread Colossus that they weave.
        One early morning, in the street's sad mud,
        Whose houses, by the fog increased in height,
        Seemed wharves along a riverside in flood:
        When with a scene to match the actor's plight,
        Foul yellow mist had filled the whole of space:
        Steeling my nerves to play a hero's part,
        I coaxed my weary soul with me to pace
        The backstreets shaken by each lumbering cart.
        A wretch appeared whose tattered, yellow clothing,
        Matching the colour of the raining skies,
        Could make it shower down alms--but for the loathing
        Malevolence that glittered in his eyes.
        The pupils of his eyes, with bile injected,
        Seemed with their glance to make the frost more raw.
        Stiff as a sword, his long red beard projected,
        Like that of Judas, level with his jaw.
        He was not bent, but broken, with the spine
        Forming a sharp right-angle to the straight,
        So that his stick, to finish the design,
        Gave him the stature and the crazy gait
        Of a three-footed Jew, or crippled hound.
        He plunged his soles into the slush as though
        To crush the dead; and to the world around
        Seemed less of an indifferent than a foe.
        His image followed him, (back, stick, and beard
        In nothing differed) spawned from the same hole,
        A centenarian twin. Both spectres steered
        With the same gait to the same unknown goal.
        To what foul plot was I exposed? of what
        Humiliating hazard made the jeer?
        For seven times, (I counted) was begot
        This sinister, self multiplying fear!
        Let him mark well who laughs at my despair
        With no fraternal shudder in reply . . .
        Those seven loathsome monsters had the air,
        Though rotting through, of what can never die.
        Disgusting Phoenix, his own sire and father!
        Could I have watched an eighth instalment spawn
        Ironic, fateful, grim--nor perished rather?
        But from that hellish _cortÃ¨ge_ I'd withdrawn.
        Perplexed as drunkards when their sight is doubled,
        I locked my room, sick, fevered, chilled with fright:
        With all my spirit sorely hurt and troubled
        By so ridiculous yet strange a sight.
        Vainly my reason for the helm was striving:
        The tempest of my efforts made a scorn.
        My soul like a dismasted wreck went driving
        Over a monstrous sea without a bourn.

                         _The Little Old Women_
                             TO VICTOR HUGO
                                   I
        In sinuous folds of cities old and grim,
        Where all things, even horror, turn to grace,
        I follow, in obedience to my whim,
        Strange, feeble, charming creatures round the place.
        These crooked freaks were women in their pride,
        Fair Eponine or LaÃ¯s! Humped and bent,
        Love them! Because they still have souls inside.
        Under their draughty skirts in tatters rent,
        They crawl: a vicious wind their carrion rides;
        From the deep roar of traffic see them cower,
        Pressing like precious relics to their sides
        Some satchel stitched with mottoes or a flower.
        They trot like marionettes along the level,
        Or drag themselves like wounded deer, poor crones!
        Or dance, against their will, as if the devil
        Were swinging in the belfry of their bones.
        Cracked though they are, their eyes are sharp as drills
        And shine, like pools of water in the night,--
        The eyes of little girls whom wonder thrills
        To laugh at all that sparkles and is bright.
        The coffins of old women very often
        Are near as small as those of children are.
        Wise Death, who makes a symbol of a coffin
        Displays a taste both charming and bizarre.
        And when I track some feeble phantom fleeing
        Through Paris's immense ant-swarming Babel,
        I always think that such a fragile being
        Is moving softly to another cradle.
        Unless, sometimes, in geometric mood,
        To see the strange deformities they offer,
        I muse how often he who saws the wood
        Must change the shape and outline of the coffer.
        Those eyes are wells a million teardrops feed,
        Crucibles spangled by a cooling ore,
        Invincible in charm to all that breed
        Austere Misfortune suckled with her lore.
                                   II
        Vestal whom old Frascati could enamour:
        Thalia's nun, whose name was only known
        To her dead prompter: madcap full of glamour
        Whom Tivoli once sheltered as its own--
        They all elate me. But of these a few,
        Of sorrow having made a honeyed leaven,
        Say to Devotion, `Lend me wings anew,
        O powerful Hippogriff, and fly to heaven.`
        One for her fatherland a martyr: one
        By her own husband wronged beyond belief:
        And one a pierced Madonna through her son--
        They all could make a river with their grief.
                                  III
        Yes, I have followed them, time and again!
        One, I recall, when sunset, like a heart,
        Bled through the sky from wounds of ruddy stain,
        Pensively sat upon a seat apart,
        To listen to the music, rich in metal,
        That's played by bands of soldiers in the parks
        On golden, soul-reviving eves, to fettle,
        From meek civilian hearts, heroic sparks.
        This one was straight and stiff, in carriage regal,
        She breathed the warrior-music through her teeth,
        Opened her eye like that of an old eagle,
        And bared a forehead moulded for a wreath.
                                   IV
        Thus, then, you journey, uncomplaining, stoic
        Across the strife of modern cities flung,
        Sad mothers, courtesans, or saints heroic,
        Whose names of old were heard on every tongue,
        You once were grace, and you were glory once.
        None know you now. Derisory advances
        Some drunkard makes you, mixed with worse affronts.
        And on your heels a child-tormentor prances.
        But I who watch you tenderly: and measure
        With anxious eye, your weak unsteady gait
        As would a father--get a secret pleasure
        On your account, as on your steps I wait.
        I see your passionate and virgin crazes;
        Sombre or bright, I see your vanished prime;
        My soul, resplendent with your virtue, blazes,
        And revels in your vices and your crimes.
        Poor wrecks! My family! Kindred in mind, you
        Receive from me each day my last addresses.
        Eighty-year Eves, will yet tomorrow find you
        On whom the claw of God so fiercely presses?

                              _The Blind_
        My soul, survey them, dreadful as they seem.
        Like marionettes, ridiculous they stare.
        Strange as somnambulists that, in their dream,
        Dart shadowy orbs around we know not where.
        Their eyes, from which the heavenly spark has flown,
        Remain uplifted, as in distant quest,
        Skyward: but never on the paving stone
        Do they pore dreamingly or come to rest.
        They traverse thus the illimitable Dark,
        Twin of eternal Silence. While the City
        May sing around us, bellow, laugh, or bark,--
        By pleasure blinded even to horror, I,
        Too, drag my way, but, more a thing of pity,
        Ask what the Blind are seeking there on high.

                             _A Passer-by_
        The deafening street roared on. Full, slim, and grand
        In mourning and majestic grief, passed down
        A woman, lifting with a stately hand
        And swaying the black borders of her gown;
        Noble and swift, her leg with statues matching;
        I drank, convulsed, out of her pensive eye,
        A livid sky where hurricanes were hatching,
        Sweetness that charms, and joy that makes one die.
        A lighting-flash--then darkness! Fleeting chance
        Whose look was my rebirth--a single glance!
        Through endless time shall I not meet with you?
        Far off! too late! or never!--I not knowing
        Who you may be, nor you where I am going--
        You, whom I might have loved, who know it too!

        Quaint anatomic plates are sold
        Along the quays in third-hand stalls
        Where tomes cadaverous and old
        Slumber like mummies in their palls.
        In them the craftsman's skill combines
        With expert knowledge in a way
        That beautifies these chill designs
        Although the subject's far from gay.
        One notes that, consummating these
        Mysterious horrors, God knows how,
        Skeletons and anatomies
        Peel off their skins to delve and plough.

        Navvies, funereal and resigned,
        From the tough ground with which you tussle
        With all the effort that can find
        Filleted spine or skinless muscle--
        O grave-snatched convicts, say what strange
        Harvest you hope from such a soil
        And who the farmer is whose grange
        You would replenish with this toil.
        Mean you to show (O evil-starred
        Exponents of too stark a doom)
        The promised sleep may yet be barred,
        Even from us, beyond the tomb;
        That even extinction may turn traitor,
        And Death itself, can be a lie;
        And that perhaps, sooner or later,
        Forever, when we come to die,
        In some strange country, without wages,
        On stubborn outcrops delving holes,
        We'll push a shovel through the ages
        Beneath our flayed and blinding soles?

                           _Evening Twilight_
        Delightful evening, partner of the crook,
        Steals in, wolf-padded, like a complice: look:
        Heaven, like a garret, closes to the day,
        And Man, impatient, turns a beast of prey.
        Sweet evening, loved by those whose arms can tell.
        Without a lie, `Today we've laboured well:`
        Sweet evening, it is she who brings relief
        To men with souls devoured by one fierce grief,
        Obstinate thinkers drowsy in the head,
        And toil-bent workmen groping to their bed.
        But insalubrious demons of the airs,
        Like business people, wake to their affairs
        And, flying, knock, like bats, on walls and shutters.
        Now Prostitution lights up in the gutters
        Across the glimmering jets the wind torments.
        Like a huge ant-hive it unseals its vents.
        On every side it weaves its hidden tracks
        Like enemies preparing night-attacks.
        It squirms within the City's breast of mire,
        A worm that steals the food that men desire.
        One hears the kitchens hissing here and there,
        Operas squealing, orchestras ablare.
        Cheap _tables d'hÃ´te_, where gaming lights the eyes,
        Fill up with whores, and sharpers, their allies:
        And thieves, whose office knows no truce nor rest,
        Will shortly now start working, too, with zest,
        Gently unhinging doors and forcing tills,
        To live some days and buy their sweethearts frills.
        Collect yourself, my soul, in this grave hour
        And shut your ears against the din and stour.
        It is the hour when sick men's pains increase.
        Death grips them by the throat, and soon they cease
        Their destined task, to find the common pit.
        The ward is filled with sighings. Out of it
        Not all return the scented soup to taste,
        Warm at the hearthside, by some loved-one placed.
        But then how few among them can recall
        Joys of the hearth, or ever lived at all!

                             _The Gamblers_
        In faded armchairs, harlots of past years
        Pale, with false eyebrows, wheedling, fatal eyes,
        And weird, affected airs, clink from thin ears
        A feeble sound, where tin with crystal vies.
        Round the green tables, faces without lips,
        Lips without colour, jaws their teeth surviving.
        And fingers which a hellish fever grips
        Convulsively in breasts and pockets diving
        Under the dirty ceiling, lustres flame
        And chandeliers, that blaze without remittance
        On shady brows of poets dear to fame,
        Who come to waste their sorely-sweated pittance.
        Such was the picture, in nocturnal dreaming,
        I saw unfurled to my clairvoyant eye.
        In that grim vault, one form on elbows leaning,
        Unspeaking, cold, and envious--was I!--
        Yes! envying, for their all-tenacious passion,
        These raddled tarts in their funereal glee,
        Who trafficked there, in such a merry fashion,
        Dead virtue and lost beauty on the spree.
        My heart was chilled with fear at envying
        Wretches who, headlong, rush to be destroyed,
        And, drunk with their own blood, seek anything--
        Hell, death, or torture--rather than the Void!

                          TO ERNEST CHRISTOPHE
        Proud, as a living person, of her height,
        Her scarf and gloves and huge bouquet of roses,
        She shows such nonchalance and ease as might
        A thin coquette excessive in her poses.
        Who, at a ball, has seen a form so slim?
        Her sumptuous skirts extravagantly shower
        To a dry foot that, exquisitely trim,
        Her footwear pinches, dainty as a flower.
        The frills that rub her collarbone, and feel,
        Like a lascivious rill against a rock,
        The charms she is so anxious to conceal,
        Defend them, too, from ridicule and mock.
        Her eyes are formed of emptiness and shade.
        Her skull, with flowers so deftly decked about,
        Upon her dainty vertebrae is swayed.
        Oh what a charm when nullity tricks out!
        `Caricature`, some might opine, but wrongly,
        Whose hearts, too drunk with flesh that runs to waste,
        Ignore the grace of what upholds so strongly.
        Tall skeleton, you match my dearest taste!
        Come you to trouble with your strong grimace,
        The feast of life? Or has some old desire
        Rowelled your living carcase from its place
        And sent you, credulous, to feed its fire?
        With tunes of fiddles and the flames of candles,
        Hope you to chase the nightmare far apart,
        Or with a flood of orgies, feasts, and scandals
        To quench the hell that's lighted in your heart?
        Exhaustless well of follies and of faults,
        Of the old woe the alembic and the urn,
        Around your trellised ribs, in new assaults,
        I see the insatiable serpent turn.
        I fear your coquetry's not worth the strain,
        The prize not worth the effort you prolong.
        Could mortal hearts your railleries explain?
        The joys of horror only charm the strong.
        The pits of your dark eyes dread fancies breathe,
        And vertigo. Among the dancers prudent,
        Hope not your sixteen pairs of smiling teeth
        Will ever find a contemplative student.
        Yet who's not squeezed a skeleton with passion?
        Nor ravened with his kisses on the meat
        Of charnels. What of costume, scent, or fashion?
        The man who feigns disgust, betrays conceit.
        O noseless geisha, unresisted gouge!
        Tell these fastidious feigners, from your husk--
        `Proud fondling fools, in spite of talc and rouge,
        You smell of death. Anatomies of musk,
        Withered AntinoÅ«ses, beaux of dunder,
        Corpses in varnish, Lovelaces of bone,
        The dance of death, with universal thunder,
        Is whirling you to places yet unknown!
        From Seine to Ganges frolicking about,
        You see not, through a black hole in the ceiling.
        Like a great blunderbus, with funnelled snout.
        The Angel's trumpet, on the point of pealing.
        In every clime, Death studies your devices
        And vain contortions, laughable Humanity,
        And oft, like you, perfumes herself with spices
        Mixing her irony with your insanity!`

                             _Love of Lies_
        Dear indolent, I love to watch you so,
        While on the ceiling break the tunes of dances,
        And hesitant, harmoniously slow,
        You turn the wandering boredom of your glances.
        I watch the gas-flares colouring your drawn,
        Pale forehead, which a morbid charm enhances,
        Where evening lamps illuminate a dawn
        In eyes as of a painting that entrances:
        And then I say, `She's fair and strangely fresh,
        Whom memory crowns with lofty towers above.
        Her heart is like a peach's murdered flesh,
        Or like her own, most ripe for learned love.`
        Are you an autumn fruit of sovereign flavour?
        A funeral urn awaiting tearful showers?
        Of far oases the faint, wafted savour?
        A dreamy pillow? or a sheaf of flowers?
        I have known deep, sad eyes that yet concealed
        No secrets: caskets void of any gem:
        Medallions where no sacred charm lay sealed,
        Deep as the Skies, but vacuous like them!
        It is enough that your appearance flatters,
        Rejoicing one who flies from truth or duty.
        Your listless, cold stupidity--what matters?
        Hail, mask or curtain, I adore your beauty!

        Neighbouring on the city, I recall
        Our snow-white house, so full of peace and small:
        The casts of Venus and Pomona too
        Whose limbs a tiny thicket hid from view.
        The sun at eve, cascading fire and gold,
        Behind the glass, his sheaf of rays unrolled,
        Then, like an eye, inquisitively seemed
        To watch our long, hushed dinners as we dreamed;
        Like candle-flames his glories, as they poured,
        Lit our serge curtains and our simple board.

        Now the great-hearted servant, who aroused
        Your jealousy, in humble earth is housed,
        Let's take, at least, some flowers for her relief.
        The dead, the piteous dead, know piercing grief,
        And when October blows, to prune old trees,
        And whistles round the marble where they freeze,
        How thankless then we living must appear
        Between warm sheets to sleep in comfort here,
        While, eaten by black dreams, they lie in woe
        Warm bedmates and their gossip to forego,
        Frostbitten skeletons, tunneled by vermin,
        To bear the moulting drip of Winter's ermine.
        For ages, with no friends nor kindred there
        The tatters on their railings to repair.
        On evenings when the hearth-logs hiss and flare
        Were I to see her calmly take her chair:
        Or, in the calm and blue December gloom,
        Huddle within the corner of my room,
        Gravely returning from her bed eternal
        To tend this grown-up child with the maternal
        Care of old times--how could I then reply
        To see the tears roll from each hollow eye?

        O Autumns, Winters, Springs! Seasons of mire!
        Soul-drowsing times! I love you. Take my praise
        For shrouding thus my heart and brain entire
        In a vague tomb and winding-sheet of haze.
        Through the long nights when the south-wester swings
        The rusty vanes that shriek upon the towers,
        My soul can fully stretch its raven wings
        More easily than in the warmer hours.
        Nothing is sweeter to funereal hearts
        On whom the frost of ages has been laid--
        Wan seasons, when you queen it round these parts,--
        Than the eternal sight of your pale shade:
        Unless on moonless midnights, pair by pair,
        To lull, upon chance beds, our hearts' despair.

                                   I.
        Of the dread landscape that I saw,
        Where human eyes were never set,
        I still am ravished by the awe
        That, vague and distant, haunts me yet.
        Sleep is of miracles so fain
        That I (O singular caprice!)
        As being formless, could obtain
        That vegetable life should cease.
        A painter, in my genius free,
        I there exulted in the fettle
        Derived from a monotony
        Composed of marble, lymph, and metal.
        Babels of stairways and arcades,
        Endless and topless to behold,
        With ponds, and jets, and steep cascades
        Filling receptacles of gold:
        Ponderous cataracts there swung
        Like crystal curtains, foaming shawls--
        Dazzling and glittering they hung
        Suspended from the metal walls.
        Not trees, but colonnades, enclosed
        Motionless lakes, besides whose shelves
        Gigantic naiades reposed,
        Like women, gazing at themselves.
        Blue sheets of water interlay
        Unnumbered quays of green and rose,
        That stretched a million leagues away
        To where the bounds of space impose.
        'Twas formed of unknown stones that blazed
        And magic waves that intersect,
        Where icebergs floated, seeming dazed
        With all they mirror and reflect.
        Impassive, cold, and taciturn,
        Great Ganges, through the sky's vast prism,
        Each poured the treasures of its urn
        Into a diamond abysm.
        Architect of my fairy scene,
        I willed, by wondrous stratagems,
        An ocean, tamed, to pass between
        A tunnel that was made of gems.
        There all things, even the colour black.
        Seemed irridescently to play,
        And liquid crystalised its lack
        Of outline in a frozen ray.
        No star, no sun could be discerned,
        Even low down, in that vast sky:
        The fire was personal that burned
        To show these marvels to the eye.
        Above these moving wonders sheer
        There soared (that such a thing should be!
        All for the eye, none for the ear!)
        A silence of eternity.
                                  II.
        My opening eyes, as red as coal,
        The horror of my lodging met.
        I felt re-entering my soul
        The knife of cares and vain regret.
        The clock with brutal accent played
        Funereal chimes. The time was noon.
        And heaven covered, with its shade,
        The world, this fatuous balloon!

                           _Morning Twilight_
        ReveillÃ© in the barracks and the camps.
        The wind of morning blew upon the lamps.
        It was the hour when evil dreams in swarms
        On pillows twist brown, adolescent forms:
        When like a bleeding eye that's twitched with pain
        Each lantern smudged the day with crimson stain:
        The soul, against its body's weight of brawn,
        Lay struggling, like the lanterns with the dawn:
        Like a sad face whose tears the breezes dry
        The air grew tremulous with things that fly,
        And women tired of love, and men of writing.
        The chimneys, here and there, showed fires were lighting.
        Women of pleasure, slumber to be-slut,
        Lay open-mouthed with livid eyelids shut.
        Dangling thin dugs, cold pauper-women blew
        Upon the embers and their fingers too.
        It was the hour when, what with cold and squalor,
        Women in labour aggravate their dolour,
        And like a sob, choked short with bloody froth,
        The cock-crow tore the foggy air as cloth.
        Like seas the mists round every building poured
        While agonising patients in the ward,
        In broken hiccoughs, rattled out their lives:
        And worn-out rakes reeled homeward to their wives.
        Aurora, in a shift of rose and green,
        Came shivering down the Seine's deserted scene
        And Paris, as he rubbed his eyes, began
        To sort his tools, laborious old man.

                           _The Soul of Wine_
        One night the wine was singing in the bottles:
        `Mankind, dear waif, I send to you, in spite
        Of prisoning glass and rosy wax that throttles,
        A song that's full of brotherhood and light.
        I know what toil, and pain, and sweat you thole,
        Under the roasting sun on slopes of fire,
        To give me life and to beget my soul--
        So I will not be thankless to my sire,
        Because I feel a wondrous joy to dive
        Down, down the throat of some work-wearied slave.
        His warm chest is a tomb wherein I thrive
        Better than in my subterranean cave.
        Say, can you hear that rousing catch resound
        Which hope within my beating heart sings high?
        (With elbows on the table, sprawl around,
        Contented hearts! my name to glorify.)
        I'll light the eyes of your delighted wife.
        Your son I'll give both rosy health and muscle
        And be to that frail athlete of this life
        Like oil that primes the wrestler for the tussle.
        In you I fall, ambrosia from above,
        Sown by the hand of the eternal Power,
        That poetry may blossom from our love
        And rear to God its rare and deathless flower!`

                     _The Wine of the Rag Pickers_
        Often, in some red street-lamp's glare, whose flame
        The wind flaps, rattling at its glassy frame,
        In the mired labyrinth of some old slum
        Where crawling multitudes ferment their scum--
        With judge-like nods, a rag-picker comes reeling,
        Bumping on walls, like poets, without feeling,
        And scorning cops, now vassals of his state,
        Begins on glorious subjects to dilate,
        Takes royal oaths, dictates his laws sublime,
        Exalts the injured, and chastises crime,
        And, spreading his own daÃ¯s on the sky,
        Is dazzled by his virtues, starred on high.
        Yes, these folk, badgered by domestic care,
        Ground down by toil, decrepitude, despair,
        Buckled beneath the foul load that each carries,
        The motley vomit of enormous Paris--
        Come home, vat-scented, trailing clouds of glory,
        Followed by veteran comrades, battle-hoary,
        Whose whiskers stream like banners as each marches.
        --Flags, torches, flowers, and steep triumphal arches
        Rise up for them in magic hues and burn,
        Since through this dazzling orgy they return,
        While drums and clarions daze the sun above,
        With glory to a nation drunk with love!
        Thus Wine, through giddy human life, is rolled,
        Like Pactolus, a stream of burning gold;
        Through man's own throat his exploits it will sing,
        And reign by gifts, as best befits a king.
        To lull their laziness and drown their rancour,
        For storm-tossed wrecks a temporary anchor,
        God, in remorse, made sleep. Man added Wine,
        Child of the Sun, immortal and divine!

                       _The Wine of the Murderer_
        My wife is dead. I'm free. From hence
        I'll drink my fill, and that's the truth!
        Each time I came back with no pence,
        Her screechings drilled me like a tooth.
        Now I'm as happy as a king . . .
        Air pure, a cloudless sky above.
        I can remember such a thing
        The summer that we fell in love.
        To quench the thirst that tears my throat
        It would require the vats to flow
        Enough to set her tomb afloat--
        And that's no thimbleful, oh no!
        I threw her in a well to drown.
        With the walled rocks that round it stood,
        To keep her there, and hold her down--
        I would forget her if I could!
        Pleading our early tender vows,
        Which naught could break for evermore,
        To reconcile us, spouse to spouse,
        In the same raptures as before--
        I begged of her a _rendez-vous_
        One evening in a gloomy lane.
        She came--a crazy thing to do!
        We all are more-or-less insane!
        She still was quite attractive, though
        A little tired and ill: and I
        Still loved her more than ever: so
        I said, `Get out of life, and die!`
        None understand me. Could a single
        `Drunk` of the stupid sort design,
        On morbid nights, by his own ingle,
        To make a winding sheet of wine?
        Of dense invulnerable stuff,
        Like engines built to shunt or shove,
        They've never known, through smooth or rough,
        The veritable power of love,
        Its black enchantments, fiery trials.
        Processions of infernal pains,
        Its burning tears, its poison phials,
        Its rattling bones, and jingling chains.
        Now I am free and all alone.
        To-night I'll get dead-drunk, of course.
        My head I'll pillow on a stone
        Without repentance or remorse.
        And there I'll sleep like any dog.
        The lumbering cart with massive wheels
        Piled up with stones, or peat, or bog,
        Or hurtling wagon, as it reels
        May crush my skull in, like a clod,
        Or halve me at the crossing-level.
        I'd care as little as for God,
        The Ten Commandments, or the Devil.

        All these aren't worth, O bottle kind and deep,
        The penetrating balms that swell your paunch
        The pious poet's wounded heart to staunch.
        You pour him hope, youth, life, and healing sleep--
        And pride, all Beggary's diadem and treasure,
        By which our triumphs with the Gods' we measure.

        Now like two angels off the track,
        Whom wild relentless fevers rack,
        On through the morning's crystal blue
        The swift mirages we'll pursue.
        Now softly poised upon the wings
        That a sagacious cyclone brings,
        In parallel delirium twinned,
        While side by side we surf the wind,
        We'll never cease from such extremes,

        Sometimes, knowing my love of Art, he uses
        Seductive forms of women: and has thus,
        With specious, hypocritical excuses,
        Accustomed me to philtres infamous.
        Leading me wayworn into wastes untrod
        Of boundless Boredom, out of sight of God,
        Using all baits to compass my abduction.
        Into my eyes, confused and full of woe,
        Soiled clothes and bleeding gashes he will throw
        And all the grim regalia of Destruction.

                              _The Martyr_
                     (Drawing by an Unknown Master)
        Amongst gilt fabrics, flasks of scent and wine,
        Rich furniture, white marble, precious moulds.
        Fine paintings, and rich, perfumed robes that shine
        Swirled into sumptuous folds,
        In a warm room, that like a hot-house stifles
        With dangerous and fatal breath, where lie
        Pale flowers in crystal tombs, exquisite trifles,
        Exhaling their last sigh--
        A headless corpse, cascading in a flood
        Hot, living blood, that soaks, with crimson stain
        A pillow slaked and sated with blood
        As any field with rain.
        Like those pale visions which the gloom aborts
        Which fix us in a still, hypnotic stare,
        The head, tricked out with gems of sorts,
        In its huge mass of hair,
        Like a ranunculous beside the bed,
        Rests on the table, empty of all thought.
        From eyes revulsed, like twilight, seems to spread
        A gaze that looks at naught.
        Upon the bed the carcase, unabashed,
        Shows, in complete abandon, without shift,
        The secret splendour that, in life, it flashed
        Superbly, Nature's gift.
        A rosy stocking, freaked with clocks of gold,
        Clings to one leg: a souvenir, it seems:
        The garter, from twin diamonds, with the cold
        Stare of a viper gleams.
        The singular effect of solitude
        And of a languorous portrait, with its eyes
        Provocative as is its attitude,
        Dark loves would advertise--
        And guilty joys, with feasts of strange delight,
        Full of infernal kisses, omens certain
        To please the gloating angels of the Night
        Who swim behind each curtain.
        And yet to see her nimble strength, the risky
        Swerve of the rounded shoulder, and its rake,
        The tented haunch, the figure lithe and frisky,
        Flexed like an angry snake,
        You'd know that she was young. Her soul affronted,
        Her senses stung with boredom--were they bayed
        By packs of wandering, lost desires, and hunted,
        And finally betrayed?
        The vengeful man, whose lust you could not sate,
        (In spite of much love) nor quench his fire--
        Did he on your dead flesh then consummate
        His monstrous, last desire?--
        Answer me, corpse impure! With fevered fist,
        Grim visage, did he raise you up on high,
        And, as your silver frosty teeth he kissed,
        Bid you his last goodbye?
        Far from inquiring magistrates that sneer,
        Far from this world of raillery and riot,
        Sleep peacefully, strange creature, on your bier,
        Of mystery and quiet.
        Your lover roams the world. Your deathless shape
        Watches his sleep and hears each indrawn breath.
        No more than you can he ever escape
        From constancy till death!

        They scan the far horizon of the ocean,
        Foot seeking foot, hand magnetising hand,
        With sweet or bitter tremors of emotion.
        Some with their hearts absorbed in confidences,
        Deep in the woods, where streamlets chatter free,
        Spell the loved names of childish, timid fancies,
        And carve the green wood of the fresh, young tree.
        Others, like sisters wander, slow and grave,
        Through craggy haunts of ghostly emanations,
        Where once Saint Anthony was wont to brave
        The purple-breasted pride of his temptations.
        Some by the light of resin-scented torches
        In the dumb hush of caverns seek their shrine,
        Invoking Bacchus, killer of remorses,
        To liven their delirium with wine.
        Others who deal with scapulars and hoods
        Hiding the whiplash under their long train,
        Mingle, on lonely nights in sombre woods,
        The foam of pleasure with the tears of pain.
        O demons, monsters, virgins, martyrs, you
        Who trample base reality in scorn,
        Whether as nuns or satyrs you pursue
        The infinite, with cries or tears forlorn,
        You, whom my soul has tracked to lairs infernal,
        Poor sisterhood, I pity and adore,
        For your despairing griefs, your thirst eternal,
        And love that floods your hearts for evermore!

        For the curst poet, foe to married rest,
        The friend of hell, and courtier on half-pay--
        Brothels and tombs reserve for such a guest
        A bed on which repentance never lay.
        Both tomb and bed, in blasphemy so fecund
        Each other's hospitality to second,
        Prepare grim treats, and hatch atrocious things.
        Debauch, when will you bury me? When, Death,
        Mingle your Cypress in the selfsame wreath
        With the infected Myrtles that she brings?

        I hear its long, low, rushing sound till, doubting,
        I feel myself all over for the wound.
        Across the town, as in the lists of battle,
        It flows, transforming paving stones to isles,
        Slaking the thirst of creatures, men, and cattle,
        And colouring all nature red for miles.
        Sometimes I've sought relief in precious wines
        To lull in me the fear that undermines,
        But found they sharpened every sense the more.
        I've also sought forgetfulness in lust,
        But love's a bed of needles, and they thrust
        To give more drink to each rapacious whore.

        Love's claws and poisons, brewed in sinks of sin,

        She mocks Debauchery, Death leaves her blithe,
        Two monsters always handy with the scythe.
        In their grim games, where so much beauty's wrecked,
        They treat her majesty with due respect.
        Half goddess, half sultana, without scathe,
        In pleasure she's a Moslem's steady faith.
        Between her open arms, filled by her breasts,
        For all mankind with burning eyes she quests,
        And she believes, this fruitless virgin-wife,
        Who's yet so necessary to this life,
        That beauty of the body is a gift
        Sublime enough all infamy to shift,
        And win forgiveness. She knows naught of Hell.
        When the Night comes, in which she is to dwell,
        Straight in the face she'll look her deadly Fate,
        Like one new-born--without remorse or hate.

        While I alone to Nature told my grief,
        I sharpened, as I went, like any dart,
        My thought upon the grindstone of my heart--
        When by a troop of vicious demons led,
        A great black cloud rushed down towards my head.
        As loafers at a lunatic they leered
        And in my face inquisitively peered.
        With nods and signs, like dwarfed and apish elves,
        They laughed, and winked, and spoke among themselves.
        `This parody of Hamlet, take his measure,
        And contemplate the travesty at leisure.
        Is it not sad to see the puzzled stare,
        The halting gait, and the dishevelled hair
        With which this clownish actor, on half-pay,
        Because he is an artist in his way,
        Attempts to interest, in the griefs he sings,
        Eagles, and crickets, flowers, and running springs,
        And even us, the authors of his woe,
        Howling his sorrows as a public show?`
        I could have dominated with my pride
        That horde of demons and the taunts they cried,
        Just by the mere aversion of my face--
        Had I not seen, amongst that evil race,
        (A crime that did not even daze the sun!)
        Queen of my heart, the peerless, only one,
        Laughing with them to see my dark distress,
        And giving them, at times, some lewd caress.

        My heart, a bird, seemed joyfully to fly
        And round the rigging cruised with nimble gyre.
        The vessel rolled beneath the cloudless sky
        Like a white angel, drunk with solar fire.
        What is that sad, black island like a pall?
        Why, Cytherea, famed in many a book,
        The Eldorado of old-stagers. Look:
        It's but a damned poor country after all!
        Isle of sweet secrets and heart-feasting fire!
        Of antique Venus the majestic ghost
        Rolls like a storm of fragrance from your coast
        Filling our souls with languor and desire!
        Isle of green myrtles, where each flower uncloses.
        Adored by nations till the end of time:
        Sighs of adoring hearts, like incense, climb.
        And pour their perfume over sheaves of roses.
        Or groves of turtles in an endless coo!
        But no! it was a waste where nothing grows,
        Torn only by the raucous cries of crows:
        Yet there a curious object rose in view.
        This was no temple hid in bosky trees,
        Where the young priestess, amorous of flowers,
        Whom secretly a loving flame devours,
        Walks with her robe half-open to the breeze.
        For as we moved inshore to coast the shallows
        And our white canvas scared the crows to fly,
        Like a tall cypress, blackened on the sky,
        We saw it was a gaunt three-forking gallows.
        Fierce birds, perched on their meal, began to slash
        And rip with rage a rotten corpse that swung.
        Each screwed and chiselled with its beak among
        The crisp and bleeding crannies of the hash.
        His eyes were holes: from open stomach direly
        His heavy tripes cascaded to his thighs.
        Gorged with such ghastly dainties to the eyes,
        His torturers had gelded him entirely.
        Beneath, some jealous prowling quadrupeds,
        With lifted muzzles, for the leavings scrambled.
        The largest seemed, as in the midst he gambolled,
        An executioner among his _aides_.
        Native of Cytherea's cloudless clime
        In silent suffering you paid the price,
        And expiated ancient cults of vice
        With generations of forbidden crime.
        Ridiculous hanged man! Your griefs I know.
        I felt, to see you swing above the heath,
        Like nausea slowly rising to my teeth,
        The bilious stream of ancient human woe.
        Poor devil, dear to memory! before me
        I seemed to feel each talon, fang, and beak
        Of all the stinking crows and panthers sleek
        That in my lifetime ever chewed and tore me.
        The sky was charming and the sea unclouded,
        But all was black and bloody to my mind.
        As in a dismal winding-sheet entwined,
        My heart was in this allegory shrouded.
        A gallows where my image hung apart
        Was all I found on Venus' isle of sighs.
        O God, give me the strength to scrutinise,
        Without disgust, my body and my heart!
                                 CXVII
                          _Love and the Skull_
                            (Old Tail-piece)
        With bold and insolent grimace,
        Love laughingly bestrides
        The bare skull of the Human Race,
        And, as enthroned he rides,
        Blows bubbles from his rosy cheek
        Which soar into the sky
        As if, beyond the blue, to seek
        The other worlds on high.
        They ride with wondrous verve at first,
        Reflect the sunny beams,
        Then spit their flimsy souls, to burst
        And fade like golden dreams.
        I hear the skull at each renewal
        Expostulate aghast--
        `This game, ridiculous and cruel--
        When will it end at last?
        For what your cruel mouthpiece drains
        And scatters, sud by sud,
        Monstrous Assassin! is my brains,
        My substance, and my blood.`
                                REVOLTE
     The following Author's Note was printed, in the first edition
     of LES FLEURS DU MAL (1857).
     Among the following poems, the most notorious one has already
     appeared in one of the principal literary reviews of Paris;
     it has been taken, at least by intelligent people, for what
     it is, a _pastiche_ on the arguments used by ignorance and
     anger. Keeping the painful task which he has set himself, the
     author of LES FLEURS DU MAL has, like a true comedian, assumed
     the attitudes of sophistry and of corruption. No doubt, this
     candid statement will not prevent `honest` critics from
     ranking him among the theologians of the mob, and accusing him
     of being sorry that our Saviour Jesus Christ, the eternal,
     voluntary victim, did not play the role of a conqueror, of a
     destroying and equalitarian Attila. Many will doubtless utter
     the Pharisee's usual thanksgiving: `I thank Thee, Lord, that I
     am not as this infamous poet`.

                      _The Denial of Saint Peter_
        What does God do with that huge storm of curses
        That rises daily to the seraphim?
        Like some gorged tyrant, while his guts he nurses,
        Our blasphemies are lullabies to him.
        Martyrs and tortured victims with their cries
        Compose delicious symphonies, no doubt,
        Because, despite the blood they cost, the skies
        Can always do with more when they give out.
        Jesus, remember, in the olive trees--
        In all simplicity you prayed afresh
        To One whom your own butchers seemed to please
        In hammering the nails into your flesh.
        To see your godhead spat on by the like
        Of scullions, and of troopers, and such scum,
        And feel the thorns into your temples strike
        Which held, of all Humanity, the sum:
        To feel your body's horrifying weight
        Lengthen your arms, to feel the blood and sweat
        Itching your noble forehead pale with fate,
        And as a target to the world be set,
        Then did you dream of brilliant days of song,
        When, the eternal promise to fulfill,
        You mounted on an ass and rode along,
        Trampling the flowers and palms beneath your feet,
        When whirling whips, and full of valiant force,
        The money-lenders quailed at your advance:
        When you, in short, were master? Did remorse
        Not pierce your body further than the lance?
        I am quite satisfied to leave so bored
        A world, where dream and action disunite.
        I'd use the sword, to perish by the sword.
        Peter denied his Master? . . . He did right!

                                   I.
        Race of Abel! eat, sleep, drink.
        God smiles on those that he prefers.
        Race of Cain! in swamps that stink,
        Crawl, and die the death of curs.
        Race of Abel! your crops sprout,
        And your flocks are safe and sound.
        Race of Cain! your guts howl out
        In hunger, like an ancient hound.
        Race of Abel! warm your guts
        At the patriarchal fire.
        Race of Cain! in caves and huts
        Shiver like jackals in the mire.
        Race of Abel! Pullulate:
        Your gold too procreates its kind.
        Race of Cain! Hearts hot with hate,
        Leave all such appetites behind.
        Race of Abel! grow and graze,
        Like woodlice that on timbers prey.
        Race of Cain! along rough ways
        Lead forth your family at bay.
                                  II.
        Ah! Race of Abel! your fat carrion
        Will well manure the soil it presses.
        Race of Cain! One task to carry on
        Remains for you, a task that presses.
        Race of Abel! Shame is nigh.
        The coulter's beaten by the sword.
        Race of Cain, climb up the sky,
        And to the earth hurl down the Lord.

                          _Litanies of Satan_
        Wisest of Angels, whom your fate betrays,
        And, fairest of them all, deprives of praise,
                    Satan have pity on my long despair!
        O Prince of exiles, who have suffered wrong,
        Yet, vanquished, rise from every fall more strong,
                    Satan have pity on my long despair!
        All-knowing lord of subterranean things,
        Who remedy our human sufferings,
                    Satan have pity on my long despair!
        To lepers and lost beggars full of lice,
        You teach, through love, the taste of Paradise.
                    Satan have pity on my long despair!
        You who on Death, your old and sturdy wife,
        Engendered Hope--sweet folly of this life--
                    Satan have pity on my long despair!
        You give to the doomed man that calm, unbaffled
        Gaze that rebukes the mob around the scaffold,
                    Satan have pity on my long despair!
        You know in what closed corners of the earth
        A jealous God has hidden gems of worth.
                    Satan have pity on my long despair!
        You know the deepest arsenals, where slumber
        The breeds of buried metals without number.
                    Satan have pity on my long despair!
        You whose huge hand has hidden the abyss
        From sleepwalkers that skirt the precipice,
                    Satan have pity on my long despair!
        You who give suppleness to drunkards' bones
        When trampled down by horses on the stones,
                    Satan have pity on my long despair!
        You who, to make his sufferings the lighter,
        Taught man to mix the sulphur with the nitre,
                    Satan have pity on my long despair!
        You fix your mask, accomplice full of guile,
        On rich men's foreheads, pitiless and vile.
                    Satan have pity on my long despair!
        You who fill the hearts and eyes of whores
        With love of trifles and the cult of sores,
                    Satan have pity on my long despair!
        The exile's staff, inventor's lamp, caresser
        Of hanged men, and of plotters the confessor,
                    Satan have pity on my long despair!
        Step-father of all those who, robbed of pardon,
        God drove in anger out of Eden's garden.
                    Satan have pity on my long despair!
                                 Prayer
        Praise to you, Satan! in the heights you lit,
        And also in the deeps where now you sit,
        Vanquished, in Hell, and dream in hushed defiance.
        O that my soul, beneath the Tree of Science
        Might rest near you, while shadowing your brows,
        It spreads a second Temple with its boughs.

        We shall have beds round which light scents are wafted,
        Divans which are as deep and wide as tombs;
        Strange flowers that under brighter skies were grafted
        Will scent our shelves with rare exotic blooms.
        When, burning to the last their mortal ardour,
        Our torch-like hearts their bannered flames unroll,
        Their double light will kindle all the harder
        Within the deep, twinned mirror of our soul.
        One evening made of mystic rose and blue,
        I will exchange a lightning-flash with you,
        Like a long sob that bids a last adieu.
        Later, the Angel, opening the door
        Faithful and happy, will at last renew
        Dulled mirrors, and the flames that leap no more.

                         _The Death of Paupers_
        It's Death comforts us, alas! and makes us live.
        It is the goal of life, it brings us hope,
        And, like a rich elixir, seems to give
        Courage to march along the darkening slope.
        Across the tempest, hail, and hoarfrost, look!
        Along the black horizon, a faint gleam!
        It is the inn that's written in the book
        Where one can sleep, and eat, and sit and dream.
        An Angel, in magnetic hands it holds
        Sleep and the gift of sweet ecstatic dreams,
        And makes a bed for poor and naked souls.
        It is God's glory and the mystic grange:
        The poor man's purse and fatherland it seems,
        And door that opens Heavens vast and strange.

                         _The Death of Artists_
        How often must I shake my bells, and kiss
        Your brow, sad Travesty? How many a dart,
        My quiver, shoot at Nature's mystic heart
        Before I hit the target that I miss?
        We'll still consume our souls in subtle schemes,
        Demolishing tough harness, long before
        We see the giant Creature of our dreams
        Whom all the world is weeping to adore.
        Some never knew their Idol, though they prayed:
        And these doomed sculptors, with an insult branded,
        Hammer your brows and bosom, heavy-handed,
        In the one hope, O Capitol of shade!
        That Death like some new sun should rise and give
        Warmth to their wasted flowers, and make them live.

                          _The End of the Day_
        Under the wan, dejected skies,
        Impudent, raucous, full of treason,
        This life runs dancing without reason.
        Voluptuous night begins to rise,
        Appeasing even those who fast,
        Ravenous hunger making tame,
        And hiding all things, even shame,
        Until the Poet says, `At last
        My spirit, like my weary spine,
        Can do with slumber, that is certain,
        Sad dreams invade this heart of mine.
        I'm off to lie down on my back,
        And roll myself into your curtain,
        Refreshing shadows, dense and black!`

        Have you known such a savoury grief as I?
        Do people say `Strange fellow!`, whom you meet?
        --My amorous soul, when I was due to die,
        Felt longing mixed with horror; pain seemed sweet.
        Anguish and ardent hope (no factious whim)
        Were mixed: and as the sands of life ran low
        My torture grew delicious yet more grim,
        And of this dear old world would not let go.
        I seemed a child, so keen to see the Show
        He feels a deadly hatred of the Curtain . . .
        And then I saw the hard, cold truth for certain.
        I felt that dreadful dawn around me grow
        With no surprise or vestige of a thrill.
        The curtain rose--and I stayed waiting still.

                           TO MAXIME DU CAMP
        For children crazed with postcards, prints, and stamps
        All space can scarce suffice their appetite.
        How vast the world seems by the light of lamps,
        But in the eyes of memory how slight!
        One morning we set sail, with brains on fire,
        And hearts swelled up with rancorous emotion,
        Balancing, to the rhythm of its lyre,
        Our infinite upon the finite ocean.
        Some wish to leave their venal native skies,
        Some flee their birthplace, others change their ways,
        Astrologers who've drowned in Beauty's eyes,
        Tyrannic Circe with the scent that slays.
        Not to be changed to beasts, they have their fling
        With space, and splendour, and the burning sky.
        The suns that bronze them and the frosts that sting
        Efface the mark of kisses by and by.
        But the true travellers are those who go
        Only to get away: hearts like balloons
        Unballasted, with their own fate aglow,
        Who know not why they fly with the monsoons:
        Those whose desires are in the shape of clouds.
        And dream, as raw recruits of shot and shell,
        Of mighty raptures in strange, transient crowds
        Of which no human soul the name can tell.
                                   II
        Horror! We imitate the top and bowl
        In swerve and bias. Through our sleep it runs.
        It's Curiosity that makes us roll
        As the fierce Angel whips the whirling suns.
        Singular game! where the goal changes places;
        The winning-post is nowhere, yet all round;
        Where Man tires not of the mad hope he races
        Thinking, some day, that respite will be found.
        Our soul's like a three-master, where one hears
        A voice that from the bridge would warn all hands.
        Another from the foretop madly cheers
        `Love, joy, and glory` . . . Hell! we're on the sands!
        The watchmen think each isle that heaves in view
        An Eldorado, shouting their belief.
        Imagination riots in the crew
        Who in the morning only find a reef.
        The fool that dotes on far, chimeric lands--
        Put him in irons, or feed him to the shark!
        The drunken sailor's visionary lands
        Can only leave the bitter truth more stark.
        So some old vagabond, in mud who grovels,
        Dreams, nose in air, of Edens sweet to roam.
        Wherever smoky wicks illumine hovels
        He sees another Capua or Rome.
                                  III
        Amazing travellers, what noble stories
        We read in the deep oceans of your gaze!
        Show us your memory's casket, and the glories
        Streaming from gems made out of stars and rays!
        We, too, would roam without a sail or steam,
        And to combat the boredom of our jail,
        Would stretch, like canvas on our souls, a dream,
        Framed in horizons, of the seas you sail.
        What have you seen?
                                   IV
            `We have seen stars and waves.
        We have seen sands and shores and oceans too,
        In spite of shocks and unexpected graves,
        We have been bored, at times, the same as you.
        The solar glories on the violet ocean
        And those of spires that in the sunset rise,
        Lit, in our hearts, a yearning, fierce emotion
        To plunge into those ever-luring skies.
        The richest cities and the scenes most proud
        In nature, have no magic to enamour
        Like those which hazard traces in the cloud
        While wistful longing magnifies their glamour.
        Enjoyment adds more fuel for desire,
        Old tree, to which all pleasure is manure;
        As the bark hardens, so the boughs shoot higher,
        And nearer to the sun would grow mature.
        Tree, will you always flourish, more vivacious
        Than cypress?--None the less, these views are yours:
        We took some photographs for your voracious
        Album, who only care for distant shores.
        We have seen idols elephantine-snouted,
        And thrones with living gems bestarred and pearled,
        And palaces whose riches would have routed
        The dreams of all the bankers in the world.
        We have seen wonder-striking robes and dresses,
        Women whose nails and teeth the betel stains
        And jugglers whom the rearing snake caresses.`
                                   V
        What then? What then?
                                   VI
            `O childish little brains,
        Not to forget the greatest wonder there--
        We've seen in every country, without searching,
        From top to bottom of the fatal stair
        Immortal sin ubiquitously lurching:
        Woman, a vile slave, proud in her stupidity,
        Self-worshipping, without the least disgust:
        Man, greedy, lustful, ruthless in cupidity,
        Slave to a slave, and sewer to her lust:
        The torturer's delight, the martyr's sobs,
        The feasts where blood perfumes the giddy rout:
        Power sapping its own tyrants: servile mobs
        In amorous obeisance to the knout:
        Some similar religions to our own,
        All climbing skywards: Sanctity who treasures,
        As in his downy couch some dainty drone,
        In horsehair, nails, and whips, his dearest pleasures.
        Prating Humanity, with genius raving,
        As mad today as ever from the first,
        Cries in fierce agony, its Maker braving,
        'O God, my Lord and likeness, be thou cursed!'
        But those less dull, the lovers of Dementia,
        Fleeing the herd which fate has safe impounded,
        In opium seek for limitless adventure.
        --That's all the record of the globe we rounded.`
                                  VII
        It's bitter knowledge that one learns from travel.
        The world so small and drab, from day to day,
        The horror of our image will unravel,
        A pool of dread in deserts of dismay.
        Must we depart, or stay? Stay if you can.
        Go if you must. One runs: another hides
        To baffle Time, that fatal foe to man.
        And there are runners, whom no rest betides,
        Like the Apostles or the Wandering Jew,
        Whom neither ship nor waggon can enable
        To cheat the retiary. But not a few
        Have killed him without stirring from their cradle.
        But when he sets his foot upon our nape
        We still can hope and cry `Leave all behind!`
        As in old times to China we'll escape
        With eyes turned seawards, hair that fans the wind,--
        We'll sail once more upon the sea of Shades
        With heart like that of a young sailor beating.
        I hear the rich, sad voices of the Trades
        Who cry `This Way! all you who would be eating
        The scented Lotus. Here it is they range
        The piles of magic fruit. O hungry friend,
        Come here and swoon away into the strange
        Trance of an afternoon that has no end.`
        In the familiar tones we sense the spectre.
        Our Pylades stretch arms across the seas,
        `To salve your heart, now swim to your Electra`
        She cries, of whom we used to kiss the knees.
                                  VIII
        O Death, old Captain, it is time. Weigh anchor!
        To sail beyond the doldrums of our days.
        Though black as pitch the sea and sky, we hanker
        For space; you know our hearts are full of rays.
        Pour us your poison to revive our soul!
        It cheers the burning quest that we pursue,
        Careless if Hell or Heaven be our goal,
        Beyond the known world to seek out the New!

                           _Romantic Sunset_
        How lovely is the sun, when, freshly soaring,
        Like an explosion, first he bids `Good-Day`--
        Happy the man, on gorgeous sunsets poring,
        Who can salute with love its parting ray.
        I've seen all things, flower, furrow, pond, and rill,
        Swoon in his gaze like a poor heart that dies.
        Run to the skyline. It is late. We still
        May catch one parting ray before it flies.
        But it's in vain I chase my God receding.
        Night irresistible, damp, black, unheeding
        Establishes her empire, full of fear.
        Amongst the shades a grave-like odour trails.
        My naked feet walk into chilly snails
        And bullfrogs unforeseen along the mere.

                                _Lesbos_
        Mother of Grecian joys and Latin games,
        Lesbos, where kisses, languishing or gay,
        As melons cool, or warm as solar flames,
        Adorn alike the glorious night and day:
        Mother of Grecian joys and Latin games,
        Lesbos of kisses reckless as cascades
        That hurl themselves to bottomless abysses,
        Stormy and secret, myriad-swarming kisses,
        That cluck and sob and gurgle in the shades.
        Lesbos of kisses reckless as cascades!
        Lesbos where Phrynes each to each are plighted,
        Where never yet unanswered went a sigh,
        Where Paphos with a rival is requited,
        And Venus with a Sappho has to vie!
        Lesbos where Phrynes each to each are plighted,
        Lesbos, the land of warm and languid night,
        Where gazing in their mirrors as they dress
        The cave-eyed girls, in barren, vain delight,
        The fruits of their nubility caress.
        Lesbos, the land of warm and languid night,
        Let Plato frown austerely all the while.
        Your pardon's from excess of kisses won.
        Queen of sweet empire, rare and noble isle--
        And from refinements which are never done.
        Let Plato frown austerely all the while.
        From martyrdom your pardon you beguile,
        Inflicted without stint on hearts that soar
        Far, far away, drawn by some radiant smile
        Seen vaguely on a strange celestial shore.
        From martyrdom your pardon you beguile.
        Lesbos, what God to judge you would make bold,
        Or damn your brows so pale and sadly grave,
        Not having weighed upon the scales of gold
        The floods of tears you've poured into the wave.
        Lesbos which God to judge you would make bold?
        For us, what mean the statutes of the just?
        Pride of the isles, whose hearts sublimely swell,
        Your faith as any other is august
        And Love can laugh alike at Heaven and Hell.
        For us, what mean the statues of the just?
        For Lesbos chose me of all men on earth
        To sing the secrets of her virgin flowers,
        Taught as a child the sacred rites of mirth
        And mysteries of sorrow which are ours.
        So Lesbos chose me of all men on earth.
        Since then I watch on the Leucadian height.
        Like a lone sentry with a piercing view
        Who sees the vessels ere they heave in sight
        With forms that faintly tremble in the blue.
        Since then I watch on the Leucadian height
        To find out if the sea's heart still is hardened
        And from the sobs that drench the rock with spray
        If it will bring back Sappho, who has pardoned,
        The corpse of the adored, who went away
        To find out that the sea its heart has hardened;
        Of the male Sappho, lover, queen of singers,
        More beautiful than Venus by her woes.
        The blue eye cannot match the black, where lingers
        The shady circle that her grief bestows
        On the male Sappho, lover, queen of singers--
        Fairer than Venus towering on the world
        And pouring down serenity like water
        In the blond radiance of her tresses curled
        To daze the very Ocean with her daughter,
        Fairer than Venus towering on the world--
        Of Sappho, whom her blasphemy requited
        The day she quit the rite and scorned the cult,
        And gave her lovely body to be slighted
        By a rough brute, whose scorn was the result
        For Sappho, whom the blasphemy requited.
        And since that time has Lesbos lived lamenting
        In spite of all the honours of mankind,
        And lives upon the storm-howl unrelenting
        Of its bleak shores, the sport of wave and wind:
        For since that time has Lesbos lived lamenting.
                                  III
                             _Damned Women_
                         Delphine and Hippolyta
        Over deep cushions, drenched with drowsy scents
        Where fading lamplight shed its dying glow,
        Hippolyta recalls and half-repents
        The kisses that first thawed her youthful snow.
        She sought, with tempest-troubled gaze, the skies
        Of her first innocence, now far away,
        As travellers who backward turn their eyes
        To blue horizons passed at break of day.
        Within her haggard eyes the tears were bright.
        Her broken look, her dazed, voluptuous air,
        Her vanquished arms like weapons shed in flight,
        Enhanced her fragile beauty with despair.
        Stretched at her feet Delphine contented lay
        And watched with burning eyeballs from beneath
        Like a fierce tigress who, to guard her prey,
        Has set a mark upon it with her teeth.
        Strong beauty there to fragile beauty kneeling,
        Superb, she seemed to sniff the heady wine
        Of triumph: and stretched out to her, appealing
        For the reward of raptures half-divine.
        She sought within her victim's pallid eye
        Dumb hymns that pleasure sings without a choir,
        And gratitude that, like a long-drawn sigh,
        Swells from the eyelid, swooning with fire.
        `Hippolyta, dear heart, have you no trust?
        Do you not know the folly that exposes
        To the fierce pillage of the brawling gust
        The sacred holocaust of early roses?
        My kisses are as light as fairy midges
        That on calm evenings skim the crystal lake.
        Those of your man would plough such ruts and ridges
        As lumbering carts or tearing coulters make.
        They'll tramp across you, like a ruthless team
        Of buffaloes or horses, yoked in lust.
        Dear sister, turn your face to me, my dream,
        My soul, my all, my twin, to whom I trust!
        Turn me your eyes of deepest, starry blue.
        For one of those deep glances that you send,
        I'd lift the veil of darkest joys for you
        And rock you in a dream that has no end.`
        But then Hippolyta raised up her head,
        `No blame nor base ingratitude I feel,
        But, as it were, a kind of nauseous dread
        After some terrible, nocturnal meal.
        I feel a swooping terror that explodes
        In legions of black ghosts towards me speeding
        Who crowd me on to swiftly moving roads,
        That, sliced by sheer horizons, end up bleeding.
        Have we done something monstrous that I tremble?
        Explain, then, if you can; for when you say,
        'Angel', I cower. Yet I cannot dissemble
        That, when you speak, my lips are drawn your way.
        Oh, do not fix me with a stare so steady
        You whom I love till death in still submission,
        Yes, even though you, like an ambush ready,
        Are the beginning of my own perdition.`
        Then Delphine stamped and shook her tragic mane,
        And, like a priestess, foaming and fierce, and fell,
        Spoke in a lordly and prophetic strain
        --`Who dares, in front of Love, to mention Hell?
        Curbed forever be that useless dreamer
        Who first imagined, in his brutish mind,
        Of sheer futility the fatuous schemer,
        Honour with Love could ever be combined.
        He who in mystic union would enmesh
        Shadow with warmth, and daytime with the night,
        Will never warm his paralytic flesh
        At the red sun of amorous delight.
        Go, if you wish, and seek some boorish lover:
        Offer your virgin heart to his crude hold,
        Full of remorse and horror you'll recover,
        And bring me your scarred breast to be consoled . . .
        Down here, a soul can only serve one master.`
        But the girl, venting her tremendous woe,
        Cried out `I feel a huge pit of disaster
        Yawning within: it is my heart, I know!
        Like a volcano burning, deep as death,
        There's naught that groaning monster can assuage
        Nor quench of thirst the Fury's burning breath
        Who brands it with a torch to make it rage.
        Let our closed curtains isolate the rest,
        Until exhaustion bring us sleep, while I
        Annihilate myself upon your breast
        And find in you a tomb on which to die.`
        Go down, go down, poor victims, it is time;
        The road to endless hell awaits your lusts.
        Plunge to the bottom of the gulf, where crime
        Is flagellated by infernal gusts.
        Swirling pell-mell, and with a tempest's roar,
        Mad shades, pursue your craving without measure:
        Your rages will be sated nevermore,
        Your torture is begotten of your pleasure.
        No sunbeam through your dungeon will come leaking:
        Only miasmic fevers, through each chink,
        Will filter, like sick lanterns, redly streaking,
        And penetrate your bodies with their stink.
        The harsh sterility of all you relish
        Will swell your thirst, and turn you both to hags.
        The wind of your desire, with fury hellish
        Will flog your flapping carrion like wet flags.
        Far from live folk, like werewolves howling high,
        Gallop the boundless deserts you unroll.
        Fulfill your doom, disordered minds, and fly
        The infinite you carry in your soul.
                                   IV
                                _Lethe_
        Rest on my heart, deaf, cruel soul, adored
        Tigress, and monster with the lazy air.
        I long, in the black jungles of your hair,
        To force each finger thrilling like a sword;
        Within wide skirts, filled with your scent, to hide
        My bruised and battered forehead hour by hour,
        And breathe, like dampness from a withered flower,
        The pleasant mildew of a love that died.
        Rather than live, I wish to sleep, alas!
        Lulled in a slumber soft and dark as death,
        In ruthless kisses lavishing my breath
        Upon your body smooth as burnished brass.
        To swallow up my sorrows in eclipse,
        Nothing can match your couch's deep abysses;
        The stream of Lethe issues from your kisses
        And powerful oblivion from your lips.
        Like a predestined victim I submit:
        My doom, to me, henceforth, is my delight,
        A willing martyr in my own despite
        Whose fervour fans the faggots it has lit.
        To drown my rancour and to heal its smart,
        Nepenthe and sweet hemlock, peace and rest,
        I'll drink from the twin summits of a breast
        That never lodged the semblance of a heart.

                        _To One Who Is Too Gay_
        Your head, your gestures, and your air
        Are lovely as a landscape; smiles
        Rimple upon your face at whiles
        Like winds in the clear sky up there.
        The grumpy passers that you graze
        Are dazzled by the radiant health,
        And the illimitable wealth
        Your arms and shoulders seem to blaze.
        The glaring colours that, in showers,
        Clash in your clothes with such commotion,
        In poets' minds suggest the notion
        Of a mad ballet-dance of flowers.
        These garish dresses illustrate
        Your spirit, striped with every fad.
        O madwoman, whom, quite as mad,
        I love as madly as I hate.
        Sometimes in gardens, seeking rest,
        Where I have dragged my soul atonic,
        I've felt the sun with gaze ironic
        Tearing the heart within my breast.
        The spring and verdure, dressed to stagger,
        Humiliate me with such power
        That I have punished, in a flower,
        The insolence of Nature's swagger.
        And so, one night, I'd like to sneak,
        When night has tolled the hour of pleasure,
        A craven thief, towards the treasure
        Which is your person, plump and sleek.
        To punish your bombastic flesh,
        To bruise your breast immune to pain,
        To furrow down your flank a lane
        Of gaping crimson, deep and fresh.
        And, most vertiginous delight!
        Into those lips, so freshly striking
        And daily lovelier to my liking--
        Infuse the venom of my sprite.
                                   VI
                              _The Jewels_
        My well-beloved was stripped. Knowing my whim,
        She wore her tinkling gems, but naught besides:
        And showed such pride as, while her luck betides,
        A sultan's favoured slave may show to him.
        When it lets off its lively, crackling sound,
        This blazing blend of metal crossed with stone,
        Gives me an ecstasy I've only known
        Where league of sound and lustre can be found.
        She let herself be loved: then, drowsy-eyed,
        Smiled down from her high couch in languid ease.
        My love was deep and gentle as the seas
        And rose to her as to a cliff the tide.
        My own approval of each dreamy pose,
        Like a tamed tiger, cunningly she sighted:
        And candour, with lubricity united,
        Gave piquancy to every one she chose.
        Her limbs and hips, burnished with changing lustres,
        Before my eyes clairvoyant and serene,
        Swanned themselves, undulating in their sheen;
        Her breasts and belly, of my vine the clusters,
        Like evil angels rose, my fancy twitting,
        To kill the peace which over me she'd thrown,
        And to disturb her from the crystal throne
        Where, calm and solitary, she was sitting.
        So swerved her pelvis that, in one design,
        Antiope's white rump it seemed to graft
        To a boy's torso, merging fore and aft.
        The talc on her brown tan seemed half-divine.
        The lamp resigned its dying flame. Within,
        The hearth alone lit up the darkened air,
        And every time it sighed a crimson flare
        It drowned in blood that amber-coloured skin.
                                  VII
                   _The Metamorphoses of the Vampire_
        The crimson-fruited mouth that I desired--
        While, like a snake on coals, she twinged and twired,
        Kneading her breasts against her creaking busk--
        Let fall those words impregnated with musk,
        --`My lips are humid: by my learned science,
        All conscience, in my bed, becomes compliance.
        My breasts, triumphant, staunch all tears; for me
        Old men, like little children, laugh with glee.
        For those who see me naked, I replace
        Sun, moon, the sky, and all the stars in space.
        I am so skilled, dear sage, in arts of pleasure,
        That, when with man my deadly arms I measure,
        Or to his teeth and kisses yield my bust,
        Timid yet lustful, fragile, yet robust,
        On sheets that swoon with passion--you might see
        Impotent angels damn themselves for me.`
        When of my marrow she had sucked each bone
        And, languishing, I turned with loving moan
        To kiss her in return, with overplus,--
        She seemed a swollen wineskin, full of pus.
        I shut my eyes with horror at the sight,
        But when I opened them, in the clear light,
        I saw, instead of the great swollen doll
        That, bloated with my lifeblood, used to loll,
        The debris of a skeleton, assembling
        With shrill squawks of a weathercock, lie trembling,
        Or sounds, with which the howling winds commingle,
        Of an old Inn-sign on a rusty tringle.

                             _The Fountain_
        My darling of a sweetheart, close,
        For a long time, your great, tired eyes,
        Keeping them in that languid pose
        Where pleasure took them by surprise.
        Out in the court the fountain chatters
        And does not cease by day or night.
        The swoon of ecstasy it flatters
        In which love plunges me tonight.
              Its sheaf uprears
              A myriad flowers,
              While Phoebe sheers
              Through pearl-flushed hours,
              To rain down tears
              In glittering showers.
        So does your flashing soul ignite
        In lightnings of voluptuous bliss
        And rushes reckless up the height
        As though the enchanted sky to kiss;
        Then it relaxes, grows more fine,
        And in sad languor falls apart
        Down an invisible incline
        Into the deep well of my heart.
              Its sheaf uprears
              A myriad flowers,
              While Phoebe sheers
              Through pearl-flushed hours,
              To rain down tears
              In glittering showers.
        O you whom night so beautifies
        How sweet unto your breast to bend
        And hear the water as it sighs
        Into the ponds without an end
        Moon, singing water, blessed night
        And trees that tremble up above--
        Your melancholy charms my sprite
        And is the mirror of my love.
              Its sheaf uprears
              A myriad flowers,
              While Phoebe sheers

              To rain down tears
              In glittering showers.

                            _Bertha's Eyes_
        The most illustrious gaze you may despise,
        Eyes of my child, where filters and takes flight
        I know not what of goodness, soft as night.
        Pour out on me your lovely shade, dear eyes!
        Great eyes of my dear child! arcanes adored!
        You seem like magic caves where shadow darkles
        And, through the mass of crowded gloom, there sparkles
        And scintillates some richly treasured hoard.
        My girl has eyes as deep, vast, and serene
        As you, O night, immense, and lit like you;
        Their fires are thoughts of Love, with faith shot through,
        Voluptuous, and chaste, though sparkling keen.

        The Angel, and the deathless grail
        Who fill my heart with radiance clear--

        Into my life she flows translated
        As saline breezes fill the sky,
        And pours into my soul unsated
        The taste of what can never die.
        Sachet, forever fresh, perfuming
        Some quiet nook of hid delight;
        A lone forgotten censer fuming
        In secrecy across the night.
        How, flawless love, with truth impart
        Your purity and keep it whole,
        O unseen grain of musk who art
        The core of my eternal soul?
        To the most lovely, the most dear,

                             _The Monster_
                                   I.
        Beloved, certainly you're not
        What Veuillot calls a `tenderling`.
        Bubbling in you, as in a pot,
        Dice, lust and revel have their fling.
        My dear old child, you're surely not
        Too fresh these days. However, dear,
        Your tireless game of fast-and-loose
        Has given you that smooth veneer,
        That things acquire from constant use.
        It has its charms, however dear.
        I do not find it growing stale--
        That sap your forty summers bring
        Since autumn fruits with me prevail
        Over the banal flowers of spring.
        No! you are never dull nor stale.
        Your carcase for your age atones,
        And gives particular delight
        In hollows of your collar bones,
        And other places out of sight.
        Your carcase certainly atones.
        A fig for those poor doting fools
        Who're melon-struck and pumpkin mad,
        Since I prefer your clavicules
        To those King Solomon once had.
        A fig for such poor doting fools!
        A blue-black helmet is your hair.
        It shades your warrior's brow whereon
        Both thoughts and blushes are so rare--
        And then sweeps backward, and is gone!
        A blue black helmet is your hair.
        Your eyes resemble mud and mire,
        Whereon a flaring lantern streaks,
        Reflects the fard upon your cheeks,
        And glows with pale infernal fire.
        Your eyes are coloured like the mire.
        By its voluptuous disdain
        Your bitter lip provokes our lust.
        It's Eden's apple once again,
        Half is attraction, half disgust,
        In its voluptuous disdain.
        Your leg, so muscular and dry,
        Could climb volcanoes, never stop,
        And, spite of snow, and wind, and rain,
        Perform a cancan at the top.
        Your leg is muscular and dry.
        Your burning skin is void of sweetness:
        Like an old soldier's it appears.
        To sweat it never had the weakness
        More than your eyes could furnish tears.
        And yet it has a kind of sweetness!
                                  II.
        Fool! You are driving to the Devil.
        Willingly I would go with you
        If the momentum of your revel
        Did not exasperate me too.
        Fool! go, alone, then, to the Devil.
        My hip, my lung, my hams, my thigh
        Won't let me longer pay respects
        (Although it often makes me sigh)
        To that great Lord, as he expects.
        It's very sad for ham and thigh.
        Oh most sincerely do I suffer
        Not to accompany your freaks;
        When he is flatulating sulphur
        To see you kiss him where he leaks.
        O most sincerely do I suffer!
        I feel so devilish annoyed
        No more to serve you as a socket,
        You hellish torch! Infernal rocket!
        And to declare my duty void;
        I do feel devilish annoyed,
        Since for a long, long time I love you
        Being so logical. My dream
        Was of all Ill to skim the cream,
        Place no monstrosity above you
        And own you in that line supreme.
        Truly, old monster! yes, I love you.

                 _Verses for HonorÃ© Daumier's Portrait_
        The man whose image this presents,
        In art more subtle than the rest,
        Teaches us sagely, as is best,
        To chuckle at our own expense.
        In mockery he stands apart.
        His energy defies an equal
        In painting Evil and its sequel--
        Which proves the beauty of his heart--
        Melmoth or Mephostopheles,
        His mirth has naught akin to theirs.
        The flambeau of Alecto flares
        To singe them, while it makes us freeze.
        Their merriment they come to rue
        So steeped in treachery and guile,
        While his frank radiating smile
        Declares him to be good and true.

        The radiance of a black and rosy jewel.

              _On Delacroix's picture of Tasso in Prison_
        The poet, sick, and with his chest half bare
        Tramples a manuscript in his dark stall,
        Gazing with terror at the yawning stair
        Down which his spirit finally must fall.
        Intoxicating laughs which fill his prison
        Invite him to the Strange and the Absurd.
        With ugly shapes around him have arisen
        Both Doubt and Terror, multiform and blurred.
        This genius cooped in an unhealthy hovel,
        These cries, grimaces, ghosts that squirm and grovel
        Whirling around him, mocking as they call,
        This dreamer whom these horrors rouse with screams,
        They are your emblem, Soul of misty dreams
        Round whom the Real erects its stifling wall.

                              _The Voice_
        My cot was next the library, a Babel
        Where fiction jostled science, myth and fable.
        Greek dust with Roman ash there met the sight.
        And I was but a folio in height
        When two Voices addressed me. `Earth's a cake,`
        Said one, `and full of sweetness. I can make
        Your appetite to its proportions equal
        Forever and forever without sequel.`
        Another said `Come, rove in dreams, with me,
        Past knowledge, thought or possibility`.
        That voice sang like the wind along the shore
        And, though caressing, frightened me the more.
        I answered `O sweet Voice!` and from that date
        Could never name my sorrow or my fate.
        Behind the giant scenery of this life
        I see strange worlds: with my own self at strife,
        Ecstatic victim of my second sight,
        I trail huge snakes, that at my ankles bite.
        And like an ancient prophet, from that time,
        I've loved the desert, found the sea sublime;
        I've wept at festivals and laughed at wakes:
        And found in sourest wines a sweet that slakes;
        Falsehoods for facts I love to swallow whole,
        And often fall, star-gazing, in a hole.
        But the Voice cheers--`Keep dreaming. It's a rule
        No sage can dream such beauty as a fool`.

                              _The Ransom_
        Man, for his ransom, has two fields,
        Two fields of tufa, deep and rich,
        Which he must duly delve and ditch.
        His reason is the hoe he wields.
        In order to extort one rose,
        Or to produce a few poor ears,
        He has to squander showers of tears
        In watering the seeds he sows.
        One field is Art, the other Love;
        And both must for his favour bloom
        When the strict Judge appears above
        Upon the dreadful day of doom.
        Man's granges must be filled to burst
        With crops and flowers, whose form and shade
        Must win the angels' suffrage first
        Before his ransom can be paid.

                        _To a Girl from Malabar_
        Your feet are finer than your hands, and bigger
        Your haunch than plumpest white ones are. Your figure
        Is to a pensive artist dear and fresh.
        Your velvet eyes are darker than your flesh.
        In hot blue lands, where your God gave you being,
        Your task, lighting your master's pipe, and seeing
        The jars well filled with lymph, the flasks with scent,
        Or switching the mosquitoes--there you went,
        When dawn sang through the rustling planes, to buy
        Plantains or pineapples from the nearby
        Bazaar. All day, at will, barefoot you passed
        Humming old unknown tunes: and when at last
        The sun went down, bright red, across the flat,
        You flung your body on the wicker mat;
        And full of humming birds, your floating dream
        Was gay and flowery as you always seem.
        How, happy child, did you come here to France,
        This overpeopled land, by what mischance,
        When to your tamarinds you bade adieu
        Confiding in the sailors of the crew?
        But now half-clothed in muslin frail and thin,
        While frost and sleet assail your shivering skin,
        With brutal corsets prisoning you fast,
        How you must long for the old, carefree past!
        Now you must glean your dinners from the mud
        And sell the perfumes of your flesh and blood,
        In our foul mists, with pensive eye still straying
        To catch a glimpse of phantom palm trees swaying.

                           _Midnight Enquiry_
        The clocks strike midnight one by one
        Ironically to remind us,
        And ask what profit we have won
        Out of the day we've left behind us.
        The Thirteenth, Friday, as it chances!
        A fatal date; when all is said,
        In spite of all we know, we've led
        The most heretical of dances.
        Today we've spent blaspheming Jesus,
        The incontestable, sole Lord;
        Like a base sponger at the board
        Of some intolerable Croesus,
        We have, to please the beast within us,
        The Devil's worthy advocate,
        Defamed all that whose love should win us,
        And flattered all that we should hate.
        The weak man, like a bullying coward,
        We harmed, and wrongly did despise;
        We worshipped Folly, where he towered,
        Huge bull-horned monster, to the skies.
        We have lain kissing stupid Matter
        With great devotion to its presence,
        And of Corruption stooped to flatter
        The wan, mephitic phosphorescence.
        To drown our vertigo entire
        And our delirium to nourish--
        Proud priest of the immortal Lyre
        Whose glory it has been to flourish
        The rapture of funereal things--
        We've eaten without appetite,
        Unthirsting drunk of muddy springs.
        Come, quick, my soul, blow out the light,
        To hide in shades of blackest night!

                    _Epigraph for a Condemned Book_
        Dear reader, peaceful and bucolic,
        Ingenuous, sober, hierophantic,
        Lay by this book so corybantic,
        So Saturnine, and melancholic.
        If elsewhere than in Satan's school
        You learned your syntax and your grammar,
        Lay by! You'll think I rave and stammer
        And am a stark, hysteric fool.
        But if, not yielding to their charm,
        Your eye can plumb the gulfs of harm--
        Then learn to love me, read my verses.
        Inquiring sufferer, who seek
        Your paradise, to you I speak:
        Pity me! . . . else, receive my curses!

                                   I
        That you are good what does it matter?
        Be sad: be beautiful! The rain
        Rejuvenates the flowering plain.
        As streams do landscapes, teardrops flatter
        Your face. Your looks, by weeping, gain.
        When joy from your dejected forehead
        Has fled, your heart is in the power
        Of torment, and, to make you cower,
        The huge cloud of your past, with horrid
        Black shadow, overlooms the hour,
        I love you most: and when your eye
        Pours water hot as blood in battle,
        And when, despite the fact that I
        Am nursing you, you give a cry
        Like death, an agonising rattle.
        Delicious hymn, profound delight,
        Pleasure divine! I breathe with zest
        The sobs arising from your breast.
        I think your heart must blaze the light
        Of pearls that from your eyes are pressed.
                                   II
        I know your heart once more disgorges
        Its old uprooted love-affairs:
        And flaming with the heat of forges
        You feel the pride of vanished orgies,
        Which makes the damned put on such airs.
        But now ere yet your evil dreams
        Reflect the red flames of the Pit,
        While in an endless nightmare scheming
        Of poison-draughts and daggers gleaming,
        Cold steel and powder tempt your wit:
        While yet in fear the door you answer
        And see all things with vague mistrust:
        Free from his grasp, O dear entrancer,
        And not yet partnered for a dancer
        With irresistible Disgust,
        You'll never claim, both queen and slave,
        Who only love me with affright
        In the sick silence of the night,
        And while your feelings inly rave--
        To match with me in power or might.

        Each Man who's fit to be so called
        A Serpent in his heart has got,
        As though upon a throne installed,
        Who when he says `I will`, says `Not`.
        If your gaze the gaze transfixes
        O satyresses or of nixies,
        The Fang says, `Is your duty done?`
        Breed brats, plant trees, perform your task,
        Write verse, chip stone--the Fang will ask,
        `Will you be there at set of sun?`
        Men scheme each night and hope each morning,
        Yet no man grows one moment riper
        But suffers, at each turn, the warning
        Of the insufferable viper.

                              _The Rebel_
        An angel from the sky swoops like an eagle,
        Seizes the culprit's hair in his strong fist,
        And shakes him, saying `You must know what's legal!
        For I am your Good Angel. I insist.
        Know you must cherish, without wry grimaces,
        The poor, deformed, blockheaded, sick, and vile:
        And thus unroll for Christ's triumphal paces
        The carpet of your charity in style.
        For such is Love! Before your heart grows dim,
        Light up your heart from God and burn for him.
        That is the true delight that lasts for ever`.
        The Angel, by his love filled with more ardour,
        With giant fists belabours him the harder.
        The damned soul always answers, `I will never`.

                          _Far Away From Here_
        This is the room, the sacred nest
        Of that girl so richly dressed,
        Tranquil and ready for her guest.
        With one hand she fans her nipples
        Elbow on the couch at rest
        Listening to the ponds and ripples.
        This room is Dorothy's. The play
        Of wind and water, far away,
        With fainting song and rhythmic sobs,
        Through her reverie hums and throbs.
        From head to toe with greatest care
        Her skin is polished, to adorn her
        With benjamin and oils as rare . . .
        Some flowers are swooning in a corner.

                              _Meditation_
        Be good, my Sorrow: hush now: settle down.
        You sighed for dusk, and now it comes: look there!
        A denser atmosphere obscures the town,
        To some restoring peace, to others care.
        While the lewd multitude, like hungry beasts,
        By pleasure scourged (no thug so fierce as he!)
        Go forth to seek remorse among their feasts--
        Come, take my hand; escape from them with me.
        From balconies of sky, around us yet,
        Lean the dead years in fashions that have ceased.
        Out of the depth of waters smiles Regret.
        The sun sinks moribund beneath an arch,
        And like a long shroud rustling from the East,
        Hark, Love, the gentle Night is on the march.

                               _The Gulf_
        Wherever Pascal went, his gulf was spread,
        All is abyss--dream, act, desire, or word!
        And often by the wind of terror stirred
        I've felt the hair shoot upright on my head.
        High up, low down, all round, the depth descending,
        The verge, the silence, the dread captor, Space.
        Behind my nights I see God's finger trace
        A Nightmare multiform yet never-ending.
        I dread my sleep like some enormous hole
        Full of vague horror, leading to no goal.
        All windows bare the infinite to me.
        My soul, in its vertiginous endeavour,
        Envies the senseless void--Ah, never never
        From entities or numbers to be free!
                                   IX
                        _Complaint of an Icarus_
        Those who love whores are well-endowed,
        Spry, and well-fed, and cheerful-spoken.
        But, as for me, my arms are broken
        From trying to embrace a cloud.
        To what two peerless stars have done
        That kindle in the farthest skies,
        I owe it that my burnt-out eyes
        Know only memories of the sun.
        In vain I've tried to find the pole
        And the equator-line of space.
        I know not by what burning gaze
        The wings were molten from my soul.
        By love of beauty singed, I fall
        Yet fail the honour and the bliss
        To give my name to the abyss
        Which serves me for my tomb and pall.
                                   X
                               _The Lid_
        Wherever Man may go, by earth or ocean,
        Beneath a sky of fire, or sun snow-cold,
        Whether to Christ or Venus his devotion,
        In gloomy want, or glittering with gold;
        Citizen, vagabond, stamplicker, farmer,
        Be his small brain slow-witted, quick, or sly,
        For this strange terror he can find no armour
        Nor look to heaven save with trembling eye.
        Above, the Sky, that cellar-ceiling, stifles,
        Lit up for comic farce, where struts and trifles
        Each mummer on a floor of blood and mire.
        Terror of rakes, the crazy hermits' hope--
        Beneath its cauldron-lid mankind must grope,
        Never above its margin to aspire.

                             _Pagan Prayer_
        Don't stint the fires with which you flare.
        Warm up my dull heart to delight,
        O Pleasure, torture of the sprite,
        O Goddess, hear my fervent prayer!
        Goddess, who through the ether pass,
        Flame in this subterranean hole!
        Raise up a chilled and stricken soul
        Who lifts to you his peal of brass.
        O Pleasure, always be my queen!
        In flesh and velvet to be seen,
        Mask your beauty like a siren:
        Or else my soul with sleep environ
        Drained from the formless mystic wine,
        Elastic phantom! which is thine.
                                  XII
                          _The Moon Offended_
        O moon, to whom our fathers used to pray,
        From your blue home, where, odalisques of light,
        The stars will follow you in spruce array,
        Old Cynthia, lantern of our dens by night,
        Do you see sleeping lovers on their couches
        Reveal the cool enamel of their teeth:
        The poet at his labours, how he crouches:
        And vipers--how they couple on the heath?
        In yellow domino, with stealthy paces,
        Do you yet steal with clandestine embraces
        To clasp Endymion's pale, millenial charm?
        --`I see your mother, by her mirror, buckled
        By weight of years, poor child of death and harm!
        Patching with art the breast at which you suckled!`
                                  XIII
                    _To ThÃ©odore de Banville, 1842_
        Your hands have seized the goddess by the hair
        In such a grasp, so finally and fully,
        One thinks of some Herculean young Bully
        Flooring his mistress with a lordly air.
        With clear eyes radiant with precocious fire,
        You've shown such pride in architecture fine
        And such a pure audacity of line--
        One knows to what your manhood will aspire.
        Poet! Our blood, through every pore outpressed,
        Escapes from us as if the Centaur's vest
        Made a funereal rill of every vein;
        One thinks that vest was dyed in vengeful spittle
        Of the two snakes that Hercules, when little,
        Throttled in his two fists till they were slain.
                               CONCLUSION
                            _The Unforeseen_
        Harpagon watched his father slowly dying
        And musing on his white lips as they shrunk,
        Said, `There is lumber in the outhouse lying
        It seems: old boards and junk.`
        Celimene cooed, and said, `How good I am
        And, naturally, God made my looks excell`
        (Her callous heart, thrice-smoked like salted ham,
        Will burn in endless Hell!)
        A smoky scribbler, to himself a beacon,
        Says to the wretch whom he has plunged in shade--
        `Where's the Creator you so loved to speak on,
        The Saviour you portrayed?`
        But best of all I know a certain rogue
        Who yawns and weeps, lamenting night and day
        (Impotent fathead) in the same old brogue,
        `I will be good--one day!`
        The clock says in a whisper, `He is ready
        The damned one, whom I warned of his disaster.
        He's blind, and deaf, and like a wall unsteady,
        Where termites mine the plaster`.
        Then one appeared whom all of them denied
        And said with mocking laughter `To my manger
        You've _all_ come; to the Black Mass I provide
        Not one of you's a stranger.
        You've built me temples in your hearts of sin.
        You've kissed my buttocks in your secret mirth.
        Know me for Satan by this conquering grin,
        As monstrous as the Earth.
        D'you think, poor hypocrites surprised red-handed,
        That you can trick your lord without a hitch;
        And that by guile two prizes can be landed--
        Heaven, and being rich?
        The wages of the huntsman is his quarry,
        Which pays him for the chills he gets while stalking.
        Companions of my revels grim and sorry
        I am going to take you walking,
        Down through the denseness of the soil and rock,
        Down through the dust and ash you leave behind,
        Into a palace, built in one sole block,
        Of stone that is not kind:
        For it is built of Universal Sin
        And holds of me all that is proud and glorious`.
        --Meanwhile an angel, far above the din,
        Sends forth a peal victorious
        For all whose hearts can say, `I bless thy rod;
        And blessÃ¨d be the griefs that on us fall.
        My soul is but a toy, Eternal God,
        Thy wisdom all in all!`
        And so deliciously that trumpet blows
        On evenings of celestial harvestings,
        It makes a rapture in the hearts of those
        Whose love and praise it sings.

Learning that his wife had been conducting a passionate affair with Vita (to the enraged jealousy of Vitaâs other lover, Virginia Woolf), Campbell began to see the three aspects of the new elite --sexual inversion, anti-patriotism, and progressive politics -- as aspects of a single frame of mind. These three qualities amounted, for Campbell, to a refusal to grow up. The new elite, in Campbellâs opinion, lived as bloodless parasites on their social inferiors and moral betters; they jettisoned real responsibilities in favor of utopian fantasies and flattered themselves that their precious sensibilities were signs of moral refinement, rather than the marks of a fastidious narcissism.

                               BAUDELAIRE</p>
<p>                           _A translation of_</p>
<p>                           LES FLEURS DU MAL</p>

                              ROY CAMPBELL</p>
<p>                          _Translator's Note_</p>
<p>These poems have been known to four generations, ever since they were first popularised by Swinburne, as the _Flowers of Evil_, but "Flowers of Sickness," "Flowers of Anguish" or "Flowers of Pain" would better describe a great many of them than "Flowers of Evil", since the word _mal_ covers all these interpretations.</p>
<p>Having had considerable success with my translation of a Saint, St. John of the Cross, I determined to translate a fellow-sinner who is hardly less a believer, even in his rebellious and blasphemous moments, than the Saint himself. I have been reading Baudelaire since I was fifteen, carried him in my haversack through two wars, and loved him longer and more deeply than any other poet. I translated St. John of the Cross because he miraculously saved my life in Toledo in 1936. I am translating Baudelaire because he lived my life up to the same age, with similar sins, remorses, ostracisms, and poverty and the same desperate hope of reconciliation and pardon: and I may say to him as Manuel Barbosa du Bocage said to Luis de Camoes,</p>
<p>        "And though in shame and all precarious shifts<br />
         You were my Model--mine's the crowning sorrow,<br />
         To share your luck, but lack your towering gifts."</p>
<p>I have tried to be as colloquial as possible, though I had to come down to _Thou_ and _Thee_ in the translation of his Latin poem in imitation of a Mediaeval hymn. I have also avoided Cockney rhymes as far as was possible for an r-less colonial to do. Poetic abbreviations like _o'er_, _ere_, _mid_, etc., I have generally avoided, in spite of their metrical convenience, since they long ago fell out of vernacular use, and therefore impair the sense of reality in a poem or the translation of one.</p>
<p>I beg the reader's indulgence if I have erred on the slangy side: but I feared to offend my great original who had a horror of the pompously poetic.</p>
<p>If I have not made as good a translation of Baudelaire as in the case of San Juan it will not be so much from lack of striving but for want of supernatural aid for in the latter case the Saint only needed to raise his stick and say "_ArrÃ© burro!_" ("Gee up, donkey!") to me--and the Donkey trotted.</p>

<p>                            _To the Reader_</p>
<p>        Folly and error, avarice and vice,<br />
        Employ our souls and waste our bodies' force.<br />
        As mangey beggars incubate their lice,<br />
        We nourish our innocuous remorse.</p>
<p>        Our sins are stubborn, craven our repentance.<br />
        For our weak vows we ask excessive prices.<br />
        Trusting our tears will wash away the sentence,<br />
        We sneak off where the muddy road entices.</p>
<p>        Cradled in evil, that Thrice-Great Magician,<br />
        The Devil, rocks our souls, that can't resist;<br />
        And the rich metal of our own volition<br />
        Is vaporised by that sage alchemist.</p>
<p>        The Devil pulls the strings by which we're worked:<br />
        By all revolting objects lured, we slink<br />
        Hellwards; each day down one more step we're jerked<br />
        Feeling no horror, through the shades that stink.</p>
<p>        Just as a lustful pauper bites and kisses<br />
        The scarred and shrivelled breast of an old whore,<br />
        We steal, along the roadside, furtive blisses,<br />
        Squeezing them, like stale oranges, for more.</p>
<p>        Packed tight, like hives of maggots, thickly seething,<br />
        Within our brains a host of demons surges.<br />
        Deep down into our lungs at every breathing,<br />
        Death flows, an unseen river, moaning dirges.</p>
<p>        If rape or arson, poison, or the knife<br />
        Has wove no pleasing patterns in the stuff<br />
        Of this drab canvas we accept as life--<br />
        It is because we are not bold enough!</p>
<p>        Amongst the jackals, leopards, mongrels, apes,<br />
        Snakes, scorpions, vultures, that with hellish din,<br />
        Squeal, roar, writhe, gambol, crawl, with monstrous shapes,<br />
        In each man's foul menagerie of sin--</p>
<p>        There's one more damned than all. He never gambols,<br />
        Nor crawls, nor roars, but, from the rest withdrawn,<br />
        Gladly of this whole earth would make a shambles<br />
        And swallow up existence with a yawn . . .</p>
<p>        Boredom! He smokes his hookah, while he dreams<br />
        Of gibbets, weeping tears he cannot smother.<br />
        You know this dainty monster, too, it seems--<br />
        Hypocrite reader!--You!--My twin!--My brother!</p>
<p>                            SPLEEN ET IDEAL</p>
<p>                                   I</p>
<p>                             _Benediction_</p>
<p>        When by an edict of the powers supreme<br />
        A poet's born into this world's drab space,<br />
        His mother starts, in horror, to blaspheme<br />
        Clenching her fists at God, who grants her grace.</p>
<p>        "Would that a nest of vipers I'd aborted<br />
        Rather than this absurd abomination.<br />
        Cursed be the night of pleasures vainly sported<br />
        On which my womb conceived my expiation.</p>
<p>        Since of all women I am picked by You<br />
        To be my Mate's aversion and his shame:<br />
        And since I cannot, like a _billet-doux_,<br />
        Consign this stunted monster to the flame,</p>
<p>        I'll turn the hatred, which You load on me,<br />
        On the curst tool through which You work your spite,<br />
        And twist and stunt this miserable tree<br />
        Until it cannot burgeon for the blight."</p>
<p>        She swallows down the white froth of her ire<br />
        And, knowing naught of schemes that are sublime,<br />
        Deep in Gehenna, starts to lay the pyre<br />
        That's consecrated to maternal crime.</p>
<p>        Yet with an unseen Angel for protector<br />
        The outcast waif grows drunken with the sun,<br />
        And finds ambrosia, too, and rosy nectar<br />
        In all he eats or drinks, suspecting none.</p>
<p>        He sings upon his _Via Crucis_, plays<br />
        With winds, and with the clouds exchanges words:<br />
        The Spirit following his pilgrim-ways<br />
        Weeps to behold him gayer than the birds.</p>
<p>        Those he would love avoid him as in fear,<br />
        Or, growing bold to see one so resigned,<br />
        Compete to draw from him a cry or tear,<br />
        And test on him the fierceness of their kind.</p>
<p>        In food or drink that's destined for his taste<br />
        They mix saliva foul with cinders black,<br />
        Drop what he's touched with hypocrite distaste,<br />
        And blame themselves for walking in his track.</p>
<p>        His wife goes crying in the public way<br />
        --"Since fair enough he finds me to adore,<br />
        The part of ancient idols I will play<br />
        And gild myself with coats of molten ore.</p>
<p>        I will get drunk on incense, myrrh, and nard,<br />
        On genuflexions, meat, and heady wine.<br />
        Out of his crazed and wondering regard,<br />
        I'll laugh to steal prerogatives divine.</p>
<p>        When by such impious farces bored at length,<br />
        I'll place my frail strong hand on him, and start,<br />
        With nails like those of harpies in their strength,<br />
        To plough myself a pathway to his heart.</p>
<p>        Like a young bird that trembles palpitating,<br />
        I'll wrench his heart, all crimson, from his chest,<br />
        And to my favourite beast, his hunger sating,<br />
        Will fling it in the gutter with a jest."</p>
<p>        Skyward, to where he sees a Throne blaze splendid,<br />
        The pious Poet lifts his arms on high,<br />
        And the vast lightnings of his soul extended<br />
        Blot out the crowds and tumults from his eye.</p>
<p>        "BlessÃ¨d be You, O God, who give us pain,<br />
        As cure for our impurity and wrong--<br />
        Essence that primes the stalwart to sustain<br />
        Seraphic raptures that were else too strong.</p>
<p>        I know that for the Poet You've a post,<br />
        Where the blest Legions take their ranks and stations,<br />
        Invited to the revels with the host<br />
        Of Virtues, Powers, and Thrones, and Dominations.</p>
<p>        That grief's the sole nobility, I know it,<br />
        Where neither Earth nor Hell can make attacks,<br />
        And that, to deck my mystic crown of poet,<br />
        All times and universes paid their tax.</p>
<p>        But all the gems from old Palmyra lost,<br />
        The ores unmixed, the pearls of the abyss,<br />
        Set by Your hand, could not suffice the cost<br />
        Of such a blazing diadem as this.</p>
<p>        Because it will be only made of light,<br />
        Drawn from the hearth of the essential rays,<br />
        To which our mortal eyes, when burning bright,<br />
        Are but the tarnished mirrors that they glaze."</p>

<p>                            _The Albatross_</p>
<p>        Sometimes for sport the men of loafing crews<br />
        Snare the great albatrosses of the deep,<br />
        The indolent companions of their cruise<br />
        As through the bitter vastitudes they sweep.</p>
<p>        Scarce have they fished aboard these airy kings<br />
        When helpless on such unaccustomed floors,<br />
        They piteously droop their huge white wings<br />
        And trail them at their sides like drifting oars.</p>
<p>        How comical, how ugly, and how meek<br />
        Appears this soarer of celestial snows!<br />
        One, with his pipe, teases the golden beak,<br />
        One, limping, mocks the cripple as he goes.</p>
<p>        The Poet, like this monarch of the clouds,<br />
        Despising archers, rides the storm elate.<br />
        But, stranded on the earth to jeering crowds,<br />
        The great wings of the giant baulk his gait.</p>
<p>                                  III</p>
<p>                              _Elevation_</p>
<p>        Above the valleys and the lakes: beyond<br />
        The woods, seas, clouds and mountain-ranges: far<br />
        Above the sun, the aethers silver-swanned<br />
        With nebulae, and the remotest star,</p>
<p>        My spirit! with agility you move<br />
        Like a strong swimmer with the seas to fight,<br />
        Through the blue vastness furrowing your groove<br />
        With an ineffable and male delight.</p>
<p>        Far from these foetid marshes, be made pure<br />
        In the pure air of the superior sky,<br />
        And drink, like some most exquisite liqueur,<br />
        The fire that fills the lucid realms on high.</p>
<p>        Beyond where cares or boredom hold dominion,<br />
        Which charge our fogged existence with their spleen,<br />
        Happy is he who with a stalwart pinion<br />
        Can seek those fields so shining and serene:</p>
<p>        Whose thoughts, like larks, rise on the freshening breeze,<br />
        Who fans the morning with his tameless wings,<br />
        Skims over life, and understands with ease<br />
        The speech of flowers and other voiceless things.</p>
<p>                                   IV</p>
<p>                           _Correspondences_</p>
<p>        Nature's a temple where each living column,<br />
        At times, gives forth vague words. There Man advances<br />
        Through forest-groves of symbols, strange and solemn,<br />
        Who follow him with their familiar glances.</p>
<p>        As long-drawn echoes mingle and transfuse<br />
        Till in a deep, dark unison they swoon,<br />
        Vast as the night or as the vault of noon--<br />
        So are commingled perfumes, sounds, and hues.</p>
<p>        There can be perfumes cool as children's flesh,<br />
        Like fiddles, sweet, like meadows greenly fresh.<br />
        Rich, complex, and triumphant, others roll</p>
<p>        With the vast range of all non-finite things--<br />
        Amber, musk, incense, benjamin, each sings<br />
        The transports of the senses and the soul.</p>
<p>                                   V</p>
<p>        I love the thought of those old naked days<br />
        When Phoebus gilded torsos with his rays,<br />
        When men and women sported, strong and fleet,<br />
        Without anxiety or base deceit,<br />
        And heaven caressed them, amorously keen<br />
        To prove the health of each superb machine.<br />
        Cybele then was lavish of her guerdon<br />
        And did not find her sons too gross a burden:<br />
        But, like a she-wolf, in her love great-hearted,<br />
        Her full brown teats to all the world imparted.<br />
        Bold, handsome, strong, Man, rightly, might evince<br />
        Pride in the glories that proclaimed him prince--<br />
        Fruits pure of outrage, by the blight unsmitten,<br />
        With firm, smooth flesh that cried out to be bitten.</p>
<p>        Today the Poet, when he would assess<br />
        Those native splendours in the nakedness<br />
        Of man or woman, feels a sombre chill<br />
        Enveloping his spirit and his will.<br />
        He meets a gloomy picture, which he loathes,<br />
        Wherein deformity cries out for clothes.<br />
        Oh comic runts! Oh horror of burlesque!<br />
        Lank, flabby, skewed, pot-bellied, and grotesque!<br />
        Whom their smug god, Utility (poor brats!)<br />
        Has swaddled in his brazen clouts "ersatz"<br />
        As with cheap tinsel. Women tallow-pale,<br />
        Both gnawed and nourished by debauch, who trail<br />
        The heavy burden of maternal vice,<br />
        Or of fecundity the hideous price.</p>
<p>        We have (corrupted nations) it is true<br />
        Beauties the ancient people never knew--<br />
        Sad faces gnawed by cancers of the heart<br />
        And charms which morbid lassitudes impart.<br />
        But these inventions of our tardy muse<br />
        Can't force our ailing peoples to refuse<br />
        Just tribute to the holiness of youth<br />
        With its straightforward mien, its forehead couth,<br />
        The limpid gaze, like running water bright,<br />
        Diffusing, careless, through all things, like the light<br />
        Of azure skies, the birds, the winds, the flowers,<br />
        The songs, and perfumes, and heart-warming powers.</p>
<p>                                   VI</p>
<p>                             _The Beacons_</p>
<p>        Rubens, the grove of ease, Nepenthe's river<br />
        Couch of cool flesh, where Love may never be,<br />
        But where life ever flows and seems to quiver<br />
        As air in heaven, or, in the sea, the sea.</p>
<p>        Da Vinci, dusky mirror and profound,<br />
        Where angels, smiling mystery, appear,<br />
        Shaded by pines and glaciers, that surround<br />
        And seem to shut their country in the rear.</p>
<p>        Rembrandt, sad hospital of murmurs, where<br />
        Adorned alone by one great crucifix,<br />
        From offal-heaps exhales the weeping prayer<br />
        That winter shoots a sunbeam to transfix.</p>
<p>        Vague region, Michaelangelo, where Titans<br />
        Are mixed with Christs: and strong ghosts rise, in crowds,<br />
        To stand bolt upright in the gloom that lightens,<br />
        With gristly talons tearing through their shrouds.</p>
<p>        Rage of the boxer, mischief of the faun,<br />
        Extracting beauty out of blackguards' looks--<br />
        The heart how proud, the man how pinched and drawn--<br />
        Puget the mournful emperor of crooks!</p>
<p>        Watteau, the carnival, where famous hearts<br />
        Go flitting by like butterflies that burn,<br />
        While through gay scenes each chandelier imparts<br />
        A madness to the dancers as they turn.</p>
<p>        Goya's a nightmare full of things unguessed,<br />
        Of foeti stewed on nights of witches' revels.<br />
        Crones ogle mirrors; children scarcely dressed,<br />
        Adjust their hose to tantalise the devils.</p>
<p>        A lake of gore where fallen angels dwell<br />
        Is Delacroix, by firwoods ever fair,<br />
        Where under fretful skies strange fanfares swell<br />
        Like Weber's sighs and heartbeats in the air.</p>
<p>        These curses, blasphemies, and lamentations,<br />
        These ecstasies, tears, cries and soaring psalms--<br />
        Through endless mazes, their reverberations<br />
        Bring, to our mortal hearts, divinest balms.</p>
<p>        A thousand sentinels repeat the cry.<br />
        A thousand trumpets echo. Beacon-tossed<br />
        A thousand summits flare it through the sky,<br />
        A call of hunters in the jungle lost.</p>
<p>        And certainly this is the most sublime<br />
        Proof of our worth and value, Oh Divinity,<br />
        That this great sob rolls on through ageless time<br />
        To die upon the shores of your infinity.</p>
<p>                                  VII</p>
<p>                            _The Sick Muse_</p>
<p>        Alas, poor Muse, what ails you so today?<br />
        Your hollow eyes with midnight visions burn,<br />
        And turn about, in your complexion play<br />
        Madness and horror, cold and taciturn.</p>
<p>        Green succubus and rosy imp--have they<br />
        Poured you both fear and love into one glass?<br />
        Or with his tyrant fist the nightmare, say,<br />
        Submerged you in some fabulous morass?</p>
<p>        I wish that, breathing health, your breast might nourish<br />
        Ever robuster thoughts therein to flourish:<br />
        And that your Christian blood, in rythmic flow,</p>
<p>        With those old polysyllables would chime,<br />
        Where, turn about, reigned Phoebus, sire of rhyme,<br />
        And Pan, the lord of harvests long ago.</p>
<p>                                  VIII</p>
<p>                            _The Venal Muse_</p>
<p>        Muse of my heart, of palaces the lover,<br />
        Where will you, when the blast of winter blows,<br />
        In the black boredom of snowed lights, discover<br />
        A glowing brand to warm your violet toes?</p>
<p>        How will you there revive your marbled skin<br />
        At the chill rays your shutters then disperse?<br />
        The gold of azure heavens will you win<br />
        When empty are your palate and your purse?</p>
<p>        You'll need each evening, then, to earn your bread,<br />
        As choirboys swinging censers that are dead<br />
        Who sing _Te Deums_ which they disbelieve:</p>
<p>        Or, fasting pierrette, trade your loveliness<br />
        And laughter, soaked in tears that none can guess,<br />
        The boredom of the vulgar to relieve.</p>
<p>                                   IX</p>
<p>                            _The Evil Monk_</p>
<p>        The walls of cloisters on their frescoed lath<br />
        Displayed, in pictures, sacred truths of old,<br />
        Whose sight would warm the entrails of one's faith<br />
        To temper their austerity and cold.</p>
<p>        In times when every sowing flowered for Christ<br />
        Lived famous monks, now out of memory's reach;<br />
        The graveyard for their library sufficed,<br />
        And Death was glorified in simple speech.</p>
<p>        My soul's a grave, where, evil cenobite,<br />
        To all eternity I have been banned.<br />
        Nothing adorns this cloister full of spite.</p>
<p>        O idle monk! Say, to what end were planned<br />
        The living spectacle of my sad plight,<br />
        Love of my eye, or labour of my hand?</p>
<p>                                   X</p>
<p>                              _The Enemy_</p>
<p>        My youth was but a tempest, dark and savage,<br />
        Through which, at times, a dazzling sun would shoot.<br />
        The thunder and the rain have made such ravage<br />
        My garden is nigh bare of rosy fruit.</p>
<p>        Now I have reached the Autumn of my thought,<br />
        And spade and rake must toil the land to save,<br />
        That fragments of my flooded fields be sought<br />
        From where the water sluices out a grave.</p>
<p>        Who knows if the new flowers my dreams prefigure,<br />
        In this washed soil should find, as by a sluit,<br />
        The mystic nourishment to give them vigour?</p>
<p>        Time swallows up our life, O ruthless rigour!<br />
        And the dark foe that nibbles our heart's root,<br />
        Grows on our blood the stronger and the bigger!</p>
<p>                                   XI</p>
<p>                               _Ill Luck_</p>
<p>        So huge a burden to support<br />
        Your courage, Sisyphus, would ask;<br />
        Well though my heart attacks its task,<br />
        Yet Art is long and Time is short.</p>
<p>        Far from the famed memorial arch<br />
        Towards a lonely grave I come.<br />
        My heart in its funereal march<br />
        Goes beating like a muffled drum.</p>
<p>        --Yet many a gem lies hidden still<br />
        Of whom no pick-axe, spade, or drill<br />
        The lonely secrecy invades;</p>
<p>        And many a flower, to heal regret,<br />
        Pours forth its fragrant secret yet<br />
        Amidst the solitary shades.</p>
<p>                                  XII</p>
<p>                             _Former Life_</p>
<p>        I've lived beneath huge portals where marine<br />
        Suns coloured, with a myriad fires, the waves;<br />
        At eve majestic pillars made the scene<br />
        Resemble those of vast basaltic caves.</p>
<p>        The breakers, rolling the reflected skies,<br />
        Mixed, in a solemn, enigmatic way,<br />
        The powerful symphonies they seem to play<br />
        With colours of the sunset in my eyes.</p>
<p>        There did I live in a voluptuous calm<br />
        Where breezes, waves, and splendours roved as vagrants;<br />
        And naked slaves, impregnated with fragrance,</p>
<p>        Would fan my forehead with their fronds of palm:<br />
        Their only charge was to increase the anguish<br />
        Of secret grief in which I loved to languish.</p>
<p>                                  XIII</p>
<p>                         _Gipsies on the Road_</p>
<p>        The tribe of seers, last night, began its march<br />
        With burning eyes, and shouldering its young<br />
        To whose ferocious appetites it swung<br />
        The wealth of hanging breasts that nought can parch.</p>
<p>        The men, their weapons glinting in the rays,<br />
        Walk by the convoy where their folks are carted,<br />
        Sweeping the far-off skylines with a gaze<br />
        Regretful of Chimeras long-departed.</p>
<p>        Out of his hole the cricket sees them pass<br />
        And sings the louder. Greener grows the grass<br />
        Because Cybele loves them, and has made</p>
<p>        The barren rock to gush, the sands to flower,<br />
        To greet these travellers, before whose power<br />
        Familiar futures open realms of shade.</p>

<p>                           _Man and the Sea_</p>
<p>        Free man, you'll always love the sea--for this,<br />
        That it's a mirror, where you see your soul<br />
        In its eternal waves that chafe and roll;<br />
        Nor is your soul less bitter an abyss.</p>
<p>        In your reflected image there to merge,<br />
        You love to dive, its eyes and limbs to match.<br />
        Sometimes your heart forgets its own, to catch<br />
        The rhythm of that wild and tameless dirge.</p>
<p>        The two of you are shadowy, deep, and wide.<br />
        Man! None has ever plummeted your floor--<br />
        Sea! None has ever known what wealth you store--<br />
        Both are so jealous of the things you hide!</p>
<p>        Yet age on age is ended, or begins,<br />
        While you without remorse or pity fight.<br />
        So much in death and carnage you delight,<br />
        Eternal wrestlers! Unrelenting twins!</p>
<p>                                   XV</p>
<p>                           _Don Juan in Hell_</p>
<p>        When, having reached the subterranean wave,<br />
        Don Juan paid his passage from the shore,<br />
        Proud as Antisthenes, a surly knave<br />
        With vengeful arms laid hold of either oar.</p>
<p>        With hanging breasts between their mantles showing<br />
        Sad women, writhing under the black sky,<br />
        Made, as they went, the sound of cattle lowing<br />
        As from a votive herd that's led to die.</p>
<p>        Sganarelle for his wages seemed to linger,<br />
        And laughed; while to the dead assembled there,<br />
        Don Luis pointed out with trembling finger<br />
        The son who dared to flout his silver hair.</p>
<p>        Chilled in her crÃªpe, the chaste and thin Elvira,<br />
        Standing up close to her perfidious spouse,<br />
        Seemed to be pleading from her old admirer<br />
        For that which thrilled his first, unbroken vows.</p>
<p>        A great stone man in armour leaped aboard;<br />
        Seizing the helm, the coal-black wave he cleft.<br />
        But the calm hero, leaning on his sword,<br />
        Had eyes for nothing but the wake they left.</p>
<p>                                  XVI</p>
<p>                       _The Punishment of Pride_</p>
<p>        When first Theology in her young prime<br />
        Flourished with vigour, in that wondrous time,<br />
        Of an illustrious Doctor it was said<br />
        That, having forced indifferent hearts to shed<br />
        Tears of emotion, moved to depths profound:<br />
        And having to celestial glory found<br />
        Marvellous paths, to his own self unknown,<br />
        Where only purest souls had fared alone--<br />
        Like a man raised too high, as in a panic,<br />
        Crazed with a vertigo of pride satanic,<br />
        He cried "Poor Christ, I've raised you to renown!<br />
        But had I wished to bring you crashing down<br />
        Probing your flaws, your shame would match your pride<br />
        And you'd be but a foetus to deride!"</p>
<p>        Immediately he felt his wits escape,<br />
        That flash of sunlight veiled itself in crÃªpe.<br />
        All chaos through his intellect was rolled,<br />
        A temple once, containing hoards of gold,<br />
        By opulence and order well controlled,<br />
        And topped with ceilings splendid to behold.<br />
        Silence and night installed their reign in him.<br />
        It seemed he was a cellar dank and dim,<br />
        To which no living man could find the key;<br />
        And from that day a very beast was he.<br />
        And while he wandered senseless on his way,<br />
        Not knowing spring from summer, night from day,<br />
        Foul, dirty, useless, and with no hereafter,<br />
        He served the children as a butt for laughter.</p>

<p>                                _Beauty_</p>
<p>        I'm fair, O mortals, as a dream of stone;<br />
        My breasts whereon, in turn, your wrecks you shatter,<br />
        Were made to wake in poets' hearts alone<br />
        A love as indestructible as matter.</p>
<p>        A sky-throned sphinx, unknown yet, I combine<br />
        The cygnet's whiteness with a heart of snow.<br />
        I loathe all movement that displaces line,<br />
        And neither tears nor laughter do I know.</p>
<p>        Poets before my postures, which I seem<br />
        To learn from masterpieces, love to dream<br />
        And there in austere thought consume their days.</p>
<p>        I have, these docile lovers to subject,<br />
        Mirrors that glorify all they reflect--<br />
        These eyes, great eyes, eternal in their blaze!</p>

<p>        It's not with smirking beauties of vignettes,<br />
        The shopsoiled products of a worthless age,<br />
        With buskined feet and hands for castaÃ±ets--<br />
        A heart like mine its longing could assuage.</p>
<p>        I leave Gavarni, poet of chloroses,<br />
        His twittering flock, anaemic and unreal.<br />
        I could not find among such bloodless roses,<br />
        A flower to match my crimson-hued ideal.</p>
<p>        To this heart deeper than the deepest canyon,<br />
        Lady Macbeth would be a fit companion,<br />
        Crime-puissant dream of Aeschylus; or you,</p>
<p>        Daughter of Buonarroti, stately Night!<br />
        Whose charms to suit a Titan's appetite,<br />
        You twist, so strange, yet peaceful, to the view.</p>

<p>                             _The Giantess_</p>
<p>        Of old when Nature, in her verve defiant,<br />
        Conceived each day some birth of monstrous mien,<br />
        I would have lived near some young female giant<br />
        Like a voluptuous cat beside a queen;</p>
<p>        To see her body flowering with her soul<br />
        Freely develop in her mighty games,<br />
        And in the mists that through her gaze would roll<br />
        Guess that her heart was hatching sombre flames;</p>
<p>        To roam her mighty contours as I please,<br />
        Ramp on the cliff of her tremendous knees,<br />
        And in the solstice, when the suns that kill</p>
<p>        Make her stretch out across the land and rest,<br />
        To sleep beneath the shadow of her breast<br />
        Like a hushed village underneath a hill.</p>

<p>                               _The Mask_</p>
<p>               (An allegoric statue in Renaissance style)</p>
<p>                    TO ERNEST CHRISTOPHE, _sculptor_</p>
<p>        Study with me this Florentinian treasure,<br />
        Whose undulous and muscular design<br />
        Welds Grace with Strength in sisterhood divine;<br />
        A marvel only wonderment can measure,<br />
        Divinely strong, superbly slim and fine,<br />
        She's formed to reign upon a bed of pleasure<br />
        And charm some prince or pontiff in his leisure.</p>
<p>        See, too, her smile voluptuously shine,<br />
        Where sheer frivolity displays its sign:<br />
        That lingering look of languor, guile, and cheek,<br />
        The dainty face, which veils of gauze enshrine,<br />
        That seems in conquering accents thus to speak:--</p>
<p>        "Pleasure commands me. Love my brow has crowned!"<br />
        Enamouring our thoughts in humble duty,<br />
        True majesty with merriment is found.<br />
        Approach, let's take a turn about her beauty.<br />
        O blasphemy! Dread shock! Our hopes to pique,<br />
        This lovely body, promising delight,<br />
        Ends at the top in a two-headed freak.</p>
<p>        But no! it's just a mask that tricked our sight,<br />
        Fooling us with that exquisite grimace:<br />
        On the reverse you see her proper face,<br />
        Fiercely convulsed, in its true self revealed,<br />
        Which from our sight that lying mask concealed.<br />
        --O sad great beauty! The grand river, fed<br />
        By your rich tears, debouches in my heart.<br />
        Though I am rapt with your deceptive art,<br />
        My soul is slaked upon the tears you shed.</p>
<p>        And yet why does she weep? Such peerless grace<br />
        Could trample down the conquered human race.<br />
        What evil gnaws her flank so strong and sleek?</p>
<p>        She weeps because she's lived, and that she lives.<br />
        Madly she weeps for that. But more she grieves<br />
        (And at the knees she trembles and goes weak)<br />
        Because tomorrow she must live, and then<br />
        The next day, and forever--like us men.</p>

<p>                            _Hymn to Beauty_</p>
<p>        Did you spring out of heaven or the abyss,<br />
        Beauty? Your gaze infernal, yet divine,<br />
        Spreads infamy and glory, grief and bliss,<br />
        And therefore you can be compared to wine.</p>
<p>        Your eyes contain both sunset and aurora:<br />
        You give off scents, like evenings storm-deflowered:<br />
        Your kisses are a philtre: an amphÃ³ra<br />
        Your mouth, that cows the brave, and spurs the coward.</p>
<p>        Climb you from gulfs, or from the stars descend?<br />
        Fate, like a fawning hound, to heel you've brought;<br />
        You scatter joy and ruin without end,<br />
        Ruling all things, yet answering for naught.</p>
<p>        You trample men to death, and mock their clamour.<br />
        Amongst your gauds pale Horror gleams and glances,<br />
        And Murder, not the least of them in glamour,<br />
        On your proud belly amorously dances.</p>
<p>        The dazzled insect seeks your candle-rays,<br />
        Crackles, and burns, and seems to bless his doom.<br />
        The groom bent o'er his bride as in a daze,<br />
        Seems, like a dying man, to stroke his tomb.</p>
<p>        What matter if from hell or heaven born,<br />
        Tremendous monster, terrible to view?<br />
        Your eyes and smile reveal to me, like morn,<br />
        The Infinite I love but never knew.</p>
<p>        From God or Fiend? Siren or Sylph? Invidious<br />
        The answer--Fay with eyes of velvet, ray,<br />
        Rhythm, and perfume!--if you make less hideous<br />
        Our universe, less tedious leave our day.</p>

<p>                            _Exotic Perfume_</p>
<p>        When I, with eyes shut, on warm autumn eves,<br />
        The fragrance of your warmer breast respire,<br />
        I see a country bathed in solar fire<br />
        Whose happy shores its lustre never leaves;</p>
<p>        An isle of indolence, where nature raises<br />
        Singular trees and fruits both sweet and tender,<br />
        Where men have bodies vigorous and slender<br />
        And women's eyes a candour that amazes.</p>
<p>        Led by your scent to fairer climes at last,<br />
        I see a port of sails, where every mast<br />
        Seems weary of the labours of its cruise;</p>
<p>        While scents of tamarind, blown here and there,<br />
        Swelling my nostrils as they rinse the air,<br />
        Are mingled with the chanties of the crews.</p>
<p>                                 XXIII</p>
<p>                               _Her Hair_</p>
<p>        O fleece that down her nape rolls, plume on plume!<br />
        O curls! O scent of nonchalance and ease!<br />
        What ecstacy! To populate this room<br />
        With memories it harbours in its gloom,<br />
        I'd shake it like a banner on the breeze.</p>
<p>        Hot Africa and languid Asia play<br />
        (An absent world, defunct, and far away)<br />
        Within that scented forest, dark and dim.<br />
        As other souls on waves of music swim,<br />
        Mine on its perfume sails, as on the spray.</p>
<p>        I'll journey there, where man and sap-filled tree<br />
        Swoon in hot light for hours. Be you my sea,<br />
        Strong tresses! Be the breakers and gales<br />
        That waft me. Your black river holds, for me,<br />
        A dream of masts and rowers, flames and sails.</p>
<p>        A port, resounding there, my soul delivers<br />
        With long deep draughts of perfumes, scent, and clamour,<br />
        Where ships, that glide through gold and purple rivers,<br />
        Fling wide their vast arms to embrace the glamour<br />
        Of skies wherein the heat forever quivers.</p>
<p>        I'll plunge my head in it, half drunk with pleasure--<br />
        In this black ocean that engulfs her form.<br />
        My soul, caressed with wavelets there may measure<br />
        Infinite rockings in embalmÃ¨d leisure,<br />
        Creative idleness that fears no storm!</p>
<p>        Blue tresses, like a shadow-stretching tent,<br />
        You shed the blue of heavens round and far.<br />
        Along its downy fringes as I went<br />
        I reeled half-drunken to confuse the scent<br />
        Of oil of coconuts, with musk and tar.</p>
<p>        My hand forever in your mane so dense,<br />
        Rubies and pearls and sapphires there will sow,<br />
        That you to my desire be never slow--<br />
        Oasis of my dreams, and gourd from whence<br />
        Deep-draughted wines of memory will flow.</p>
<p>                                  XXIV</p>
<p>        More than night's vault, it's you that I adore,<br />
        Vessel of sorrow, silent one, the more<br />
        Because you flee from me, and seem to place,<br />
        Ornament of my nights! more leagues of space<br />
        Ironically between me and you<br />
        Than part me from these vastitudes of blue.</p>
<p>        I charge, attack, and mount to the assault<br />
        As worms attack a corpse within a vault.<br />
        And cherish even the coldness that you boast,<br />
        By which, harsh beast, you subjugate me most.</p>
<p>                                  XXV</p>
<p>        You'd stick the world into your bedside lane.<br />
        It's boredom makes you callous to all pain.<br />
        To exercise your teeth for this strange task,<br />
        A heart upon a rake, each day, you'd ask.<br />
        Your eyes lit up like shopfronts, or the trees<br />
        With lanterns on the night of public sprees,<br />
        Make insolent misuse of borrowed power<br />
        And scorn the law of beauty that's their dower.</p>
<p>        Oh deaf-and-dumb machine, harm-breeding fool<br />
        World sucking leech, yet salutary tool!<br />
        Have you not seen your beauties blanch to pass<br />
        Before their own reflection in the glass?<br />
        Before this pain, in which you think you're wise,<br />
        Does not its greatness shock you with surprise,<br />
        To think that Nature, deep in projects hidden,<br />
        Has chosen you, vile creature of the midden,<br />
        To knead a genius for succeeding time.</p>
<p>        O sordid grandeur! Infamy sublime!</p>
<p>                                  XXVI</p>
<p>                           _Sed non Satiata_</p>
<p>        Strange goddess, brown as evening to the sight,<br />
        Whose scent is half of musk, half of havanah,<br />
        Work of some obi, Faust of the Savanah,<br />
        Ebony witch, and daughter of the night.</p>
<p>        By far preferred to troth, or drugs, or sleep,<br />
        Love vaunts the red elixir of your mouth.<br />
        My caravan of longings seeks in drouth<br />
        Your eyes, the wells at which my cares drink deep.</p>
<p>        Through those black eyes, by which your soul respires,<br />
        Pitiless demon! pour less scorching fires.<br />
        I am no Styx nine times with flame to wed.</p>
<p>        Nor can I turn myself to Proserpine<br />
        To break your spell, Megera libertine!<br />
        Within the dark inferno of your bed.</p>
<p>                                 XXVII</p>
<p>        With waving opalescence in her gown,<br />
        Even when she walks along, you think she's dancing.<br />
        Like those long snakes which charmers, while entrancing,<br />
        Wave with their wands, in cadence, up and down.</p>
<p>        Like the sad sands of deserts and their skies,<br />
        By human sufferings untouched and free,<br />
        Or like the surfy curtains of the sea,<br />
        She flaunts a cold indifference. Her eyes</p>
<p>        Are made of charming minerals well-burnished.<br />
        Her nature, both by sphynx and angel furnished,<br />
        Is old, intact, symbolic, and bizarre:</p>
<p>        She seems, made all of gems, steel, light, and gold,<br />
        In barrenness, majestic, hard, and cold,<br />
        To blaze forever, like a useless star.</p>
<p>                                 XXVIII</p>
<p>                        _The Snake that Dances_</p>
<p>        I love to watch, while you are lazing,<br />
          Your skin. It iridesces<br />
        Like silk or satin, smoothly-glazing<br />
          The light that it caresses.</p>
<p>        Under your tresses dark and deep<br />
          Where acrid perfumes drown,<br />
        A fragrant sea whose breakers sweep<br />
          In mazes blue or brown,</p>
<p>        My soul, a ship, to the attraction<br />
          Of breezes that bedizen<br />
        Its swelling canvas, clears for action<br />
          And seeks a far horizon.</p>
<p>        Your eyes where nothing can be seen<br />
          Either of sweet or bitter<br />
        But gold and iron mix their sheen,<br />
          Seem frosty gems that glitter.</p>
<p>        To see you rhythmically advancing<br />
          Seems to my fancy fond<br />
        As if it were a serpent dancing<br />
          Waved by the charmer's wand.</p>
<p>        Under the languorous moods that weigh it,<br />
          Your childish head bows down:<br />
        Like a young elephant's you sway it<br />
          With motions soft as down.</p>
<p>        Your body leans upon the hips<br />
          Like a fine ship that laves<br />
        Its hull from side to side, and dips<br />
          Its yards into the waves.</p>
<p>        When, as by glaciers ground, the spate<br />
          Swells hissing from beneath,<br />
        The water of your mouth, elate,<br />
          Rises between your teeth--</p>
<p>        It seems some old Bohemian vintage<br />
          Triumphant, fierce, and tart,<br />
        A liquid heaven that showers a mintage<br />
          Of stars across my heart.</p>
<p>                                  XXIX</p>
<p>                             _The Carcase_</p>
<p>        The object that we saw, let us recall,<br />
        This summer morn when warmth and beauty mingle--<br />
        At the path's turn, a carcase lay asprawl<br />
            Upon a bed of shingle.</p>
<p>        Legs raised, like some old whore far-gone in passion.<br />
        The burning, deadly, poison-sweating mass<br />
        Opened its paunch in careless, cynic fashion,<br />
            Ballooned with evil gas.</p>
<p>        On this putrescence the sun blazed in gold,<br />
        Cooking it to a turn with eager care--<br />
        So to repay to Nature, hundredfold,<br />
            What she had mingled there.</p>
<p>        The sky, as on the opening of a flower,<br />
        On this superb obscenity smiled bright.<br />
        The stench drove at us, with such fearsome power<br />
            You thought you'd swoon outright.</p>
<p>        Flies trumpeted upon the rotten belly<br />
        Whence larvae poured in legions far and wide,<br />
        And flowed, like molten and liquescent jelly,<br />
            Down living rags of hide.</p>
<p>        The mass ran down, or, like a wave elated<br />
        Rolled itself on, and crackled as if frying:<br />
        You'd think that corpse, by vague breath animated,<br />
            Drew life from multiplying.</p>
<p>        Through that strange world a rustling rumour ran<br />
        Like rushing water or a gust of air,<br />
        Or grain that winnowers, with rhythmic fan,<br />
            Sweep simmering here and there.</p>
<p>        It seemed a dream after the forms grew fainter,<br />
        Or like a sketch that slowly seems to dawn<br />
        On a forgotten canvas, which the painter<br />
            From memory has drawn.</p>
<p>        Behind the rocks a restless cur that slunk<br />
        Eyed us with fretful greed to recommence<br />
        His feast, amidst the bonework, on the chunk<br />
            That he had torn from thence.</p>
<p>        Yet you'll resemble this infection too<br />
        One day, and stink and sprawl in such a fashion,<br />
        Star of my eyes, sun of my nature, you,<br />
            My angel and my passion!</p>
<p>        Yes, you must come to this, O queen of graces,<br />
        At length, when the last sacraments are over,<br />
        And you go down to moulder in dark places<br />
            Beneath the grass and clover.</p>
<p>        Then tell the vermin as it takes its pleasance<br />
        And feasts with kisses on that face of yours,<br />
        I've kept intact in form and godlike essence<br />
            Our decomposed amours!</p>
<p>                                  XXX</p>
<p>                         _De Profundis Clamavi_</p>
<p>        Have pity, my one love and sole delight!<br />
        Down to a dark abyss my heart has sounded,<br />
        A mournful world, by grey horizons bounded,<br />
        Where blasphemy and horror swim by night.</p>
<p>        For half the year a heatless sun gives light,<br />
        The other half the night obscures the earth.<br />
        The arctic regions never knew such dearth.<br />
        No woods, nor streams, nor creatures meet the sight.</p>
<p>        No horror in the world could match in dread<br />
        The cruelty of that dire sun of frost,<br />
        And that huge night like primal chaos spread.</p>
<p>        I envy creatures of the vilest kind<br />
        That they in stupid slumber can be lost--<br />
        So slowly does the skein of time unwind!</p>
<p>                                  XXXI</p>
<p>                             _The Vampire_</p>
<p>        You, who like a dagger ploughed<br />
        Into my heart with deadly thrill:<br />
        You who, stronger than a crowd<br />
        Of demons, mad, and dressed to kill,</p>
<p>        Of my dejected soul have made<br />
        Your bed, your lodging, and domain:<br />
        To whom I'm linked (Unseemly Jade!)<br />
        As is a convict to his chain,</p>
<p>        Or as the gamester to his dice,<br />
        Or as the drunkard to his dram,<br />
        Or as the carrion to its lice--<br />
        I curse you. Would my curse could damn!</p>
<p>        I have besought the sudden blade<br />
        To win for me my freedom back.<br />
        Perfidious poison I have prayed<br />
        To help my cowardice. Alack!</p>
<p>        Both poison and the sword disdained<br />
        My cowardice, and seemed to say<br />
        "You are not fit to be unchained<br />
        From your damned servitude. Away,</p>
<p>        You imbecile! since if from her empire<br />
        We were to liberate the slave,<br />
        You'd raise the carrion of your vampire,<br />
        By your own kisses, from the grave."</p>
<p>                                 XXXII</p>
<p>        One night when, near a fearful Jewess lying,<br />
        As one corpse by another corpse, I sprawled--<br />
        Beside the venal body I was buying,<br />
        The beauty that was absent I recalled.</p>
<p>        I pictured you in native majesty<br />
        With glances full of energy and grace,<br />
        Your hair, a perfumed casque, whose memory<br />
        Revives me for the amorous embrace.</p>
<p>        For madly I'd have kissed your noble frame,<br />
        And from your cool feet to your great black tresses<br />
        Unleashed the treasure of profound caresses,</p>
<p>        If with a single tear that gently came<br />
        You could have quenched, O queen of all the cruel!<br />
        The blazing of your eyes, their icy fuel.</p>
<p>                                 XXXIII</p>
<p>                          _Posthumous Remorse_</p>
<p>        When you're asleep, dear shadow-coloured wench,<br />
        Within a coal-black, marble monument:<br />
        When, for your room and mansion, you are pent<br />
        In a wet cellar and a hollow trench:</p>
<p>        When the stone, pressing on your startled breast<br />
        And flanks in fluent suppleness competing,<br />
        Prevents your heart from wishing or from beating,<br />
        Your feet from racing on their reckless quest.</p>
<p>        The tomb that shares my deathless recollection<br />
        (For poets best are understood by tombs)<br />
        On those long nights, when never sleep presumes,</p>
<p>        Will say, "What boots, frail vase of imperfection,<br />
        Not to have known what pains with death begin?"--<br />
        And, like remorse, the worm will gnaw your skin.</p>
<p>                                 XXXIV</p>
<p>                               _The Cat_</p>
<p>        Come, my fine cat, against my loving heart;<br />
        Sheathe your sharp claws, and settle.<br />
        And let my eyes into your pupils dart<br />
        Where agate sparks with metal.</p>
<p>        Now while my fingertips caress at leisure<br />
        Your head and wiry curves,<br />
        And that my hand's elated with the pleasure<br />
        Of your electric nerves,</p>
<p>        I think about my woman--how her glances<br />
        Like yours, dear beast, deep-down<br />
        And cold, can cut and wound one as with lances;</p>
<p>        Then, too, she has that vagrant<br />
        And subtle air of danger that makes fragrant<br />
        Her body, lithe and brown.</p>
<p>                                  XXXV</p>
<p>                                 _Duel_</p>
<p>        Two fighters rushed together: sabres bleak<br />
        With crimson blood-gouts lit the air above.<br />
        That clinking swordplay was the tender squeak<br />
        Of youth, when it's a prey to bleating love.</p>
<p>        The swords are splintered, like our youth, my darling,<br />
        And now it's teeth and talons are the fashion.<br />
        The clash of swords is child's play to the snarling<br />
        Of hearts adult in ulcerated passion.</p>
<p>        In the ravine by lynx and leopard haunted,<br />
        Our heroes, wrestling heroes, roll undaunted.<br />
        Rags of their skin flower red upon the gorse.</p>
<p>        This gulf is hell, and peopled by our friends.<br />
        Here, hellcat! Come, let's roll without remorse<br />
        To celebrate a feud that never ends!</p>
<p>                                 XXXVI</p>
<p>                             _The Balcony_</p>
<p>        Mother of memories, queen of paramours,<br />
        Yourself are all my pleasure, all my duty;<br />
        You will recall caresses that were yours<br />
        And fireside evenings in their warmth and beauty.<br />
        Mother of memories, queen of paramours.</p>
<p>        On eves illumined by the light of coal,<br />
        The balcony beneath a rose-veiled sky,<br />
        Your breast how soft! Your heart how good and whole!<br />
        We spoke eternal things that cannot die--<br />
        On eves illumined by the light of coal!</p>
<p>        How splendid sets the sun of a warm evening!<br />
        How deep is space! the heart how full of power!<br />
        When, queen of the adored, towards you leaning,<br />
        I breathed the perfume of your blood in flower.<br />
        How splendid sets the sun of a warm evening!</p>
<p>        The evening like an alcove seemed to thicken,<br />
        And as my eyes astrologised your own,<br />
        Drinking your breath, I felt sweet poisons quicken,<br />
        And in my hands your feet slept still as stone.<br />
        The evening like an alcove seemed to thicken.</p>
<p>        I know how to resuscitate dead minutes.<br />
        I see my past, its face hid in your knees.<br />
        How can I seek your languorous charm save in its<br />
        Own source, your heart and body formed to please.<br />
        I know how to resuscitate dead minutes.</p>
<p>        These vows, these perfumes, and these countless kisses,<br />
        Reborn from gulfs that we could never sound,<br />
        Will they, like suns, once bathed in those abysses,<br />
        Rejuvenated from the deep, rebound--<br />
        These vows, these perfumes, and these countless kisses?</p>

<p>                            _The Possessed_</p>
<p>        The sun in crÃªpe has muffled up his fire.<br />
        Moon of my life! Half shade yourself like him.<br />
        Slumber or smoke. Be silent and be dim,<br />
        And in the gulf of boredom plunge entire;</p>
<p>        I love you thus! However, if you like,<br />
        Like some bright star from its eclipse emerging,<br />
        To flaunt with Folly where the crowds are surging--<br />
        Flash, lovely dagger, from your sheath and strike!</p>
<p>        Light up your eyes from chandeliers of glass!<br />
        Light up the lustful looks of louts that pass!<br />
        Morbid or petulant, I thrill before you.</p>
<p>        Be what you will, black night or crimson dawn;<br />
        No fibre of my body tautly-drawn,<br />
        But cries: "Beloved demon, I adore you!"</p>

<p>                               The Shades</p>
<p>        My fate confines me, dark and shady,<br />
        In vaults of lone unfathomed grief.<br />
        No rosy sunbeams bring relief.<br />
        Alone with Night, my grim landlady,</p>
<p>        I'm like a painter whom God spites<br />
        To paint on shades, and cook and eat<br />
        My own poor heart, the only meat<br />
        Of my funereal appetites.</p>
<p>        Sometimes a spectre dim, reclining<br />
        In grace and glory, can be seen.<br />
        With dreamy oriental mien.</p>
<p>        When fully its own form defining,<br />
        I recognise who it must be,<br />
        Sombre yet luminous, it's She!</p>
<p>                                   2</p>
<p>                              The Perfume</p>
<p>        Reader, say, have you ever breathed,<br />
        With lazy greed and joy, the dusk<br />
        Of an old church with incense wreathed,<br />
        Or smelt an ancient bag of musk?</p>
<p>        It's by such charms the Nevermore<br />
        Intoxicates us in the Now--<br />
        As lovers to Remembrance bow<br />
        Over the bodies they adore.</p>
<p>        From her thick tresses as they fume<br />
        (Scent-sack and censer of the room)<br />
        A feline, tawny perfume springs.</p>
<p>        Her muslins and her velvets smooth<br />
        Give off, made pregnant with her youth,<br />
        Scents of the fur of prowling things.</p>
<p>                                   3</p>
<p>                               The Frame</p>
<p>        As a fine frame improves a plate<br />
        Although the graver needs no vaunting--<br />
        I know not what of strange and haunting<br />
        (From nature vast to isolate</p>
<p>        Her beauty) was conferred by gems,<br />
        Metals, and gear. She mingled with them,<br />
        And swirled them all into her rhythm<br />
        As in her skirts the flouncing hems.</p>
<p>        They say she thought all things were stung<br />
        With love for her. Her naked flesh<br />
        She loved to drown in kisses fresh</p>
<p>        Of flax or satin. To her clung,<br />
        In all the movements of her shape,<br />
        The childish graces of the ape.</p>

<p>                              The Portrait</p>
<p>        Sickness and death will form the ash and dust<br />
        Of all the fire we blazed with in such splendour,<br />
        Of those great eyes so fervent and so tender,<br />
        The mouth wherein my heart would drown its lust,</p>
<p>        The kisses strong as marum, the delightful,<br />
        Fierce transports livelier than the solar rays.<br />
        What can remain? My soul, the truth is frightful!--<br />
        A fading sketch, a faint three-coloured haze,</p>
<p>        Which (like myself unfriended) wanes away,<br />
        While Time, insulting dotard, every day,<br />
        Brushes it fainter with his heedless wing . . .</p>
<p>        Killer of life and art! black, evil King!--<br />
        You'll never kill, within my soul, the story<br />
        Of that which was my rapture and my glory.</p>
<p>                                 XXXIX</p>
<p>        For you this poem: if my name should reach<br />
        Favoured by mighty gales, to far-off times,<br />
        Like a proud vessel sailing to the beach,<br />
        To stir the brains of humans with my rhymes--</p>
<p>        Your memory, uncertain as a myth,<br />
        Will tire the reader like an endless gong,<br />
        And be a mystic, kindred chain wherewith<br />
        He'll hang suspended to my towering song:</p>
<p>        Curs'd soul to whom (from the supernal sky<br />
        To hell's abysm) none responds but I!--<br />
        O you, who like a fleeting shadow pass,</p>
<p>        Spurn with light foot and with serenest gaze<br />
        The stupid mortals who have grudged you praise,<br />
        O jade-eyed statue, angel browed with brass!</p>
<p>                                   XL</p>
<p>                             _Semper Eadem_</p>
<p>        "Whence," ask you, "does this strange new sadness flow<br />
        Like rising tides on rocks, black, bare, and vast?"<br />
        For human hearts, when vintage-time is past,<br />
        To live is bad. That secret all men know--</p>
<p>        An obvious sorrow, with no mystery, shown,<br />
        Clear as your joy, to everyone around.<br />
        O curious one, seek nothing more profound,<br />
        And speak not, though your voice be sweet in tone.</p>
<p>        Hush, ignorant! Hush, soul that's still enraptured,<br />
        And mouth of childish laughter! Neatly captured,<br />
        Death pulls us, more than life, with subtle wile.</p>
<p>        Oh let my thought get drunk upon a lie,<br />
        And plunge, as in a dream, in either eye,<br />
        And in their lashes' shadow sleep awhile!</p>
<p>                                  XLI</p>
<p>                              _All in One_</p>
<p>        The Demon called on me this morning,<br />
        In my high room. As is his way,<br />
        Thinking to catch me without warning,<br />
        He put this question: "Tell me, pray,</p>
<p>        Of all the beauties that compose,<br />
        The strange enchantment of her ways,<br />
        Amongst the wonders black or rose,<br />
        Which object most excites your praise,</p>
<p>        And is the climax in her litany?"<br />
        My soul, you answered the Abhorred,<br />
        "Since she is fashioned, all, of dittany,<br />
        No part is most to be adored.</p>
<p>        Since I am ravished, I ignore a<br />
        Degree of difference in delight.<br />
        She dazzles me like the aurora<br />
        And she consoles me like the night.</p>
<p>        The harmony's so exquisite<br />
        That governs her, it is in vain<br />
        Analysis would try to split<br />
        The unity of such a strain.</p>
<p>        O mystic fusion that, enwreathing<br />
        My senses, fuses each in each,<br />
        To hear the music of her breathing<br />
        And breathe the perfume of her speech."</p>
<p>                                  XLII</p>
<p>        What can you say, poor lonely soul of mine,<br />
        Or you, poor heart, so long ago turned sour,<br />
        To the best, dearest, loveliest, whose divine<br />
        Regard has made you open like a flower?</p>
<p>        We'll set our pride to sing her highest praise:<br />
        Naught to her sweet authority compares:<br />
        Her psychic flesh is formed of fragrant airs.<br />
        Her glances clothe us in a suit of rays.</p>
<p>        Be it in solitude at dead of night,<br />
        Or in the crowded streets of glaring light,<br />
        Her phantom like a torch before me streams.</p>
<p>        It speaks: "I'm beautiful. These orders take.<br />
        Love naught but Beauty, always, for my sake,<br />
        Madonna, guardian Angel, Muse of dreams."</p>
<p>                                 XLIII</p>
<p>                           _The Living Torch_</p>
<p>        Those lit eyes go before me, in full view,<br />
        (Some cunning angel magnetised their light)--<br />
        Heavenly twins, yet my own brothers too,<br />
        Shaking their diamond blaze into my sight.</p>
<p>        My steps from every trap or sin to save,<br />
        In the strait road of Beauty they conduct me.<br />
        They are my servants, and I am their slave,<br />
        Obedient in whatever they instruct me.</p>
<p>        Delightful eyes, you burn with mystic rays<br />
        Like candles in broad day; red suns may blaze,<br />
        But cannot quench their still, fantastic light.</p>
<p>        Those candles burn for death, but you for waking:<br />
        You sing the dawn that in my soul is breaking,<br />
        Stars which no sun could ever put to flight!</p>

<p>                            _Reversibility_</p>
<p>        Angel of gaiety, have you known anguish,<br />
        Shame and remorse, tears, boredom, and dismay,<br />
        Vague horrors of the nights in which we languish,<br />
        Which crumple hearts like papers thrown away?<br />
        Angel of gaiety, have you known anguish?</p>
<p>        Angel of kindness, have you met with hate?<br />
        Fists clenched in gloom, eyes running tears of gall,<br />
        When Vengeance beats his drum to subjugate<br />
        Our faculties, the captain of them all?<br />
        Angel of kindness, have you met with hate?</p>
<p>        Angel of health, have you beheld the Fevers?<br />
        Across pale walls of wards they limp and stumble,<br />
        Like exiles wan, with agues, chills, and shivers,<br />
        Seeking the scanty sun with lips that mumble.<br />
        Angel of health, have you beheld the Fevers?</p>
<p>        Angel of beauty, do you know Old Age,<br />
        The fear of wrinkles, and the dire emotion,<br />
        In eyes we've pierced too long, as on a page,<br />
        To read the secret horror of devotion?<br />
        Angel of beauty do you know Old Age?</p>
<p>        Angel of goodness, radiance, and delight,<br />
        The dying David would have begged to share<br />
        The emanations of your body bright.<br />
        But all I wish to ask of you is prayer,<br />
        Angel of goodness, radiance, and delight.</p>
<p>                                  XLV</p>
<p>                              _Confession_</p>
<p>        Once, and once only, kind and gentle lady,<br />
        Your polished arm on mine you placed<br />
        (Deep down within my spirit, dark and shady,<br />
        I keep the memory uneffaced).</p>
<p>        A medal, newly-coined, of flashing silver,<br />
        The full moon shone. The night was old.<br />
        Its solemn grandeur, like a mighty river,<br />
        Through sleeping Paris softly rolled.</p>
<p>        Along the streets, by courtyard doors, cats darted<br />
        And passed in furtive, noiseless flight<br />
        With ears pricked; or, like shades of friends departed,<br />
        Followed us slowly through the night.</p>
<p>        Cutting this easy intimacy through,<br />
        That hatched from out that pearly light--<br />
        O rich resounding instrument, from you,<br />
        Who'd always thrilled with loud delight,</p>
<p>        From you, till then as joyful as a peal<br />
        Of trumpets on a sparkling morn,<br />
        A cry so plaintive that it seemed unreal,<br />
        Was staggeringly torn.</p>
<p>        Like some misborn, deformed, and monstrous kid<br />
        Who puts his family to the blush,<br />
        Whose presence in a cellar must be hid<br />
        And his existence in a hush!</p>
<p>        Poor angel! that harsh note was meant to sing<br />
        "That nothing in this world is certain,<br />
        And human egotism is the thing<br />
        Which all existence serves to curtain.</p>
<p>        That it's an irksome task to be a beauty,<br />
        A boring job one has to face--<br />
        Like frigid dancers, smiling as a duty<br />
        With hard, mechanical grimace:</p>
<p>        That building upon hearts is idiotic:<br />
        All cracks, love, beauty, and fraternity<br />
        Until Oblivion puts them in his pocket<br />
        To pawn them on to old Eternity!"</p>
<p>        I often have recalled that moon of magic,<br />
        That languid hush on quays and marts,<br />
        And then this confidence, so grim and tragic,<br />
        In the confessional of hearts.</p>
<p>                                  XLVI</p>
<p>                            _Spiritual Dawn_</p>
<p>        When in the company of the Ideal<br />
        (That gnawing tooth) Dawn enters, white and pink,<br />
        The rooms of rakes--each sated beast can feel<br />
        An Angel waking through the fumes of drink.</p>
<p>        For downcast Man, who dreams and suffers still,<br />
        The azure of the mystic heaven above,<br />
        With gulf-like vertigo, attracts his will.<br />
        So, Goddess, lucid Being of pure love,</p>
<p>        Over the smoking wreck of feasts and scandals,<br />
        Your phantom, rosy and enchanting, flies<br />
        And still returns to my dilated eyes.</p>
<p>        The sun has blackened out the flame of candles.<br />
        So your victorious phantom seems as one,<br />
        O blazing spirit, with the deathless Sun!</p>

<p>        Now comes the eve, when on its stem vibrates<br />
        Each flower, evaporating like a censer;<br />
        When sounds and scents in the dark air grow denser;<br />
        Drowsed swoon through which a mournful waltz pulsates!</p>
<p>        Each flower evaporates as from a censer;<br />
        The fiddle like a hurt heart palpitates;<br />
        Drowsed swoon through which a mournful waltz pulsates;<br />
        The sad, grand sky grows, altar-like, immenser.</p>
<p>        The fiddle, like a hurt heart, palpitates,<br />
        A heart that hates oblivion, ruthless censor.<br />
        The sad, grand sky grows, altar-like, immenser.<br />
        The sun in its own blood coagulates . . .</p>
<p>        A heart that hates oblivion, ruthless censor.<br />
        The whole of the bright past resuscitates.<br />
        The sun in its own blood coagulates . . .<br />
        And, monstrance-like, your memory flames intenser!</p>

<p>                              _The Flask_</p>
<p>        Perfumes there are which through all things can pass<br />
        And make all matter porous, even glass;<br />
        Old coffers from the Orient brought, whose locks<br />
        Grind sullenly when opening the box,</p>
<p>        Or, in an empty house, some ancient chest,<br />
        Where time and dust and gloom were long compressed,<br />
        May yield a flask where memory survives,<br />
        And a soul flashes into future lives.</p>
<p>        A thousand thoughts, funereal larvae, laid<br />
        Shuddering softly under palls of shade,<br />
        May suddenly their soaring wings unfold,<br />
        Stained azure, glazed with rose, or filmed with gold.</p>
<p>        Intoxicating memory now flies<br />
        Into the dusk, and makes us close our eyes:<br />
        Vertigo draws the spirit which it grips<br />
        Towards some dark miasma of eclipse:</p>
<p>        Beside an ancient pit he makes her fall,<br />
        Where Lazarus, sweet-scented, tears his pall<br />
        And wakes the spectral corpse of some now-cold,<br />
        Rancid, sepulchral love he knew of old.</p>
<p>        So when I'm lost to human memory, thrown<br />
        In some old gloomy chest to lie alone,<br />
        A poor decrepit flask, cracked, abject, crusty<br />
        With dirt, opaque and sticky, damp and dusty,</p>
<p>        I'll be your pall and shroud, beloved pest!<br />
        The witness of your venom, and its test,<br />
        Dear poison, angel-brewed with deadly art--<br />
        Life, death, and dear corrosion of my heart.</p>

<p>                               _Poisons_</p>
<p>        Wine can conceal a sordid room<br />
          In rich, miraculous disguise,<br />
        And make such porticoes arise<br />
          Out of its flushed and crimson fume<br />
        As makes the sunset in the skies.</p>
<p>        Opium the infinite enlarges,<br />
          And lengthens all that is past measure.<br />
        It deepens time, and digs its treasure.<br />
          With sad, black raptures it o'ercharges<br />
        The soul, and surfeits it with pleasure.</p>
<p>        Neither are worth the drug so strong<br />
          That you distil from your green eyes,<br />
        Lakes where I see my soul capsize<br />
          Head downwards: and where, in one throng,<br />
        I slake my dreams, and quench my sighs.</p>
<p>        But to your spittle these seem naught--<br />
          It stings and burns. It steeps my thought<br />
        And spirit in oblivious gloom,<br />
          And, in its dizzy onrush caught,<br />
        Dashes it on the shores of doom.</p>
<p>                                   L</p>
<p>                              _Misty Sky_</p>
<p>        One would have thought your eyes were veiled in haze,<br />
        Strange eyes! (Grey, green, or azure is their gaze?)<br />
        It seems they would reflect, in each renewal,<br />
        The changing skies, dull, dreamy, fond, or cruel.</p>
<p>        You know those days both warm and hazy, which<br />
        Melt into tears the hearts that they bewitch:<br />
        And when the nerves, uneasy to control,<br />
        Too-wide awake, upbraid the sleeping soul.</p>
<p>        You, too, resemble such a lit horizon<br />
        As suns of misty seasons now bedizen . . .<br />
        As you shine out, a landscape fresh with rain<br />
        With misty sunbeams sparkling on the plain.</p>
<p>        Dangerous girl, seductive as the weather!<br />
        Shall I adore your snows and frosts together?<br />
        In your relentless winter shall I feel<br />
        A kiss more sharp than that of ice and steel?</p>

<p>                                   I</p>
<p>        A fine strong gentle cat is prowling<br />
        As in his bedroom, in my brain;<br />
        So soft his voice, so smooth its strain,<br />
        That you can scarcely hear him miowling.</p>
<p>        But should he venture to complain<br />
        Or scold, the voice is rich and deep:<br />
        And thus he manages to keep<br />
        The charm of his untroubled reign.</p>
<p>        This voice, which seems to pearl and filter<br />
        Through my soul's inmost shady nook,<br />
        Fills me with poems, like a book,<br />
        And fortifies me, like a philtre.</p>
<p>        His voice can cure the direst pain<br />
        And it contains the rarest raptures.<br />
        The deepest meanings, which it captures,<br />
        It needs no language to explain.</p>
<p>        There is no bow that can so sweep<br />
        That perfect instrument, my heart:<br />
        Or make more sumptuous music start<br />
        From its most vibrant cord and deep,</p>
<p>        Than can the voice of this strange elf,<br />
        This cat, bewitching and seraphic,<br />
        Subtly harmonious in his traffic<br />
        With all things else, and with himself.</p>
<p>                                   2</p>
<p>        So sweet a perfume seems to swim<br />
        Out of his fur both brown and bright,<br />
        I nearly was embalmed one night<br />
        From (only once) caressing him.</p>
<p>        Familiar Lar of where I stay,<br />
        He rules, presides, inspires and teaches<br />
        All things to which his empire reaches.<br />
        Perhaps he is a god, or fay.</p>
<p>        When to a cherished cat my gaze<br />
        Is magnet-drawn and then returns<br />
        Back to itself, it there discerns,<br />
        With strange excitement and amaze,</p>
<p>        Deep down in my own self, the rays<br />
        Of living opals, torch-like gleams<br />
        And pallid fire of eyes, it seems,<br />
        That fixedly return my gaze.</p>

        Goes rolling in a soft, slow, lazy rhythm.</p>
<p>        Over your tall, round neck and those plump shoulders,<br />

        Triumphant bosom, like a coffer rich<br />
          With bosses round and rare,<br />
        Like shields that draw the lightning from the air.</p>
<p>        Provoking shields, with rosy points uplifted!<br />
        Coffer of secret charms, superbly gifted,<br />
          Whose scents, liqueurs, and wine<br />
        Turn heart and brain deliriously thine.</p>

          Like sorcerers they are<br />
        That stir black philtres in a deep, cool jar.</p>
<p>        Your arms precocious Hercules would grace<br />

        Consider the vista<br />
        Of living out there, you and I.<br />
        To love at our leisure,<br />
        Then, ending our pleasure,<br />
        In climes you resemble to die.<br />
        There the suns, rainy-wet,<br />
        Through clouds rise and set<br />
        With the selfsame enchantment to charm me<br />
        That my senses receive<br />
        From your eyes, that deceive,<br />
        When they shine through your tears to disarm me.</p>
<p>        There'll be nothing but beauty, wealth, pleasure,<br />
        With all things in order and measure.</p>
<p>        With old treasures furnished,<br />
        By centuries burnished,<br />
        To gleam in the shade of our chamber.<br />
        While the rarest of flowers<br />
        Vaguely mix through the hours<br />
        Their own with the perfume of amber:<br />
        Each sumptuous ceiling,<br />
        Each mirror revealing<br />
        The wealth of the East, will be hung<br />
        So the part and the whole<br />
        May speak to the soul<br />
        In its native, indigenous tongue.</p>
<p>        There'll be nothing but beauty, wealth, pleasure,<br />

        In its whimsical vagabond way,<br />
        Since its for your least whim<br />
        The oceans they swim<br />
        From the ends of the night and the day.<br />
        The sun, going down,<br />
        With its glory will crown<br />
        Canals, fields, and cities entire,<br />
        While the whole earth is rolled<br />
        In the jacinth and gold<br />
        Of its warming and radiant fire.</p>
<p>        There'll be nothing but beauty, wealth, pleasure,<br />

<p>        How can we choke the old and long Remorse<br />
          Which lives, and squirms, and fights<br />
        And feeds on us as worms upon a corse,<br />
          Or, on the oak, its mites?<br />
        How can we choke the old and long Remorse?</p>
<p>        What subtle philtre, wine, or drowsy draught<br />
          Will drown that ancient foe,<br />
        Greedy as whores in his disastrous craft,<br />
          Ant-patient, sure, and slow?<br />
        What subtle philtre, wine or drowsy draught?</p>
<p>        Lovely enchantress, if you know it, say<br />
          To this soul whelmed with woes,<br />
        Dying, whom loads of wounded crush to clay<br />
          Under the horses' shoes:<br />
        Lovely enchantress, if you know it, say</p>
<p>        To this poor moribund, while wolves yet stalk him<br />
          And ravens croak his doom,<br />
        To this spent soldier say if fate will baulk him<br />
          Even of a cross or tomb--<br />
        Say to this moribund, while wolves yet stalk him!</p>
<p>        Can this black muddy sky be ever lighted,<br />
          The shades be ever torn,<br />
        Denser than pitch, to day and dusk benighted,<br />
          To lightning, stars, or morn?<br />
        Can this black muddy sky be ever lighted?</p>
<p>        The candle Hope that shows the Inn to strangers<br />
          Is blown out, snuffed, and melted.<br />
        Lacking both moon and glimmer, how shall rangers<br />
          Of evil roads be sheltered?<br />
        The devil snuffed the light that burned for strangers.</p>
<p>        Sweet witch, do you love spirits lost to grace?<br />
          Whose sins are not remitted?<br />
        Say, do you know Remorse, with venomed face,<br />
          By whom our hearts are spitted?<br />
        Sweet witch, do you love spirits lost to grace?</p>
<p>        The Irreparable gnaws us where it lurks<br />
          And for our soul's defacement,<br />
        As on a monument the termite, works<br />
          Up from the very basement.<br />
        The Irreparable gnaws us where it lurks.</p>
<p>        In tawdry theatres I've sometimes seen<br />
          How, to the blare of brasses,<br />
        Miraculous, to light some hellish scene,<br />
          Like dawn, a fairy passes;<br />
        In tawdry theatres I've often seen</p>
<p>        That by this fay of light, and gold, and gauzes,<br />
          Some monstrous fiend is slain.<br />
        But my heart knows no raptures or applauses--<br />
          A fleapit where, in vain,<br />
        One waits, and waits the creature winged with gauzes.</p>

<p>        You're like an autumn sky, rose, clear, and placid.<br />
        But sorrow whelms me, like the tide's assault,<br />
        And ebbing, leaves upon my lips the acid<br />
        And muddy-bitter memory of its salt.</p>
<p>        Your hand may stroke my breast, but not console.<br />
        What it seeks there is but a hole, deep caverned<br />
        By women's claws and fangs, and ransacked whole.<br />
        Seek not my heart, on which the beasts have ravened.</p>
<p>        My heart's a palace plundered by the rabble:<br />
        They tope, they kill, in blood and guts they scrabble:--<br />
        --A perfume swims around your naked breast!</p>
<p>        O Beauty, flail of spirits, you know best!<br />
        With your eyes' fire, lit up as for a spree,<br />
        Char the poor rags those beasts have left of me!</p>

<p>        Soon into frozen shades, like leaves, we'll tumble.<br />
        Adieu, short summer's blaze, that shone to mock.<br />
        I hear already the funereal rumble<br />
        Of logs, as on the paving-stones they shock.</p>
<p>        Winter will enter in my soul to dwell--<br />
        Rage, hate, fear, horror, labour forced and dire!<br />
        My heart will seem, to sun that polar hell,<br />
        A dim, red, frozen block, devoid of fire.</p>
<p>        Shuddering I hear the heavy thud of fuel.<br />
        The building of a gallows sounds as good!<br />
        My spirit, like a tower, reels to the cruel<br />
        Battering-ram in every crash of wood.</p>
<p>        The ceaseless echoes rock me and appal.<br />
        They're nailing up a coffin, I'll be bound,<br />
        For whom?--Last night was Summer. Here's the Fall.<br />
        There booms a farewell volley in the sound.</p>
<p>                                   II</p>
<p>        I like the greenish light in your long eyes,<br />
        Dear: but today all things are sour to me.<br />
        And naught, your hearth, your boudoir, nor your sighs<br />
        Are worth the sun that glitters on the sea.</p>
<p>        Yet love me, tender heart, as mothers cherish<br />
        A thankless wretch. Lover or sister, be<br />
        Ephemeral sweetness of the suns that perish<br />
        Or glory of the autumn swift to flee.</p>
<p>        Brief task! The charnel yawns in hunger horrid,<br />
        Yet let me with my head upon your knees,<br />
        Although I mourn the summer, white and torrid<br />
        Taste these last yellow rays before they freeze.</p>

<p>                       (Ex Voto in Spanish Style)</p>
<p>        I'd build, Madonna, love, for my belief,<br />
        An altar in the dim crypt of my grief,<br />
        And in the darkest corner of my heart,<br />
        From mortal lust and mockery far apart,<br />
        Scoop you a niche, with gold and azure glaze,<br />
        Where you would stand in wonderment and gaze,<br />
        With my pure verses trellised, and all round<br />
        In constellated rhymes of crystal bound:<br />
        And with a huge tiara richly crowned.<br />
        Out of the Jealousy which rules my passion,<br />
        Mortal Madonna, I a cloak would fashion,<br />
        Barbarous, stiff, and heavy with my doubt,<br />
        Whereon as in a fourm you would fill out<br />
        And mould your lair. Of tears, not pearls, would be<br />
        The sparkle of its rich embroidery:<br />
        Your robe would be my lust, with waving flow,<br />
        Poising on tips, in valleys lying low,<br />
        And clothing, in one kiss, coral and snow.<br />
        In my Respect (for satin) you'ld be shod<br />
        Which your white feet would humble to the clod,<br />
        While prisoning their flesh with tender hold<br />
        It kept their shape imprinted like a mould.<br />
        If for a footstool to support your shoon,<br />
        For all my art, I could not get the moon,<br />
        I'd throw the serpent, that devours my vitals<br />
        Under your trampling heels for his requitals,<br />
        Victorious queen, to spurn, bruise, and belittle<br />
        That monstrous worm blown-up with hate and spittle.<br />
        Round you my thoughts like candles should be seen<br />
        Around the flowered shrine of the virgins' Queen,<br />
        Reflected on a roof that's painted blue,<br />
        And aiming all their golden eyes at you.<br />
        Since nought is in me that you do not stir,<br />
        All will be incense, benjamin, and myrrh,<br />
        And up to you, white peak, in clouds will soar<br />
        My stormy soul, in rapture, to adore.</p>
<p>        In fine, your role of Mary to perfect<br />
        And mingle barbarism with respect--<br />
        Of seven deadly sins, O black delight!<br />
        Remorseful torturer, to show my sleight,<br />
        I'll forge and sharpen seven deadly swords<br />
        And like a callous juggler on the boards,<br />
        Taking it for my target, I would dart<br />
        Them deep into your streaming, sobbing heart.</p>

<p>                          _Song of Afternoon_</p>
<p>        Though your eyebrows' wicked slant<br />
        Give you an intriguing air<br />
        Which the angels do not share<br />
        Sorceress, whose eyes enchant--</p>
<p>        My passion, terrible yet gay,<br />
        With all my heart I bow before you,<br />
        With that devotion to adore you<br />
        That priests to sacred idols pay.</p>
<p>        Deserts and woods embalmed your hair,<br />
        Its movements give your head the stigma<br />
        Of sphinx-like secret and enigma,<br />
        Both in its attitude and air.</p>
<p>        As round a censer vapours form,<br />
        About your flesh the perfumes wander.<br />
        The selfsame charms you seem to squander<br />
        As does an evening, dark yet warm,</p>
<p>        The strongest philtres cannot craze<br />
        As does your indolent address<br />
        And you have mastered a caress<br />
        Dead corpses from their tombs to raise.</p>
<p>        Your hips are amorous of your breast<br />
        And of your back: your languorous pose<br />
        Enchants the cushions where you doze<br />
        When in their depths you make your nest.</p>
<p>        Sometimes in order to appease<br />
        Mysterious rages in your soul,<br />
        You bite and kiss without control.<br />
        Then with a mocking laugh you tease</p>
<p>        My heart, brown beauty, tearing it:<br />
        Then over it the light is strewn<br />
        Of your eye, softer than the moon,<br />
        Till with its glance my soul is lit.</p>
<p>        Underneath your satin shoes,<br />
        And underneath your silken feet,<br />
        My joy, my fate, my genius meet<br />
        To strew the pathway of my muse.</p>
<p>        My soul is healed, restored and made complete<br />
        By you, all colour, warmth, and light,<br />
        in my Siberia a bright<br />
        Explosion as of tropic heat.</p>

<p>        Picture Diana, gallantly arrayed,<br />
        Ranging the woods, elated with the chase,<br />
        With flying hair and naked breasts displayed,<br />
        Defying fleetest horsemen with her pace.</p>
<p>        Know you Theroigne whom blood and fire exalt,<br />
        Hounding a shoeless rabble to the fray,<br />
        Up royal stairways heading the assault,<br />
        And mounting, sword in hand, to show the way?</p>
<p>        Such is Sisina. Terrible her arms.<br />
        But charity restrains her killing charms.<br />
        Though rolling drums and scent of powder madden</p>
<p>        Her courage,--laying by its pikes and spears,<br />
        For those who merit, her scorched heart will sadden,<br />
        And open, in its depth, a well of tears.</p>

        From solitude, the pure heart's Spring.</p>
<p>        Your brows should be with garlands twined,<br />

        Courses, when the pilots falter--<br />

<p>        Cistern full of virtuous ruth,<br />
        Fountain of eternal youth,<br />
        Give to dumbness speech and truth!</p>
<p>        What was dirty, you cremated,<br />
        What uneven--you equated,<br />
        What was weak you re-created.</p>
<p>        Inn, on the hungry roads I tramp,<br />
        And, in the dark, a guiding lamp<br />
        To steer the lost one back to camp.</p>
<p>        To my strength add strength, O sweet<br />
        Bath, where scents and unguents meet!<br />
        Anoint me for some peerless feat!</p>
<p>        Holy water most seraphic,<br />
        On the lusts in which I traffic<br />
        Flash your chastity ecstatic.</p>
<p>        Bowl of gems where radiance dances.<br />
        Salt that the holy bread enhances,<br />
        And sacred wine--your name is Frances!</p>

<p>        In scented countries by the sun caressed<br />
        I've known, beneath a tent of purple boughs,<br />
        And palmtrees shedding slumber as they drowse,<br />
        A creole lady with a charm unguessed.</p>
<p>        She's pale, and warm, and duskily beguiling;<br />
        Nobility is moulded in her neck;<br />
        Slender and tall she holds herself in check,<br />
        An huntress born, sure-eyed, and quiet-smiling.</p>
<p>        Should you go, Madam, to the land of glory<br />
        Along the Seine or Loire, where you would merit<br />
        To ornament some mansion famed in story,</p>
<p>        Your eyes would burn in those deep-shaded parts,<br />
        And breed a thousand rhymes in poets' hearts,<br />
        Tamed like the negro slaves that you inherit.</p>

<p>        Agatha, does your heart rise up and fly,<br />
        Far from the city's black and sordid sea<br />
        Towards a sea that's blue as any sky,<br />
        And clear and deep as pure virginity?<br />
        Agatha, does your heart rise up and fly?</p>
<p>        The sea, the mighty sea, consoles our labour.<br />
        What demon taught the sea with raucous verse<br />
        To choir the organ which the winds belabour<br />
        And lullaby our sorrows like a nurse?<br />
        The sea, the mighty sea, consoles our labour.</p>
<p>        Train, bear me; take me, ship, to other climes!<br />
        Far, far! For here the mud is made of tears.<br />
        --Does Agatha's sad heart not say, at times,<br />
        "Far from remorses, sorrows, crimes, and fears,<br />
        Train, bear me; take me, ship, to other climes"?</p>
<p>        How distant is that perfumed paradise!<br />
        Where all is joy and love with azure crowned,<br />
        Where all one loves is truly worth the price,<br />
        And hearts in pure voluptuousness are drowned.<br />
        How distant is that perfumed paradise!</p>
<p>        But the green paradise of childish love,<br />
        Of races, songs, and kisses, and bouquets,<br />
        Of fiddles shrilling in the hills above,<br />
        And jars of wine, and woods, and dying rays--<br />
        But the green paradise of childish love,</p>
<p>        Innocent paradise of furtive joys,<br />
        Is it far off as India or Hong Kong?<br />
        Could it be conjured by a plaintive voice<br />
        Or animated by a silver song--<br />
        That far off paradise of furtive joys?</p>

<p>        And I will bring you, brown delight,<br />
        Kisses as cold as lunar night<br />
        And the caresses of a snake<br />
        Revolving in a grave. At break</p>
<p>        Of morning in its livid hue,<br />
        You'd find I had bequeathed to you<br />
        An empty place as cold as stone.</p>
<p>        Others by tenderness and ruth<br />
        Would reign over your life and youth,<br />

<p>                            _Autumn Sonnet_</p>
<p>        Your eyes like crystal ask me, clear and mute,<br />
        "In me, strange lover, what do you admire?"<br />
        Be lovely: hush: my heart, whom all things tire<br />
        Except the candour of the primal brute,</p>
<p>        Would hide from you the secret burning it<br />
        And its black legend written out in fire,<br />
        O soother of the sleep that I respire!<br />
        Passion I hate, and I am hurt by wit.</p>
<p>        Let us love gently. In his lair laid low,<br />
        Ambushed in shades, Love strings his fatal bow.<br />
        I know his ancient arsenal complete,</p>
<p>        Crime, horror, lunacy--O my pale daisy!<br />
        Are we not suns in Autumn, silver-hazy,<br />
        O my so white, so snow-cold Marguerite?</p>

<p>                          _Sorrow of the Moon_</p>
<p>        More drowsy dreams the moon tonight. She rests<br />
        Like a proud beauty on heaped cushions pressing,<br />
        With light and absent-minded touch caressing,<br />
        Before she sleeps, the contour of her breasts.</p>
<p>        On satin-shimmering, downy avalanches<br />
        She dies from swoon to swoon in languid change,<br />
        And lets her eyes on snowy visions range<br />
        That in the azure rise like flowering branches.</p>
<p>        When sometimes to this earth her languor calm<br />
        Lets streak a stealthy tear, a pious poet,<br />
        The enemy of sleep, in his cupped palm,</p>
<p>        Takes this pale tear, of liquid opal spun<br />
        With rainbow lights, deep in his heart to stow it<br />
        Far from the staring eyeballs of the Sun.</p>

<p>                                 _Cats_</p>
<p>        Sages austere and fervent lovers both,<br />
        In their ripe season, cherish cats, the pride<br />
        Of hearths, strong, mild, and to themselves allied<br />
        In chilly stealth and sedentary sloth.</p>
<p>        Friends both to lust and learning, they frequent<br />
        Silence, and love the horror darkness breeds.<br />
        Erebus would have chosen them for steeds<br />
        To hearses, could their pride to it have bent.</p>
<p>        Dreaming, the noble postures they assume<br />
        Of sphinxes stretching out into the gloom<br />
        That seems to swoon into an endless trance.</p>
<p>        Their fertile flanks are full of sparks that tingle,<br />
        And particles of gold, like grains of shingle,<br />
        Vaguely be-star their pupils as they glance.</p>

<p>        Within the shelter of black yews<br />
        The owls in ranks are ranged apart<br />
        Like foreign gods, whose eyeballs dart<br />
        Red fire. They meditate and muse.</p>
<p>        Without a stir they will remain<br />
        Till, in its melancholy hour,<br />
        Thrusting the level sun from power,<br />
        The shade establishes its reign.</p>
<p>        Their attitude instructs the sage,<br />
        Content with what is near at hand,<br />
        To shun all motion, strife, and rage.</p>
<p>        Men, crazed with shadows that they chase,<br />
        Bear, as a punishment, the brand<br />
        Of having wished to change their place.</p>

<p>        I am an author's pipe. To see me<br />
        And my outlandish shape to heed,<br />
        You'd know my master was a dreamy<br />
        Inveterate smoker of the weed.</p>
<p>        When he is loaded down with care,<br />
        I like a stove will smoke and burn<br />
        Wherein the supper they prepare<br />
        Against the labourer's return.</p>
<p>        I nurse his spirit with my charm<br />
        Swaying it in a soft, uncertain,<br />
        And vaguely-moving azure curtain.</p>
<p>        I roll a potent cloud of balm<br />
        To lull his spirit into rest<br />
        And cure the sorrows in his breast.</p>

<p>                                _Music_</p>
<p>        Music uplifts me like the sea and races<br />
          Me to my distant star,<br />
        Through veils of mist or through ethereal spaces,<br />
          I sail on it afar.</p>
<p>        With chest flung out and lungs like sails inflated<br />
          Into the depth of night<br />
        I escalade the backs of waves serrated,<br />
          That darkness veils from sight.</p>
<p>        I feel vibrating in me the emotions<br />
          That storm-tossed ships must feel.<br />
        The fair winds and the tempests and the oceans</p>
<p>          Sway my exultant keel.<br />
        Sometimes a vast, dead calm with glassy stare<br />
          Mirrors my dumb despair.</p>

        Buries behind some garbage-heap<br />
        The vaunted body of your youth:</p>
<p>        There, when the chaster stars have set<br />
        And the moon her hammock slung<br />
        Will the spider weave his net<br />
        And the adder hatch her young.</p>
<p>        Your cursÃ¨d head beneath the ground<br />

        The dismal cries of wolves resound,</p>
<p>        Old half-starved witches raising spooks,<br />
        The antics of obscene old men,<br />

<p>        A monstrous spectre carries on his forehead,<br />
        And at a rakish tilt, grotesquely horrid,<br />
        A crown such as at carnivals parade.<br />
        Without a whip or spur he rides a jade,<br />
        A phantom-like apocalyptic moke,<br />
        Whose nostrils seem with rabid froth to smoke.<br />
        Across unbounded space the couple moves<br />
        Spurning infinity with reckless hooves.<br />
        The horseman waves a sword that lights the gloom<br />
        Of nameless crowds he tramples to their doom,<br />
        And, like a prince his mansion, goes inspecting<br />
        The graveyard, which, no skyline intersecting,<br />
        Contains, beneath a sun that's white and bleak,<br />
        Peoples of history, modern and antique.</p>

<p>        In a fat, greasy soil, that's full of snails,<br />
        I'll dig a grave deep down, where I may sleep<br />
        Spreading my bones at ease, to drowse in deep<br />
        Oblivion, as a shark within the wave.</p>
<p>        I hate all tombs, and testaments, and wills:<br />
        I want no human tears; I'd like it more,<br />
        That ravens could attack me with their bills,<br />
        To broach my carcase of its living gore.</p>
<p>        O worms! black friends, who cannot hear or see,<br />
        A free and joyous corpse behold in me!<br />
        You philosophic souls, corruption-bred,</p>
<p>        Plough through my ruins! eat your merry way!<br />
        And if there are yet further torments, say,<br />
        For this old soulless corpse among the dead.</p>

<p>                           _The Cask of Hate_</p>
<p>        The Cask of the pale DanaÃ¯ds is Hate.<br />
        Vainly Revenge, with red strong arms employed,<br />
        Precipitates her buckets, in a spate<br />
        Of blood and tears, to feed the empty void.</p>
<p>        The Fiend bores secret holes to these abysms<br />
        By which a thousand years of sweat and strain<br />
        Escape, though she'd revive their organisms<br />
        In order just to bleed them once again.</p>
<p>        Hate is a drunkard in a tavern staying,<br />
        Who feels his thirst born of its very cure,<br />
        Like Lema's hydra, multiplied by slaying.</p>
<p>        Gay drinkers of their conqueror are sure,<br />
        And Hate is doomed to a sad fate, unable<br />
        Ever to fall and snore beneath the table.</p>

<p>        It's sweet and bitter, of a winter night,<br />
        To hear, beside the crackling, smoking log,<br />
        Far memories prepare themselves for flight<br />
        To carillons that sound amid the fog.</p>
<p>        Happy's the bell whose vigorous throat on high,<br />
        In spite of time, is sound and still unspent,<br />
        To hurl his faithful and religious cry<br />
        Like an old soldier watching in his tent.</p>
<p>        My soul is cracked, and when amidst its care<br />
        It tries with song to fill the frosty air,<br />
        Sometimes, its voice seems like the feeble croak</p>
<p>        A wounded soldier makes, lost in the smoke,<br />
        Beneath a pile of dead, in bloody mire,<br />
        Trying, with fearful efforts, to expire.</p>

        Out of her urn, a dark chill, like a penance,<br />
        Over the graveyards and their wan, grey tenants<br />
        And folk in foggy suburbs out of doors.</p>
<p>        My cat seeks out a litter on the ground<br />
        Twitching her scrawny body flecked with mange.<br />
        The soul of some old poet seems to range<br />
        The gutter, with a chill phantasmal sound.</p>
<p>        The big bell tolls: damp hearth-logs seem to mock,<br />
        Whistling, the sniffle-snuffle of the clock,<br />
        While in the play of odours stale with must,</p>
<p>        Reminders of a dropsical old crone,<br />
        The knave of hearts and queen of spades alone<br />
        Darkly discuss a passion turned to dust.</p>

<p>                                _Spleen_</p>
<p>        I have more memories than had I seen<br />
        Ten centuries. A huge chest that has been<br />
        Stuffed full of writs, bills, verses, balance-sheets<br />
        With golden curls wrapt up in old receipts<br />
        And love-letters--hides less than my sad brain,<br />
        A pyramid, a vault that must contain<br />
        More corpses than the public charnel stores.</p>
<p>        I am a cemetery the moon abhors,<br />
        Where, like remorses, the long worms that trail<br />
        Always the dearest of my dead assail.<br />
        I am a boudoir full of faded roses<br />
        Where many an old outmoded dress reposes<br />
        And faded pastels and pale Bouchers only<br />
        Breathe a scent-flask, long-opened and left lonely . . .</p>
<p>        Nothing can match those limping days for length<br />
        Where under snows of years, grown vast in strength,<br />
        Boredom (of listlessness the pale abortion)<br />
        Of immortality takes the proportion!<br />
        --From henceforth, living matter, you are nought<br />
        But stone surrounded by a dreadful thought:<br />
        Lost in some dim Sahara, an old Sphinx,<br />
        Of whom the world we live in never thinks.<br />
        Lost on the map, it is its surly way<br />
        Only to sing in sunset's fading ray.</p>

<p>                                _Spleen_</p>
<p>        I'm like the King of some damp, rainy clime,<br />
        Grown impotent and old before my time,<br />
        Who scorns the bows and scrapings of his teachers<br />
        And bores himself with hounds and all such creatures.<br />
        Naught can amuse him, falcon, steed, or chase:<br />
        No, not the mortal plight of his whole race<br />
        Dying before his balcony. The tune,<br />
        Sung to this tyrant by his pet buffoon,<br />
        Irks him. His couch seems far more like a grave.<br />
        Even the girls, for whom all kings seem brave,<br />
        Can think no toilet up, nor shameless rig,<br />
        To draw a smirk from this funereal prig.<br />
        The sage who makes him gold, could never find<br />
        The baser element that rots his mind.<br />
        Even those blood-baths the old Romans knew<br />
        And later thugs have imitated too,<br />
        Can't warm this skeleton to deeds of slaughter,<br />
        Whose only blood is Lethe's cold, green water.</p>

<p>        When the cold heavy sky weighs like a lid<br />
        On spirits whom eternal boredom grips,<br />
        And the wide ring of the horizon's hid<br />
        In daytime darker than the night's eclipse:</p>
<p>        When the world seems a dungeon, damp and small,<br />
        Where hope flies like a bat, in circles reeling,<br />
        Beating his timid wings against the wall<br />
        And dashing out his brains against the ceiling:</p>
<p>        When trawling rains have made their steel-grey fibres<br />
        Look like the grilles of some tremendous jail,<br />
        And a whole nation of disgusting spiders<br />
        Over our brains their dusty cobwebs trail:</p>
<p>        Suddenly bells are fiercely clanged about<br />
        And hurl a fearsome howl into the sky<br />
        Like spirits from their country hunted out<br />
        Who've nothing else to do but shriek and cry--</p>
<p>        Then long processions without fifes or drums<br />
        Wind slowly through my soul. Hope, weeping, bows<br />
        To conquest. And atrocious Anguish comes<br />
        To plant his black flag on my drooping brows.</p>

<p>        You forests, like cathedrals, are my dread:<br />
        You roar like organs. Our curst hearts, like cells<br />
        Where death forever rattles on the bed,<br />
        Echo your _de Profundis_ as it swells.</p>
<p>        My spirit hates you, Ocean! sees, and loathes<br />
        Its tumults in your own. Of men defeated<br />
        The bitter laugh, that's full of sobs and oaths,<br />
        Is in your own tremendously repeated.</p>
<p>        How you would please me, Night! without your stars<br />
        Which speak a foreign dialect, that jars<br />
        On one who seeks the void, the black, the bare.</p>
<p>        Yet even your darkest shade a canvas forms<br />
        Whereon my eye must multiply in swarms<br />
        Familiar looks of shapes no longer there.</p>

<p>        My soul, you used to love the battle's rumble.<br />
        Hope, whose sharp spur once kindled you like flame,<br />
        Will mount on you no more. Rest, without shame,<br />
        Old charger, since at every step you stumble.</p>
<p>        Sleep now the sleep of brutes, proud heart: be humble.</p>
<p>        O broken raider, for your outworn mettle,<br />
        Love has no joys, no fight is worth disputing.<br />
        Farewell to all the trumpeting and fluting!<br />
        Pleasure, have done, when brooding shadows settle,</p>
<p>        The blooms of spring are vanquished by the nettle.</p>
<p>        As snows devour stiff corpses in their welter,<br />
        Time wolfs my soul in, minute after minute.<br />
        I've seen the world and everything that's in it,<br />
        And I no longer seek in it for shelter;</p>
<p>        Come, Avalanche! and sweep me helter-skelter.</p>

        Cries to the other, "Life and Morning".</p>
<p>        The unknown Hermes who assists<br />
        The role of Midas to reverse,<br />
        And makes me by a subtle curse<br />
        The saddest of all alchemists--</p>
<p>        By him, my paradise to hell,<br />
        And gold to slag, is changed too well.<br />
        The clouds are winding-sheets, and I,</p>
<p>        Bidding some dear-loved corpse farewell,<br />
        Along the shore-line of the sky,<br />
        Erect my vast sarcophagi.</p>

<p>        --Insatiable yet for all<br />
        That turns on darkness, doom, or dice.<br />
        I'll not, like Ovid, mourn my fall,<br />
        Chased from the Latin paradise.</p>
<p>        Skies, torn like seacoasts by the storm!<br />
        In you I see my pride take form,<br />
        And the huge clouds that rush in streams</p>
<p>        Are the black hearses of my dreams,<br />
        And your red rays reflect the hell,<br />
        In which my heart is pleased to dwell.</p>

<p>        I'll strike you, but without the least<br />
        Anger--as butchers poll an ox,<br />
        Or Moses, when he struck the rocks--<br />
        That from your eyelid thus released,</p>
<p>        The lymph of suffering may brim<br />
        To slake my desert of its drought.<br />
        So my desire, by hope made stout,<br />
        Upon your salty tears may swim,</p>
<p>        Like a proud ship, far out from shore.<br />
        Within my heart, which they'll confound<br />
        With drunken joy, your sobs will sound<br />
        Like drums that beat a charge in war.</p>
<p>        Am I not a faulty chord<br />
        In all this symphony divine.<br />
        Thanks to the irony malign<br />
        That shakes and cuts me like a sword?</p>
<p>        It's in my voice, the raucous jade!<br />
        It's in my blood's black venom too!<br />
        I am the looking-glass, wherethrough<br />
        Megera sees herself portrayed!</p>
<p>        I am the wound, and yet the blade!<br />
        The smack, and yet the cheek that takes it!<br />
        The limb, and yet the wheel that breaks it,<br />
        The torturer, and he who's flayed!</p>
<p>        One of the sort whom all revile,<br />
        A Vampire, my own blood I quaff,<br />
        Condemned to an eternal laugh<br />

<p>        A Form, Idea, or Essence, chased<br />
        Out of the azure sky, and shot<br />
        Into a leaden Styx where not<br />
        A star can pierce the muddy waste:</p>
<p>        An angel, rash explorer, who,<br />
        Tempted by love of strange deformity,<br />
        Caught in a nightmare of enormity,<br />
        Fights like a swimmer, wrestling through</p>
<p>        A monstrous whorl of eddying spume,<br />
        In deathly anguish, from him flinging<br />
        The wave that, like an idiot singing,<br />
        Goes pirouetting through the gloom:</p>
<p>        A wretch enchanted, who, to flee<br />
        A den of serpents, gropes about<br />
        In desperation vain, without<br />
        Discovering a match or key:</p>
<p>        A damnÃ¨d soul, who, with no lamp,<br />
        Stands by a gulf, whose humid scent<br />
        Betrays the depth of the descent<br />
        Of endless stairs without a ramp,</p>
<p>        Where slimy monsters watch the track<br />
        Whose eyeballs phosphoresce and glow<br />
        Only to make the night more black<br />
        And nought except themselves to show:</p>
<p>        A vessel that the pole betrays,<br />
        Caught in a crystal trap all round,<br />
        And seeking by what fatal sound<br />
        It ever entered such a maze:--</p>
<p>        Clear emblems! measuring the level<br />

        Mirror, its own confession hears!<br />
        Deep well where Truth is trembling shown<br />
        And like a livid star appears,</p>
<p>        Ironic beacon and infernal<br />
        Torch of satanic grace, but still<br />
        Sole glory and relief eternal,<br />

        "_Remember!_ Soon the vibrant woes will quiver,<br />
        Like arrows in a target, in your heart.</p>
<p>        To the horizon Pleasure will take flight<br />
        As flits a vaporous sylphide to the wings.<br />
        Each instant gnaws a crumb of the delight<br />
        That for his season every mortal brings.</p>
<p>        Three thousand times and more, each hour, the second<br />

        I've pumped your lifeblood with my loathsome bill.'</p>

<p>        _Remember._ Time the gamester (it's the law)<br />
        Wins always, without cheating. Daylight wanes.<br />
        Night deepens. The abyss with gulfy maw<br />
        Thirsts on unsated, while the hour-glass drains.</p>
<p>        Sooner or later, now, the time must be<br />
        When Hazard, Virtue (your still-virgin mate),<br />
        Repentance, (your last refuge), or all three--<br />

<p>        More chasteness to my eclogues it would give,<br />
        Sky-high, like old astrologers to live,<br />
        A neighbour of the belfries: and to hear<br />
        Their solemn hymns along the winds career.<br />
        High in my attic, chin in hand, I'd swing<br />
        And watch the workshops as they roar and sing.<br />
        The city's masts--each steeple, tower, and flue--<br />
        And skies that bring eternity to view.</p>
<p>        Sweet, through the mist, to see illumed again<br />
        Stars through the azure, lamps behind the pane,<br />
        Rivers of carbon irrigate the sky,<br />
        And the pale moon pour magic from on high.<br />
        I'd watch three seasons passing by, and then<br />
        When winter came with dreary snows, I'd pen<br />
        Myself between closed shutters, bolts, and doors,<br />
        And build my fairy palaces indoors.</p>
<p>        A dream of blue horizons I would garble<br />
        With thoughts of fountains weeping on to marble,<br />
        Of gardens, kisses, birds that ceaseless sing,<br />
        And all the Idyll holds of childhood's spring.<br />
        The riots, brawling past my window-pane,<br />
        From off my desk would not divert my brain.<br />
        Because I would be plunged in pleasure still.<br />
        Conjuring up the Springtime with my will,<br />
        And forcing sunshine from my heart to form,<br />
        Of burning thoughts, an atmosphere that's warm.</p>

        On town, and field, and roof, and dusty street--<br />

<p>        In place of stockings holed<br />
        A dagger made of gold,<br />
        To light the lecher's eye,<br />
            Flash on your thigh:</p>
<p>        Let ribbons slip their bows<br />
        And for our sins disclose<br />
        A breast whose radiance vies<br />
            Even with your eyes.</p>
<p>        To show them further charms<br />
        Let them implore your arms,<br />
        And these, rebuking, humble<br />
            Fingers that fumble</p>
<p>        With preferred pearls aglow<br />
        And sonnets of Belleau,<br />
        Which, fettered by your beauty,<br />
            They yield in duty.</p>
<p>        Riffraff of scullion-rhymers<br />

<p>        Each page-boy lucky-starred,<br />
        Each marquis, each Ronsard<br />
        Would hang about your bower<br />
            To while an hour.</p>
<p>        You'd count, among your blisses,<br />

<p>                               _The Swan_</p>
<p>                             TO VICTOR HUGO</p>
<p>                                   I.</p>
<p>        Andromache!--This shallow stream, the brief<br />
        Mirror you once so grandly overcharged<br />
        With your vast majesty of widowed grief,<br />
        This lying SimoÃ¯s your tears enlarged.</p>
<p>        Evoked your name, and made me think of you.<br />
        As I was crossing the new Carrousel.<br />
        --Old Paris is no more (cities renew,<br />
        Quicker than human hearts, their changing spell).</p>
<p>        In mind I see that camp of huts, the muddle<br />
        Of rough-hewn roofs and leaning shafts for miles.<br />
        The grass, green logs stagnating in the puddle.<br />
        Where bric-a-brac lay glittering in piles.</p>
<p>        Once a menagerie parked there. And there<br />
        It chanced one morning, when from slumber freed,<br />
        Labour stands up, and Transport through still air<br />
        Rumbles its sombre hurricane of speed.--</p>
<p>        A swan escaped its cage: and as its feet<br />
        With finny palms on the harsh pavement scraped,<br />
        Trailing white plumage on the stony street,<br />
        In the dry gutter for fresh water gaped.</p>
<p>        Nervously bathing in the dust, in wonder<br />
        It asked, remembering its native stream,<br />
        "When will the rain come down? When roll the thunder?"<br />
        I see it now, strange myth and fatal theme!</p>
<p>        Sometimes, like Ovid's wretch, towards the sky<br />
        (Ironically blue with cruel smile)<br />
        Its neck, convulsive, reared its head on high<br />
        As though it were its Maker to revile.</p>
<p>                                   II</p>
<p>        Paris has changed, but in my grief no change.<br />
        New palaces and scaffoldings and blocks,<br />
        To me, are allegories, nothing strange.<br />
        My memories are heavier than rocks.</p>
<p>        Passing the Louvre, one image makes me sad:<br />
        That swan, like other exiles that we knew,<br />
        Grandly absurd, with gestures of the mad,<br />
        Gnawed by one craving!--Then I think of you,</p>
<p>        Who fell from your great husband's arms, to be<br />
        A beast of freight for Pyrrhus, and for life,<br />
        Bowed by an empty tomb in ecstacy--<br />
        Great Hector's widow! Helenus's wife!</p>
<p>        I think, too, of the starved and phthisic negress<br />
        Tramping the mud, who seeks, with haggard eye,<br />
        The palms of Africa, and for some egress<br />
        Out of this great black wall of foggy sky:</p>
<p>        Of those who've lost what they cannot recover:<br />
        Of those who slake with tears their lonely hours<br />
        And milk the she-wolf, Sorrow, for their mother:<br />
        And skinny orphans withering like flowers.</p>
<p>        So in the forest of my soul's exile,<br />
        Remembrance winds his horn as on he rides.<br />
        I think of sailors stranded on an isle,<br />
        Captives, and slaves--and many more besides.</p>

<p>                          _The Seven Old Men_</p>
<p>                             TO VICTOR HUGO</p>
<p>        Ant-seething city, city full of dreams,<br />
        Where ghosts by daylight tug the passer's sleeve.<br />
        Mystery, like sap, through all its conduit-streams,<br />
        Quickens the dread Colossus that they weave.</p>
<p>        One early morning, in the street's sad mud,<br />
        Whose houses, by the fog increased in height,<br />
        Seemed wharves along a riverside in flood:<br />
        When with a scene to match the actor's plight,</p>
<p>        Foul yellow mist had filled the whole of space:<br />
        Steeling my nerves to play a hero's part,<br />
        I coaxed my weary soul with me to pace<br />
        The backstreets shaken by each lumbering cart.</p>
<p>        A wretch appeared whose tattered, yellow clothing,<br />
        Matching the colour of the raining skies,<br />
        Could make it shower down alms--but for the loathing<br />
        Malevolence that glittered in his eyes.</p>
<p>        The pupils of his eyes, with bile injected,<br />
        Seemed with their glance to make the frost more raw.<br />
        Stiff as a sword, his long red beard projected,<br />
        Like that of Judas, level with his jaw.</p>
<p>        He was not bent, but broken, with the spine<br />
        Forming a sharp right-angle to the straight,<br />
        So that his stick, to finish the design,<br />
        Gave him the stature and the crazy gait</p>
<p>        Of a three-footed Jew, or crippled hound.<br />
        He plunged his soles into the slush as though<br />
        To crush the dead; and to the world around<br />
        Seemed less of an indifferent than a foe.</p>
<p>        His image followed him, (back, stick, and beard<br />
        In nothing differed) spawned from the same hole,<br />
        A centenarian twin. Both spectres steered<br />
        With the same gait to the same unknown goal.</p>
<p>        To what foul plot was I exposed? of what<br />
        Humiliating hazard made the jeer?<br />
        For seven times, (I counted) was begot<br />
        This sinister, self multiplying fear!</p>
<p>        Let him mark well who laughs at my despair<br />
        With no fraternal shudder in reply . . .<br />
        Those seven loathsome monsters had the air,<br />
        Though rotting through, of what can never die.</p>
<p>        Disgusting Phoenix, his own sire and father!<br />
        Could I have watched an eighth instalment spawn<br />
        Ironic, fateful, grim--nor perished rather?<br />
        But from that hellish _cortÃ¨ge_ I'd withdrawn.</p>
<p>        Perplexed as drunkards when their sight is doubled,<br />
        I locked my room, sick, fevered, chilled with fright:<br />
        With all my spirit sorely hurt and troubled<br />
        By so ridiculous yet strange a sight.</p>
<p>        Vainly my reason for the helm was striving:<br />
        The tempest of my efforts made a scorn.<br />
        My soul like a dismasted wreck went driving<br />
        Over a monstrous sea without a bourn.</p>

<p>                         _The Little Old Women_</p>
<p>                             TO VICTOR HUGO</p>
<p>                                   I</p>
<p>        In sinuous folds of cities old and grim,<br />
        Where all things, even horror, turn to grace,<br />
        I follow, in obedience to my whim,<br />
        Strange, feeble, charming creatures round the place.</p>
<p>        These crooked freaks were women in their pride,<br />
        Fair Eponine or LaÃ¯s! Humped and bent,<br />
        Love them! Because they still have souls inside.<br />
        Under their draughty skirts in tatters rent,</p>
<p>        They crawl: a vicious wind their carrion rides;<br />
        From the deep roar of traffic see them cower,<br />
        Pressing like precious relics to their sides<br />
        Some satchel stitched with mottoes or a flower.</p>
<p>        They trot like marionettes along the level,<br />
        Or drag themselves like wounded deer, poor crones!<br />
        Or dance, against their will, as if the devil<br />
        Were swinging in the belfry of their bones.</p>
<p>        Cracked though they are, their eyes are sharp as drills<br />
        And shine, like pools of water in the night,--<br />
        The eyes of little girls whom wonder thrills<br />
        To laugh at all that sparkles and is bright.</p>
<p>        The coffins of old women very often<br />
        Are near as small as those of children are.<br />
        Wise Death, who makes a symbol of a coffin<br />
        Displays a taste both charming and bizarre.</p>
<p>        And when I track some feeble phantom fleeing<br />
        Through Paris's immense ant-swarming Babel,<br />
        I always think that such a fragile being<br />
        Is moving softly to another cradle.</p>
<p>        Unless, sometimes, in geometric mood,<br />
        To see the strange deformities they offer,<br />
        I muse how often he who saws the wood<br />
        Must change the shape and outline of the coffer.</p>
<p>        Those eyes are wells a million teardrops feed,<br />
        Crucibles spangled by a cooling ore,<br />
        Invincible in charm to all that breed<br />
        Austere Misfortune suckled with her lore.</p>
<p>                                   II</p>
<p>        Vestal whom old Frascati could enamour:<br />
        Thalia's nun, whose name was only known<br />
        To her dead prompter: madcap full of glamour<br />
        Whom Tivoli once sheltered as its own--</p>
<p>        They all elate me. But of these a few,<br />
        Of sorrow having made a honeyed leaven,<br />
        Say to Devotion, "Lend me wings anew,<br />
        O powerful Hippogriff, and fly to heaven."</p>
<p>        One for her fatherland a martyr: one<br />
        By her own husband wronged beyond belief:<br />
        And one a pierced Madonna through her son--<br />
        They all could make a river with their grief.</p>
<p>                                  III</p>
<p>        Yes, I have followed them, time and again!<br />
        One, I recall, when sunset, like a heart,<br />
        Bled through the sky from wounds of ruddy stain,<br />
        Pensively sat upon a seat apart,</p>
<p>        To listen to the music, rich in metal,<br />
        That's played by bands of soldiers in the parks<br />
        On golden, soul-reviving eves, to fettle,<br />
        From meek civilian hearts, heroic sparks.</p>
<p>        This one was straight and stiff, in carriage regal,<br />
        She breathed the warrior-music through her teeth,<br />
        Opened her eye like that of an old eagle,<br />
        And bared a forehead moulded for a wreath.</p>
<p>                                   IV</p>
<p>        Thus, then, you journey, uncomplaining, stoic<br />
        Across the strife of modern cities flung,<br />
        Sad mothers, courtesans, or saints heroic,<br />
        Whose names of old were heard on every tongue,</p>
<p>        You once were grace, and you were glory once.<br />
        None know you now. Derisory advances<br />
        Some drunkard makes you, mixed with worse affronts.<br />
        And on your heels a child-tormentor prances.</p>
<p>        But I who watch you tenderly: and measure<br />
        With anxious eye, your weak unsteady gait<br />
        As would a father--get a secret pleasure<br />
        On your account, as on your steps I wait.</p>
<p>        I see your passionate and virgin crazes;<br />
        Sombre or bright, I see your vanished prime;<br />
        My soul, resplendent with your virtue, blazes,<br />
        And revels in your vices and your crimes.</p>
<p>        Poor wrecks! My family! Kindred in mind, you<br />
        Receive from me each day my last addresses.<br />
        Eighty-year Eves, will yet tomorrow find you<br />
        On whom the claw of God so fiercely presses?</p>
<p>                                  XCII</p>
<p>                              _The Blind_</p>
<p>        My soul, survey them, dreadful as they seem.<br />
        Like marionettes, ridiculous they stare.<br />
        Strange as somnambulists that, in their dream,<br />
        Dart shadowy orbs around we know not where.</p>
<p>        Their eyes, from which the heavenly spark has flown,<br />
        Remain uplifted, as in distant quest,<br />
        Skyward: but never on the paving stone<br />
        Do they pore dreamingly or come to rest.</p>
<p>        They traverse thus the illimitable Dark,<br />
        Twin of eternal Silence. While the City<br />
        May sing around us, bellow, laugh, or bark,--</p>
<p>        By pleasure blinded even to horror, I,<br />
        Too, drag my way, but, more a thing of pity,<br />
        Ask what the Blind are seeking there on high.</p>
<p>                                 XCIII</p>
<p>                             _A Passer-by_</p>
<p>        The deafening street roared on. Full, slim, and grand<br />
        In mourning and majestic grief, passed down<br />
        A woman, lifting with a stately hand<br />
        And swaying the black borders of her gown;</p>
<p>        Noble and swift, her leg with statues matching;<br />
        I drank, convulsed, out of her pensive eye,<br />
        A livid sky where hurricanes were hatching,<br />
        Sweetness that charms, and joy that makes one die.</p>
<p>        A lighting-flash--then darkness! Fleeting chance<br />
        Whose look was my rebirth--a single glance!<br />
        Through endless time shall I not meet with you?</p>
<p>        Far off! too late! or never!--I not knowing<br />
        Who you may be, nor you where I am going--<br />
        You, whom I might have loved, who know it too!</p>

<p>                                   I.</p>
<p>        Quaint anatomic plates are sold<br />
        Along the quays in third-hand stalls<br />
        Where tomes cadaverous and old<br />
        Slumber like mummies in their palls.</p>
<p>        In them the craftsman's skill combines<br />
        With expert knowledge in a way<br />
        That beautifies these chill designs<br />
        Although the subject's far from gay.</p>
<p>        One notes that, consummating these<br />
        Mysterious horrors, God knows how,<br />
        Skeletons and anatomies<br />
        Peel off their skins to delve and plough.</p>

<p>        Navvies, funereal and resigned,<br />
        From the tough ground with which you tussle<br />
        With all the effort that can find<br />
        Filleted spine or skinless muscle--</p>
<p>        O grave-snatched convicts, say what strange<br />
        Harvest you hope from such a soil<br />
        And who the farmer is whose grange<br />
        You would replenish with this toil.</p>
<p>        Mean you to show (O evil-starred<br />
        Exponents of too stark a doom)<br />
        The promised sleep may yet be barred,<br />
        Even from us, beyond the tomb;</p>
<p>        That even extinction may turn traitor,<br />
        And Death itself, can be a lie;<br />
        And that perhaps, sooner or later,<br />
        Forever, when we come to die,</p>
<p>        In some strange country, without wages,<br />
        On stubborn outcrops delving holes,<br />
        We'll push a shovel through the ages<br />
        Beneath our flayed and blinding soles?</p>

<p>                           _Evening Twilight_</p>
<p>        Delightful evening, partner of the crook,<br />
        Steals in, wolf-padded, like a complice: look:<br />
        Heaven, like a garret, closes to the day,<br />
        And Man, impatient, turns a beast of prey.</p>
<p>        Sweet evening, loved by those whose arms can tell.<br />
        Without a lie, "Today we've laboured well:"<br />
        Sweet evening, it is she who brings relief<br />
        To men with souls devoured by one fierce grief,<br />
        Obstinate thinkers drowsy in the head,<br />
        And toil-bent workmen groping to their bed.</p>
<p>        But insalubrious demons of the airs,<br />
        Like business people, wake to their affairs<br />
        And, flying, knock, like bats, on walls and shutters.<br />
        Now Prostitution lights up in the gutters<br />
        Across the glimmering jets the wind torments.<br />
        Like a huge ant-hive it unseals its vents.<br />
        On every side it weaves its hidden tracks<br />
        Like enemies preparing night-attacks.<br />
        It squirms within the City's breast of mire,<br />
        A worm that steals the food that men desire.</p>
<p>        One hears the kitchens hissing here and there,<br />
        Operas squealing, orchestras ablare.<br />
        Cheap _tables d'hÃ´te_, where gaming lights the eyes,<br />
        Fill up with whores, and sharpers, their allies:<br />
        And thieves, whose office knows no truce nor rest,<br />
        Will shortly now start working, too, with zest,<br />
        Gently unhinging doors and forcing tills,<br />
        To live some days and buy their sweethearts frills.</p>
<p>        Collect yourself, my soul, in this grave hour<br />
        And shut your ears against the din and stour.<br />
        It is the hour when sick men's pains increase.<br />
        Death grips them by the throat, and soon they cease<br />
        Their destined task, to find the common pit.<br />
        The ward is filled with sighings. Out of it<br />
        Not all return the scented soup to taste,<br />
        Warm at the hearthside, by some loved-one placed.</p>
<p>        But then how few among them can recall<br />
        Joys of the hearth, or ever lived at all!</p>

<p>                             _The Gamblers_</p>
<p>        In faded armchairs, harlots of past years<br />
        Pale, with false eyebrows, wheedling, fatal eyes,<br />
        And weird, affected airs, clink from thin ears<br />
        A feeble sound, where tin with crystal vies.</p>
<p>        Round the green tables, faces without lips,<br />
        Lips without colour, jaws their teeth surviving.<br />
        And fingers which a hellish fever grips<br />
        Convulsively in breasts and pockets diving</p>
<p>        Under the dirty ceiling, lustres flame<br />
        And chandeliers, that blaze without remittance<br />
        On shady brows of poets dear to fame,<br />
        Who come to waste their sorely-sweated pittance.</p>
<p>        Such was the picture, in nocturnal dreaming,<br />
        I saw unfurled to my clairvoyant eye.<br />
        In that grim vault, one form on elbows leaning,<br />
        Unspeaking, cold, and envious--was I!--</p>
<p>        Yes! envying, for their all-tenacious passion,<br />
        These raddled tarts in their funereal glee,<br />
        Who trafficked there, in such a merry fashion,<br />
        Dead virtue and lost beauty on the spree.</p>
<p>        My heart was chilled with fear at envying<br />
        Wretches who, headlong, rush to be destroyed,<br />
        And, drunk with their own blood, seek anything--<br />
        Hell, death, or torture--rather than the Void!</p>

<p>        Proud, as a living person, of her height,<br />
        Her scarf and gloves and huge bouquet of roses,<br />
        She shows such nonchalance and ease as might<br />
        A thin coquette excessive in her poses.</p>
<p>        Who, at a ball, has seen a form so slim?<br />
        Her sumptuous skirts extravagantly shower<br />
        To a dry foot that, exquisitely trim,<br />
        Her footwear pinches, dainty as a flower.</p>
<p>        The frills that rub her collarbone, and feel,<br />
        Like a lascivious rill against a rock,<br />
        The charms she is so anxious to conceal,<br />
        Defend them, too, from ridicule and mock.</p>
<p>        Her eyes are formed of emptiness and shade.<br />
        Her skull, with flowers so deftly decked about,<br />
        Upon her dainty vertebrae is swayed.<br />
        Oh what a charm when nullity tricks out!</p>
<p>        "Caricature", some might opine, but wrongly,<br />
        Whose hearts, too drunk with flesh that runs to waste,<br />
        Ignore the grace of what upholds so strongly.<br />
        Tall skeleton, you match my dearest taste!</p>
<p>        Come you to trouble with your strong grimace,<br />
        The feast of life? Or has some old desire<br />
        Rowelled your living carcase from its place<br />
        And sent you, credulous, to feed its fire?</p>
<p>        With tunes of fiddles and the flames of candles,<br />
        Hope you to chase the nightmare far apart,<br />
        Or with a flood of orgies, feasts, and scandals<br />
        To quench the hell that's lighted in your heart?</p>
<p>        Exhaustless well of follies and of faults,<br />
        Of the old woe the alembic and the urn,<br />
        Around your trellised ribs, in new assaults,<br />
        I see the insatiable serpent turn.</p>
<p>        I fear your coquetry's not worth the strain,<br />
        The prize not worth the effort you prolong.<br />
        Could mortal hearts your railleries explain?<br />
        The joys of horror only charm the strong.</p>
<p>        The pits of your dark eyes dread fancies breathe,<br />
        And vertigo. Among the dancers prudent,<br />
        Hope not your sixteen pairs of smiling teeth<br />
        Will ever find a contemplative student.</p>
<p>        Yet who's not squeezed a skeleton with passion?<br />
        Nor ravened with his kisses on the meat<br />
        Of charnels. What of costume, scent, or fashion?<br />
        The man who feigns disgust, betrays conceit.</p>
<p>        O noseless geisha, unresisted gouge!<br />
        Tell these fastidious feigners, from your husk--<br />
        "Proud fondling fools, in spite of talc and rouge,<br />
        You smell of death. Anatomies of musk,</p>
<p>        Withered AntinoÅ«ses, beaux of dunder,<br />
        Corpses in varnish, Lovelaces of bone,<br />
        The dance of death, with universal thunder,<br />
        Is whirling you to places yet unknown!</p>
<p>        From Seine to Ganges frolicking about,<br />
        You see not, through a black hole in the ceiling.<br />
        Like a great blunderbus, with funnelled snout.<br />
        The Angel's trumpet, on the point of pealing.</p>
<p>        In every clime, Death studies your devices<br />
        And vain contortions, laughable Humanity,<br />
        And oft, like you, perfumes herself with spices<br />
        Mixing her irony with your insanity!"</p>

<p>        Dear indolent, I love to watch you so,<br />
        While on the ceiling break the tunes of dances,<br />
        And hesitant, harmoniously slow,<br />
        You turn the wandering boredom of your glances.</p>
<p>        I watch the gas-flares colouring your drawn,<br />
        Pale forehead, which a morbid charm enhances,<br />
        Where evening lamps illuminate a dawn<br />
        In eyes as of a painting that entrances:</p>
<p>        And then I say, "She's fair and strangely fresh,<br />
        Whom memory crowns with lofty towers above.<br />
        Her heart is like a peach's murdered flesh,<br />
        Or like her own, most ripe for learned love."</p>
<p>        Are you an autumn fruit of sovereign flavour?<br />
        A funeral urn awaiting tearful showers?<br />
        Of far oases the faint, wafted savour?<br />
        A dreamy pillow? or a sheaf of flowers?</p>
<p>        I have known deep, sad eyes that yet concealed<br />
        No secrets: caskets void of any gem:<br />
        Medallions where no sacred charm lay sealed,<br />
        Deep as the Skies, but vacuous like them!</p>
<p>        It is enough that your appearance flatters,<br />
        Rejoicing one who flies from truth or duty.<br />
        Your listless, cold stupidity--what matters?<br />
        Hail, mask or curtain, I adore your beauty!</p>

<p>        Neighbouring on the city, I recall<br />
        Our snow-white house, so full of peace and small:<br />
        The casts of Venus and Pomona too<br />
        Whose limbs a tiny thicket hid from view.<br />
        The sun at eve, cascading fire and gold,<br />
        Behind the glass, his sheaf of rays unrolled,<br />
        Then, like an eye, inquisitively seemed<br />
        To watch our long, hushed dinners as we dreamed;<br />
        Like candle-flames his glories, as they poured,<br />
        Lit our serge curtains and our simple board.</p>

<p>        Now the great-hearted servant, who aroused<br />
        Your jealousy, in humble earth is housed,<br />
        Let's take, at least, some flowers for her relief.<br />
        The dead, the piteous dead, know piercing grief,<br />
        And when October blows, to prune old trees,<br />
        And whistles round the marble where they freeze,<br />
        How thankless then we living must appear<br />
        Between warm sheets to sleep in comfort here,<br />
        While, eaten by black dreams, they lie in woe<br />
        Warm bedmates and their gossip to forego,<br />
        Frostbitten skeletons, tunneled by vermin,<br />
        To bear the moulting drip of Winter's ermine.<br />
        For ages, with no friends nor kindred there<br />
        The tatters on their railings to repair.</p>
<p>        On evenings when the hearth-logs hiss and flare<br />
        Were I to see her calmly take her chair:<br />
        Or, in the calm and blue December gloom,<br />
        Huddle within the corner of my room,<br />
        Gravely returning from her bed eternal<br />
        To tend this grown-up child with the maternal<br />
        Care of old times--how could I then reply<br />
        To see the tears roll from each hollow eye?</p>

<p>        O Autumns, Winters, Springs! Seasons of mire!<br />
        Soul-drowsing times! I love you. Take my praise<br />
        For shrouding thus my heart and brain entire<br />
        In a vague tomb and winding-sheet of haze.</p>
<p>        Through the long nights when the south-wester swings<br />
        The rusty vanes that shriek upon the towers,<br />
        My soul can fully stretch its raven wings<br />
        More easily than in the warmer hours.</p>
<p>        Nothing is sweeter to funereal hearts<br />
        On whom the frost of ages has been laid--<br />
        Wan seasons, when you queen it round these parts,--</p>
<p>        Than the eternal sight of your pale shade:<br />
        Unless on moonless midnights, pair by pair,<br />
        To lull, upon chance beds, our hearts' despair.</p>

<p>                                   I.</p>
<p>        Of the dread landscape that I saw,<br />
        Where human eyes were never set,<br />
        I still am ravished by the awe<br />
        That, vague and distant, haunts me yet.</p>
<p>        Sleep is of miracles so fain<br />
        That I (O singular caprice!)<br />
        As being formless, could obtain<br />
        That vegetable life should cease.</p>
<p>        A painter, in my genius free,<br />
        I there exulted in the fettle<br />
        Derived from a monotony<br />
        Composed of marble, lymph, and metal.</p>
<p>        Babels of stairways and arcades,<br />
        Endless and topless to behold,<br />
        With ponds, and jets, and steep cascades<br />
        Filling receptacles of gold:</p>
<p>        Ponderous cataracts there swung<br />
        Like crystal curtains, foaming shawls--<br />
        Dazzling and glittering they hung<br />
        Suspended from the metal walls.</p>
<p>        Not trees, but colonnades, enclosed<br />
        Motionless lakes, besides whose shelves<br />
        Gigantic naiades reposed,<br />
        Like women, gazing at themselves.</p>
<p>        Blue sheets of water interlay<br />
        Unnumbered quays of green and rose,<br />
        That stretched a million leagues away<br />
        To where the bounds of space impose.</p>
<p>        'Twas formed of unknown stones that blazed<br />
        And magic waves that intersect,<br />
        Where icebergs floated, seeming dazed<br />
        With all they mirror and reflect.</p>
<p>        Impassive, cold, and taciturn,<br />
        Great Ganges, through the sky's vast prism,<br />
        Each poured the treasures of its urn<br />
        Into a diamond abysm.</p>
<p>        Architect of my fairy scene,<br />
        I willed, by wondrous stratagems,<br />
        An ocean, tamed, to pass between<br />
        A tunnel that was made of gems.</p>
<p>        There all things, even the colour black.<br />
        Seemed irridescently to play,<br />
        And liquid crystalised its lack<br />
        Of outline in a frozen ray.</p>
<p>        No star, no sun could be discerned,<br />
        Even low down, in that vast sky:<br />
        The fire was personal that burned<br />
        To show these marvels to the eye.</p>
<p>        Above these moving wonders sheer<br />
        There soared (that such a thing should be!<br />
        All for the eye, none for the ear!)<br />
        A silence of eternity.</p>
<p>                                  II.</p>
<p>        My opening eyes, as red as coal,<br />
        The horror of my lodging met.<br />
        I felt re-entering my soul<br />
        The knife of cares and vain regret.</p>
<p>        The clock with brutal accent played<br />
        Funereal chimes. The time was noon.<br />
        And heaven covered, with its shade,<br />
        The world, this fatuous balloon!</p>

<p>        ReveillÃ© in the barracks and the camps.<br />
        The wind of morning blew upon the lamps.<br />
        It was the hour when evil dreams in swarms<br />
        On pillows twist brown, adolescent forms:<br />
        When like a bleeding eye that's twitched with pain<br />
        Each lantern smudged the day with crimson stain:<br />
        The soul, against its body's weight of brawn,<br />
        Lay struggling, like the lanterns with the dawn:<br />
        Like a sad face whose tears the breezes dry<br />
        The air grew tremulous with things that fly,<br />
        And women tired of love, and men of writing.</p>
<p>        The chimneys, here and there, showed fires were lighting.<br />
        Women of pleasure, slumber to be-slut,<br />
        Lay open-mouthed with livid eyelids shut.<br />
        Dangling thin dugs, cold pauper-women blew<br />
        Upon the embers and their fingers too.<br />
        It was the hour when, what with cold and squalor,<br />
        Women in labour aggravate their dolour,<br />
        And like a sob, choked short with bloody froth,<br />
        The cock-crow tore the foggy air as cloth.</p>
<p>        Like seas the mists round every building poured<br />
        While agonising patients in the ward,<br />
        In broken hiccoughs, rattled out their lives:<br />
        And worn-out rakes reeled homeward to their wives.<br />
        Aurora, in a shift of rose and green,<br />
        Came shivering down the Seine's deserted scene<br />
        And Paris, as he rubbed his eyes, began<br />
        To sort his tools, laborious old man.</p>

<p>        One night the wine was singing in the bottles:<br />
        "Mankind, dear waif, I send to you, in spite<br />
        Of prisoning glass and rosy wax that throttles,<br />
        A song that's full of brotherhood and light.</p>
<p>        I know what toil, and pain, and sweat you thole,<br />
        Under the roasting sun on slopes of fire,<br />
        To give me life and to beget my soul--<br />
        So I will not be thankless to my sire,</p>
<p>        Because I feel a wondrous joy to dive<br />
        Down, down the throat of some work-wearied slave.<br />
        His warm chest is a tomb wherein I thrive<br />
        Better than in my subterranean cave.</p>
<p>        Say, can you hear that rousing catch resound<br />
        Which hope within my beating heart sings high?<br />
        (With elbows on the table, sprawl around,<br />
        Contented hearts! my name to glorify.)</p>
<p>        I'll light the eyes of your delighted wife.<br />
        Your son I'll give both rosy health and muscle<br />
        And be to that frail athlete of this life<br />
        Like oil that primes the wrestler for the tussle.</p>
<p>        In you I fall, ambrosia from above,<br />
        Sown by the hand of the eternal Power,<br />

<p>        Often, in some red street-lamp's glare, whose flame<br />
        The wind flaps, rattling at its glassy frame,<br />
        In the mired labyrinth of some old slum<br />
        Where crawling multitudes ferment their scum--</p>
<p>        With judge-like nods, a rag-picker comes reeling,<br />
        Bumping on walls, like poets, without feeling,<br />
        And scorning cops, now vassals of his state,<br />
        Begins on glorious subjects to dilate,</p>
<p>        Takes royal oaths, dictates his laws sublime,<br />
        Exalts the injured, and chastises crime,<br />
        And, spreading his own daÃ¯s on the sky,<br />
        Is dazzled by his virtues, starred on high.</p>
<p>        Yes, these folk, badgered by domestic care,<br />
        Ground down by toil, decrepitude, despair,<br />
        Buckled beneath the foul load that each carries,<br />
        The motley vomit of enormous Paris--</p>
<p>        Come home, vat-scented, trailing clouds of glory,<br />
        Followed by veteran comrades, battle-hoary,<br />
        Whose whiskers stream like banners as each marches.<br />
        --Flags, torches, flowers, and steep triumphal arches</p>
<p>        Rise up for them in magic hues and burn,<br />
        Since through this dazzling orgy they return,<br />

<p>        To lull their laziness and drown their rancour,<br />

<p>        My wife is dead. I'm free. From hence<br />
        I'll drink my fill, and that's the truth!<br />
        Each time I came back with no pence,<br />
        Her screechings drilled me like a tooth.</p>
<p>        Now I'm as happy as a king . . .<br />
        Air pure, a cloudless sky above.<br />
        I can remember such a thing<br />
        The summer that we fell in love.</p>
<p>        To quench the thirst that tears my throat<br />
        It would require the vats to flow<br />
        Enough to set her tomb afloat--<br />
        And that's no thimbleful, oh no!</p>
<p>        I threw her in a well to drown.<br />
        With the walled rocks that round it stood,<br />
        To keep her there, and hold her down--<br />
        I would forget her if I could!</p>
<p>        Pleading our early tender vows,<br />
        Which naught could break for evermore,<br />
        To reconcile us, spouse to spouse,<br />
        In the same raptures as before--</p>
<p>        I begged of her a _rendez-vous_<br />
        One evening in a gloomy lane.<br />
        She came--a crazy thing to do!<br />
        We all are more-or-less insane!</p>
<p>        She still was quite attractive, though<br />
        A little tired and ill: and I<br />
        Still loved her more than ever: so<br />
        I said, "Get out of life, and die!"</p>
<p>        None understand me. Could a single<br />
        "Drunk" of the stupid sort design,<br />
        On morbid nights, by his own ingle,<br />
        To make a winding sheet of wine?</p>
<p>        Of dense invulnerable stuff,<br />
        Like engines built to shunt or shove,<br />
        They've never known, through smooth or rough,<br />
        The veritable power of love,</p>
<p>        Its black enchantments, fiery trials.<br />
        Processions of infernal pains,<br />
        Its burning tears, its poison phials,<br />
        Its rattling bones, and jingling chains.</p>
<p>        Now I am free and all alone.<br />
        To-night I'll get dead-drunk, of course.<br />
        My head I'll pillow on a stone<br />
        Without repentance or remorse.</p>
<p>        And there I'll sleep like any dog.<br />
        The lumbering cart with massive wheels<br />
        Piled up with stones, or peat, or bog,<br />
        Or hurtling wagon, as it reels</p>
<p>        May crush my skull in, like a clod,<br />
        Or halve me at the crossing-level.<br />
        I'd care as little as for God,<br />
        The Ten Commandments, or the Devil.</p>

<p>        Oh, what a splendour fills all space!<br />
        Without bit, spur, or rein to race,<br />
        Let's gallop on the steeds of wine<br />
        To heavens magic and divine!</p>
<p>        Now like two angels off the track,<br />
        Whom wild relentless fevers rack,<br />
        On through the morning's crystal blue<br />
        The swift mirages we'll pursue.</p>
<p>        Now softly poised upon the wings<br />
        That a sagacious cyclone brings,<br />
        In parallel delirium twinned,</p>
<p>        While side by side we surf the wind,<br />
        We'll never cease from such extremes,<br />
        To seek the Eden of our dreams!</p>

<p>                             _Destruction_</p>
<p>        Always the Demon fidgets here beside me<br />
        And swims around, impalpable as air:<br />
        I drink him, feel him burn the lungs inside me<br />
        With endless evil longings and despair.</p>
<p>        Sometimes, knowing my love of Art, he uses<br />
        Seductive forms of women: and has thus,<br />
        With specious, hypocritical excuses,<br />
        Accustomed me to philtres infamous.</p>
<p>        Leading me wayworn into wastes untrod<br />
        Of boundless Boredom, out of sight of God,<br />
        Using all baits to compass my abduction.</p>
<p>        Into my eyes, confused and full of woe,<br />
        Soiled clothes and bleeding gashes he will throw<br />
        And all the grim regalia of Destruction.</p>

<p>                     (Drawing by an Unknown Master)</p>
<p>        Amongst gilt fabrics, flasks of scent and wine,<br />
        Rich furniture, white marble, precious moulds.<br />
        Fine paintings, and rich, perfumed robes that shine<br />
        Swirled into sumptuous folds,</p>
<p>        In a warm room, that like a hot-house stifles<br />
        With dangerous and fatal breath, where lie<br />
        Pale flowers in crystal tombs, exquisite trifles,<br />
        Exhaling their last sigh--</p>
<p>        A headless corpse, cascading in a flood<br />
        Hot, living blood, that soaks, with crimson stain<br />
        A pillow slaked and sated with blood<br />
        As any field with rain.</p>
<p>        Like those pale visions which the gloom aborts<br />
        Which fix us in a still, hypnotic stare,<br />
        The head, tricked out with gems of sorts,<br />
        In its huge mass of hair,</p>
<p>        Like a ranunculous beside the bed,<br />
        Rests on the table, empty of all thought.<br />
        From eyes revulsed, like twilight, seems to spread<br />
        A gaze that looks at naught.</p>
<p>        Upon the bed the carcase, unabashed,<br />
        Shows, in complete abandon, without shift,<br />
        The secret splendour that, in life, it flashed<br />
        Superbly, Nature's gift.</p>
<p>        A rosy stocking, freaked with clocks of gold,<br />
        Clings to one leg: a souvenir, it seems:<br />
        The garter, from twin diamonds, with the cold<br />
        Stare of a viper gleams.</p>
<p>        The singular effect of solitude<br />
        And of a languorous portrait, with its eyes<br />
        Provocative as is its attitude,<br />
        Dark loves would advertise--</p>
<p>        And guilty joys, with feasts of strange delight,<br />
        Full of infernal kisses, omens certain<br />
        To please the gloating angels of the Night<br />
        Who swim behind each curtain.</p>
<p>        And yet to see her nimble strength, the risky<br />
        Swerve of the rounded shoulder, and its rake,<br />
        The tented haunch, the figure lithe and frisky,<br />
        Flexed like an angry snake,</p>
<p>        You'd know that she was young. Her soul affronted,<br />
        Her senses stung with boredom--were they bayed<br />
        By packs of wandering, lost desires, and hunted,<br />
        And finally betrayed?</p>
<p>        The vengeful man, whose lust you could not sate,<br />
        (In spite of much love) nor quench his fire--<br />
        Did he on your dead flesh then consummate<br />
        His monstrous, last desire?--</p>
<p>        Answer me, corpse impure! With fevered fist,<br />
        Grim visage, did he raise you up on high,<br />
        And, as your silver frosty teeth he kissed,<br />
        Bid you his last goodbye?</p>
<p>        Far from inquiring magistrates that sneer,<br />
        Far from this world of raillery and riot,<br />
        Sleep peacefully, strange creature, on your bier,<br />
        Of mystery and quiet.</p>
<p>        Your lover roams the world. Your deathless shape<br />
        Watches his sleep and hears each indrawn breath.<br />
        No more than you can he ever escape<br />
        From constancy till death!</p>

<p>        Like pensive cattle lying on the sand<br />
        They scan the far horizon of the ocean,<br />
        Foot seeking foot, hand magnetising hand,<br />
        With sweet or bitter tremors of emotion.</p>
<p>        Some with their hearts absorbed in confidences,<br />
        Deep in the woods, where streamlets chatter free,<br />
        Spell the loved names of childish, timid fancies,<br />
        And carve the green wood of the fresh, young tree.</p>
<p>        Others, like sisters wander, slow and grave,<br />
        Through craggy haunts of ghostly emanations,<br />
        Where once Saint Anthony was wont to brave<br />
        The purple-breasted pride of his temptations.</p>
<p>        Some by the light of resin-scented torches<br />
        In the dumb hush of caverns seek their shrine,<br />
        Invoking Bacchus, killer of remorses,<br />
        To liven their delirium with wine.</p>
<p>        Others who deal with scapulars and hoods<br />
        Hiding the whiplash under their long train,<br />
        Mingle, on lonely nights in sombre woods,<br />
        The foam of pleasure with the tears of pain.</p>
<p>        O demons, monsters, virgins, martyrs, you<br />
        Who trample base reality in scorn,<br />
        Whether as nuns or satyrs you pursue<br />
        The infinite, with cries or tears forlorn,</p>
<p>        You, whom my soul has tracked to lairs infernal,<br />
        Poor sisterhood, I pity and adore,<br />
        For your despairing griefs, your thirst eternal,<br />
        And love that floods your hearts for evermore!</p>

<p>                         _The Two Good Sisters_</p>
<p>        Debauchery and Death are pleasant twins,<br />
        And lavish with their charms, a buxom pair!<br />
        Under the rags that clothe their virgin skins,<br />
        Their wombs, though still in labour, never bear.</p>
<p>        For the curst poet, foe to married rest,<br />
        The friend of hell, and courtier on half-pay--<br />
        Brothels and tombs reserve for such a guest<br />
        A bed on which repentance never lay.</p>
<p>        Both tomb and bed, in blasphemy so fecund<br />
        Each other's hospitality to second,<br />
        Prepare grim treats, and hatch atrocious things.</p>
<p>        Debauch, when will you bury me? When, Death,<br />
        Mingle your Cypress in the selfsame wreath<br />
        With the infected Myrtles that she brings?</p>

<p>                        _The Fountain of Blood_</p>
<p>        My blood in waves seems sometimes to be spouting<br />
        As though in rhythmic sobs a fountain swooned.<br />
        I hear its long, low, rushing sound till, doubting,<br />
        I feel myself all over for the wound.</p>
<p>        Across the town, as in the lists of battle,<br />
        It flows, transforming paving stones to isles,<br />
        Slaking the thirst of creatures, men, and cattle,<br />
        And colouring all nature red for miles.</p>
<p>        Sometimes I've sought relief in precious wines<br />
        To lull in me the fear that undermines,<br />
        But found they sharpened every sense the more.</p>
<p>        I've also sought forgetfulness in lust,<br />
        But love's a bed of needles, and they thrust<br />
        To give more drink to each rapacious whore.</p>

<p>        She is a woman of appearance fine<br />
        Who lets her tresses trail into her wine.<br />
        Love's claws and poisons, brewed in sinks of sin,<br />
        Fall blunted from the granite of her skin.<br />
        She mocks Debauchery, Death leaves her blithe,<br />
        Two monsters always handy with the scythe.<br />
        In their grim games, where so much beauty's wrecked,<br />
        They treat her majesty with due respect.<br />
        Half goddess, half sultana, without scathe,<br />
        In pleasure she's a Moslem's steady faith.<br />
        Between her open arms, filled by her breasts,<br />
        For all mankind with burning eyes she quests,<br />
        And she believes, this fruitless virgin-wife,<br />
        Who's yet so necessary to this life,<br />
        That beauty of the body is a gift<br />
        Sublime enough all infamy to shift,<br />
        And win forgiveness. She knows naught of Hell.<br />
        When the Night comes, in which she is to dwell,<br />
        Straight in the face she'll look her deadly Fate,<br />
        Like one new-born--without remorse or hate.</p>

<p>                               _Beatrice_</p>
<p>        In charred and ashen fields without a leaf,<br />
        While I alone to Nature told my grief,<br />
        I sharpened, as I went, like any dart,<br />
        My thought upon the grindstone of my heart--<br />
        When by a troop of vicious demons led,<br />
        A great black cloud rushed down towards my head.<br />
        As loafers at a lunatic they leered<br />
        And in my face inquisitively peered.<br />
        With nods and signs, like dwarfed and apish elves,<br />
        They laughed, and winked, and spoke among themselves.</p>
<p>        "This parody of Hamlet, take his measure,<br />
        And contemplate the travesty at leisure.<br />
        Is it not sad to see the puzzled stare,<br />
        The halting gait, and the dishevelled hair<br />
        With which this clownish actor, on half-pay,<br />
        Because he is an artist in his way,<br />
        Attempts to interest, in the griefs he sings,<br />
        Eagles, and crickets, flowers, and running springs,<br />
        And even us, the authors of his woe,<br />
        Howling his sorrows as a public show?"</p>
<p>        I could have dominated with my pride<br />
        That horde of demons and the taunts they cried,<br />
        Just by the mere aversion of my face--<br />
        Had I not seen, amongst that evil race,<br />
        (A crime that did not even daze the sun!)<br />
        Queen of my heart, the peerless, only one,<br />
        Laughing with them to see my dark distress,<br />
        And giving them, at times, some lewd caress.</p>

<p>                          _Voyage to Cytherea_</p>
<p>        My heart, a bird, seemed joyfully to fly<br />
        And round the rigging cruised with nimble gyre.<br />
        The vessel rolled beneath the cloudless sky<br />
        Like a white angel, drunk with solar fire.</p>
<p>        What is that sad, black island like a pall?<br />
        Why, Cytherea, famed in many a book,<br />
        The Eldorado of old-stagers. Look:<br />
        It's but a damned poor country after all!</p>
<p>        Isle of sweet secrets and heart-feasting fire!<br />
        Of antique Venus the majestic ghost<br />
        Rolls like a storm of fragrance from your coast<br />
        Filling our souls with languor and desire!</p>
<p>        Isle of green myrtles, where each flower uncloses.<br />
        Adored by nations till the end of time:<br />
        Sighs of adoring hearts, like incense, climb.<br />
        And pour their perfume over sheaves of roses.</p>
<p>        Or groves of turtles in an endless coo!<br />
        But no! it was a waste where nothing grows,<br />
        Torn only by the raucous cries of crows:<br />
        Yet there a curious object rose in view.</p>
<p>        This was no temple hid in bosky trees,<br />
        Where the young priestess, amorous of flowers,<br />
        Whom secretly a loving flame devours,<br />
        Walks with her robe half-open to the breeze.</p>
<p>        For as we moved inshore to coast the shallows<br />
        And our white canvas scared the crows to fly,<br />
        Like a tall cypress, blackened on the sky,<br />
        We saw it was a gaunt three-forking gallows.</p>
<p>        Fierce birds, perched on their meal, began to slash<br />
        And rip with rage a rotten corpse that swung.<br />
        Each screwed and chiselled with its beak among<br />
        The crisp and bleeding crannies of the hash.</p>
<p>        His eyes were holes: from open stomach direly<br />
        His heavy tripes cascaded to his thighs.<br />
        Gorged with such ghastly dainties to the eyes,<br />
        His torturers had gelded him entirely.</p>
<p>        Beneath, some jealous prowling quadrupeds,<br />
        With lifted muzzles, for the leavings scrambled.<br />
        The largest seemed, as in the midst he gambolled,<br />
        An executioner among his _aides_.</p>
<p>        Native of Cytherea's cloudless clime<br />
        In silent suffering you paid the price,<br />
        And expiated ancient cults of vice<br />
        With generations of forbidden crime.</p>
<p>        Ridiculous hanged man! Your griefs I know.<br />
        I felt, to see you swing above the heath,<br />
        Like nausea slowly rising to my teeth,<br />
        The bilious stream of ancient human woe.</p>
<p>        Poor devil, dear to memory! before me<br />
        I seemed to feel each talon, fang, and beak<br />
        Of all the stinking crows and panthers sleek<br />
        That in my lifetime ever chewed and tore me.</p>
<p>        The sky was charming and the sea unclouded,<br />
        But all was black and bloody to my mind.<br />
        As in a dismal winding-sheet entwined,<br />
        My heart was in this allegory shrouded.</p>
<p>        A gallows where my image hung apart<br />
        Was all I found on Venus' isle of sighs.<br />
        O God, give me the strength to scrutinise,<br />
        Without disgust, my body and my heart!</p>

<p>        With bold and insolent grimace,<br />
        Love laughingly bestrides<br />
        The bare skull of the Human Race,<br />
        And, as enthroned he rides,<br />
        Blows bubbles from his rosy cheek<br />
        Which soar into the sky<br />
        As if, beyond the blue, to seek<br />
        The other worlds on high.<br />
        They ride with wondrous verve at first,<br />
        Reflect the sunny beams,<br />
        Then spit their flimsy souls, to burst<br />
        And fade like golden dreams.<br />
        I hear the skull at each renewal<br />
        Expostulate aghast--<br />
        "This game, ridiculous and cruel--<br />
        When will it end at last?<br />
        For what your cruel mouthpiece drains<br />
        And scatters, sud by sud,<br />
        Monstrous Assassin! is my brains,<br />
        My substance, and my blood."</p>

<p>     The following Author's Note was printed, in the first edition<br />
     of LES FLEURS DU MAL (1857).</p>
<p>     Among the following poems, the most notorious one has already<br />
     appeared in one of the principal literary reviews of Paris;<br />
     it has been taken, at least by intelligent people, for what<br />
     it is, a _pastiche_ on the arguments used by ignorance and<br />
     anger. Keeping the painful task which he has set himself, the<br />
     author of LES FLEURS DU MAL has, like a true comedian, assumed<br />
     the attitudes of sophistry and of corruption. No doubt, this<br />
     candid statement will not prevent "honest" critics from<br />
     ranking him among the theologians of the mob, and accusing him<br />
     of being sorry that our Saviour Jesus Christ, the eternal,<br />
     voluntary victim, did not play the role of a conqueror, of a<br />
     destroying and equalitarian Attila. Many will doubtless utter<br />
     the Pharisee's usual thanksgiving: "I thank Thee, Lord, that I<br />
     am not as this infamous poet".</p>

<p>                      _The Denial of Saint Peter_</p>
<p>        What does God do with that huge storm of curses<br />
        That rises daily to the seraphim?<br />
        Like some gorged tyrant, while his guts he nurses,<br />
        Our blasphemies are lullabies to him.</p>
<p>        Martyrs and tortured victims with their cries<br />
        Compose delicious symphonies, no doubt,<br />
        Because, despite the blood they cost, the skies<br />
        Can always do with more when they give out.</p>
<p>        Jesus, remember, in the olive trees--<br />
        In all simplicity you prayed afresh<br />
        To One whom your own butchers seemed to please<br />
        In hammering the nails into your flesh.</p>
<p>        To see your godhead spat on by the like<br />
        Of scullions, and of troopers, and such scum,<br />
        And feel the thorns into your temples strike<br />
        Which held, of all Humanity, the sum:</p>
<p>        To feel your body's horrifying weight<br />
        Lengthen your arms, to feel the blood and sweat<br />
        Itching your noble forehead pale with fate,<br />
        And as a target to the world be set,</p>
<p>        Then did you dream of brilliant days of song,<br />
        When, the eternal promise to fulfill,<br />
        You mounted on an ass and rode along,<br />
        Trampling the flowers and palms beneath your feet,</p>
<p>        When whirling whips, and full of valiant force,<br />
        The money-lenders quailed at your advance:<br />
        When you, in short, were master? Did remorse<br />
        Not pierce your body further than the lance?</p>
<p>        I am quite satisfied to leave so bored<br />
        A world, where dream and action disunite.<br />
        I'd use the sword, to perish by the sword.<br />
        Peter denied his Master? . . . He did right!</p>

<p>        Race of Abel! eat, sleep, drink.<br />

        Race of Abel! warm your guts<br />
        At the patriarchal fire.<br />
        Race of Cain! in caves and huts<br />
        Shiver like jackals in the mire.<br />
        Race of Abel! Pullulate:<br />
        Your gold too procreates its kind.<br />
        Race of Cain! Hearts hot with hate,<br />
        Leave all such appetites behind.<br />
        Race of Abel! grow and graze,<br />
        Like woodlice that on timbers prey.<br />
        Race of Cain! along rough ways<br />
        Lead forth your family at bay.</p>
<p>                                  II.</p>
<p>        Ah! Race of Abel! your fat carrion<br />
        Will well manure the soil it presses.<br />
        Race of Cain! One task to carry on<br />
        Remains for you, a task that presses.<br />
        Race of Abel! Shame is nigh.<br />
        The coulter's beaten by the sword.<br />
        Race of Cain, climb up the sky,<br />
        And to the earth hurl down the Lord.</p>

<p>        You who on Death, your old and sturdy wife,<br />

<p>        You know in what closed corners of the earth<br />
        A jealous God has hidden gems of worth.<br />
                    Satan have pity on my long despair!</p>
<p>        You know the deepest arsenals, where slumber<br />
        The breeds of buried metals without number.<br />
                    Satan have pity on my long despair!</p>
<p>        You whose huge hand has hidden the abyss<br />
        From sleepwalkers that skirt the precipice,<br />
                    Satan have pity on my long despair!</p>
<p>        You who give suppleness to drunkards' bones<br />
        When trampled down by horses on the stones,<br />
                    Satan have pity on my long despair!</p>
<p>        You who, to make his sufferings the lighter,<br />
        Taught man to mix the sulphur with the nitre,<br />
                    Satan have pity on my long despair!</p>
<p>        You fix your mask, accomplice full of guile,<br />
        On rich men's foreheads, pitiless and vile.<br />

<p>        Praise to you, Satan! in the heights you lit,<br />
        And also in the deeps where now you sit,<br />
        Vanquished, in Hell, and dream in hushed defiance.<br />
        O that my soul, beneath the Tree of Science<br />
        Might rest near you, while shadowing your brows,<br />

<p>        We shall have beds round which light scents are wafted,<br />
        Divans which are as deep and wide as tombs;<br />
        Strange flowers that under brighter skies were grafted<br />
        Will scent our shelves with rare exotic blooms.</p>
<p>        When, burning to the last their mortal ardour,<br />
        Our torch-like hearts their bannered flames unroll,<br />
        Their double light will kindle all the harder<br />
        Within the deep, twinned mirror of our soul.</p>
<p>        One evening made of mystic rose and blue,<br />
        I will exchange a lightning-flash with you,<br />
        Like a long sob that bids a last adieu.</p>
<p>        Later, the Angel, opening the door<br />
        Faithful and happy, will at last renew<br />
        Dulled mirrors, and the flames that leap no more.</p>

<p>                         _The Death of Paupers_</p>
<p>        It's Death comforts us, alas! and makes us live.<br />
        It is the goal of life, it brings us hope,<br />
        And, like a rich elixir, seems to give<br />
        Courage to march along the darkening slope.</p>
<p>        Across the tempest, hail, and hoarfrost, look!<br />
        Along the black horizon, a faint gleam!<br />
        It is the inn that's written in the book<br />
        Where one can sleep, and eat, and sit and dream.</p>
<p>        An Angel, in magnetic hands it holds<br />
        Sleep and the gift of sweet ecstatic dreams,<br />
        And makes a bed for poor and naked souls.</p>
<p>        It is God's glory and the mystic grange:<br />
        The poor man's purse and fatherland it seems,<br />
        And door that opens Heavens vast and strange.</p>

<p>        How often must I shake my bells, and kiss<br />
        Your brow, sad Travesty? How many a dart,<br />
        My quiver, shoot at Nature's mystic heart<br />
        Before I hit the target that I miss?</p>
<p>        We'll still consume our souls in subtle schemes,<br />
        Demolishing tough harness, long before<br />
        We see the giant Creature of our dreams<br />
        Whom all the world is weeping to adore.</p>
<p>        Some never knew their Idol, though they prayed:<br />
        And these doomed sculptors, with an insult branded,<br />
        Hammer your brows and bosom, heavy-handed,</p>
<p>        In the one hope, O Capitol of shade!<br />
        That Death like some new sun should rise and give<br />
        Warmth to their wasted flowers, and make them live.</p>

<p>        Under the wan, dejected skies,<br />
        Impudent, raucous, full of treason,<br />
        This life runs dancing without reason.<br />
        Voluptuous night begins to rise,</p>
<p>        Appeasing even those who fast,<br />
        Ravenous hunger making tame,<br />
        And hiding all things, even shame,<br />
        Until the Poet says, "At last</p>
<p>        My spirit, like my weary spine,<br />
        Can do with slumber, that is certain,<br />
        Sad dreams invade this heart of mine.</p>
<p>        I'm off to lie down on my back,<br />
        And roll myself into your curtain,<br />
        Refreshing shadows, dense and black!"</p>

<p>        Have you known such a savoury grief as I?<br />
        Do people say "Strange fellow!", whom you meet?<br />
        --My amorous soul, when I was due to die,<br />
        Felt longing mixed with horror; pain seemed sweet.</p>
<p>        Anguish and ardent hope (no factious whim)<br />
        Were mixed: and as the sands of life ran low<br />
        My torture grew delicious yet more grim,<br />
        And of this dear old world would not let go.</p>
<p>        I seemed a child, so keen to see the Show<br />
        He feels a deadly hatred of the Curtain . . .<br />
        And then I saw the hard, cold truth for certain.</p>
<p>        I felt that dreadful dawn around me grow<br />
        With no surprise or vestige of a thrill.<br />
        The curtain rose--and I stayed waiting still.</p>

<p>                           TO MAXIME DU CAMP</p>
<p>        For children crazed with postcards, prints, and stamps<br />
        All space can scarce suffice their appetite.<br />
        How vast the world seems by the light of lamps,<br />
        But in the eyes of memory how slight!</p>
<p>        One morning we set sail, with brains on fire,<br />
        And hearts swelled up with rancorous emotion,<br />
        Balancing, to the rhythm of its lyre,<br />
        Our infinite upon the finite ocean.</p>
<p>        Some wish to leave their venal native skies,<br />
        Some flee their birthplace, others change their ways,<br />
        Astrologers who've drowned in Beauty's eyes,<br />
        Tyrannic Circe with the scent that slays.</p>
<p>        Not to be changed to beasts, they have their fling<br />
        With space, and splendour, and the burning sky.<br />
        The suns that bronze them and the frosts that sting<br />
        Efface the mark of kisses by and by.</p>
<p>        But the true travellers are those who go<br />
        Only to get away: hearts like balloons<br />
        Unballasted, with their own fate aglow,<br />
        Who know not why they fly with the monsoons:</p>
<p>        Those whose desires are in the shape of clouds.<br />
        And dream, as raw recruits of shot and shell,<br />
        Of mighty raptures in strange, transient crowds<br />
        Of which no human soul the name can tell.</p>
<p>                                   II</p>
<p>        Horror! We imitate the top and bowl<br />
        In swerve and bias. Through our sleep it runs.<br />
        It's Curiosity that makes us roll<br />
        As the fierce Angel whips the whirling suns.</p>
<p>        Singular game! where the goal changes places;<br />
        The winning-post is nowhere, yet all round;<br />
        Where Man tires not of the mad hope he races<br />
        Thinking, some day, that respite will be found.</p>
<p>        Our soul's like a three-master, where one hears<br />
        A voice that from the bridge would warn all hands.<br />
        Another from the foretop madly cheers<br />
        "Love, joy, and glory" . . . Hell! we're on the sands!</p>
<p>        The watchmen think each isle that heaves in view<br />
        An Eldorado, shouting their belief.<br />
        Imagination riots in the crew<br />
        Who in the morning only find a reef.</p>
<p>        The fool that dotes on far, chimeric lands--<br />
        Put him in irons, or feed him to the shark!<br />
        The drunken sailor's visionary lands<br />
        Can only leave the bitter truth more stark.</p>
<p>        So some old vagabond, in mud who grovels,<br />
        Dreams, nose in air, of Edens sweet to roam.<br />
        Wherever smoky wicks illumine hovels<br />
        He sees another Capua or Rome.</p>

<p>        Amazing travellers, what noble stories<br />
        We read in the deep oceans of your gaze!<br />
        Show us your memory's casket, and the glories<br />
        Streaming from gems made out of stars and rays!</p>
<p>        We, too, would roam without a sail or steam,<br />
        And to combat the boredom of our jail,<br />
        Would stretch, like canvas on our souls, a dream,<br />
        Framed in horizons, of the seas you sail.</p>

        We have seen sands and shores and oceans too,<br />
        In spite of shocks and unexpected graves,<br />
        We have been bored, at times, the same as you.</p>
<p>        The solar glories on the violet ocean<br />
        And those of spires that in the sunset rise,<br />
        Lit, in our hearts, a yearning, fierce emotion<br />
        To plunge into those ever-luring skies.</p>
<p>        The richest cities and the scenes most proud<br />
        In nature, have no magic to enamour<br />
        Like those which hazard traces in the cloud<br />
        While wistful longing magnifies their glamour.</p>
<p>        Enjoyment adds more fuel for desire,<br />
        Old tree, to which all pleasure is manure;<br />
        As the bark hardens, so the boughs shoot higher,<br />
        And nearer to the sun would grow mature.</p>
<p>        Tree, will you always flourish, more vivacious<br />
        Than cypress?--None the less, these views are yours:<br />
        We took some photographs for your voracious<br />
        Album, who only care for distant shores.</p>
<p>        We have seen idols elephantine-snouted,<br />
        And thrones with living gems bestarred and pearled,<br />
        And palaces whose riches would have routed<br />
        The dreams of all the bankers in the world.</p>
<p>        We have seen wonder-striking robes and dresses,<br />
        Women whose nails and teeth the betel stains<br />
        And jugglers whom the rearing snake caresses."</p>

<p>            "O childish little brains,<br />
        Not to forget the greatest wonder there--<br />
        We've seen in every country, without searching,<br />
        From top to bottom of the fatal stair<br />
        Immortal sin ubiquitously lurching:</p>
<p>        Woman, a vile slave, proud in her stupidity,<br />
        Self-worshipping, without the least disgust:<br />
        Man, greedy, lustful, ruthless in cupidity,<br />
        Slave to a slave, and sewer to her lust:</p>
<p>        The torturer's delight, the martyr's sobs,<br />
        The feasts where blood perfumes the giddy rout:<br />
        Power sapping its own tyrants: servile mobs<br />
        In amorous obeisance to the knout:</p>
<p>        Some similar religions to our own,<br />
        All climbing skywards: Sanctity who treasures,<br />
        As in his downy couch some dainty drone,<br />
        In horsehair, nails, and whips, his dearest pleasures.</p>
<p>        Prating Humanity, with genius raving,<br />
        As mad today as ever from the first,<br />
        Cries in fierce agony, its Maker braving,<br />
        'O God, my Lord and likeness, be thou cursed!'</p>
<p>        But those less dull, the lovers of Dementia,<br />
        Fleeing the herd which fate has safe impounded,<br />
        In opium seek for limitless adventure.<br />

<p>        It's bitter knowledge that one learns from travel.<br />
        The world so small and drab, from day to day,<br />
        The horror of our image will unravel,<br />
        A pool of dread in deserts of dismay.</p>
<p>        Must we depart, or stay? Stay if you can.<br />
        Go if you must. One runs: another hides<br />
        To baffle Time, that fatal foe to man.<br />
        And there are runners, whom no rest betides,</p>
<p>        Like the Apostles or the Wandering Jew,<br />
        Whom neither ship nor waggon can enable<br />
        To cheat the retiary. But not a few<br />
        Have killed him without stirring from their cradle.</p>
<p>        But when he sets his foot upon our nape<br />
        We still can hope and cry "Leave all behind!"<br />
        As in old times to China we'll escape<br />
        With eyes turned seawards, hair that fans the wind,--</p>
<p>        We'll sail once more upon the sea of Shades<br />
        With heart like that of a young sailor beating.<br />
        I hear the rich, sad voices of the Trades<br />
        Who cry "This Way! all you who would be eating</p>
<p>        The scented Lotus. Here it is they range<br />
        The piles of magic fruit. O hungry friend,<br />
        Come here and swoon away into the strange<br />
        Trance of an afternoon that has no end."</p>
<p>        In the familiar tones we sense the spectre.<br />
        Our Pylades stretch arms across the seas,<br />
        "To salve your heart, now swim to your Electra"<br />
        She cries, of whom we used to kiss the knees.</p>
<p>                                  VIII</p>
<p>        O Death, old Captain, it is time. Weigh anchor!<br />
        To sail beyond the doldrums of our days.<br />
        Though black as pitch the sea and sky, we hanker<br />
        For space; you know our hearts are full of rays.</p>
<p>        Pour us your poison to revive our soul!<br />
        It cheers the burning quest that we pursue,<br />
        Careless if Hell or Heaven be our goal,<br />
        Beyond the known world to seek out the New!</p>

        Adorn alike the glorious night and day:<br />
        Mother of Grecian joys and Latin games,</p>
<p>        Lesbos of kisses reckless as cascades<br />
        That hurl themselves to bottomless abysses,<br />
        Stormy and secret, myriad-swarming kisses,<br />
        That cluck and sob and gurgle in the shades.<br />
        Lesbos of kisses reckless as cascades!</p>
<p>        Lesbos where Phrynes each to each are plighted,<br />
        Where never yet unanswered went a sigh,<br />
        Where Paphos with a rival is requited,<br />
        And Venus with a Sappho has to vie!<br />
        Lesbos where Phrynes each to each are plighted,</p>
<p>        Lesbos, the land of warm and languid night,<br />
        Where gazing in their mirrors as they dress<br />
        The cave-eyed girls, in barren, vain delight,<br />
        The fruits of their nubility caress.<br />
        Lesbos, the land of warm and languid night,</p>
<p>        Let Plato frown austerely all the while.<br />
        Your pardon's from excess of kisses won.<br />
        Queen of sweet empire, rare and noble isle--<br />
        And from refinements which are never done.<br />
        Let Plato frown austerely all the while.</p>
<p>        From martyrdom your pardon you beguile,<br />
        Inflicted without stint on hearts that soar<br />
        Far, far away, drawn by some radiant smile<br />
        Seen vaguely on a strange celestial shore.<br />
        From martyrdom your pardon you beguile.</p>
<p>        Lesbos, what God to judge you would make bold,<br />
        Or damn your brows so pale and sadly grave,<br />
        Not having weighed upon the scales of gold<br />
        The floods of tears you've poured into the wave.<br />
        Lesbos which God to judge you would make bold?</p>
<p>        For us, what mean the statutes of the just?<br />
        Pride of the isles, whose hearts sublimely swell,<br />
        Your faith as any other is august<br />
        And Love can laugh alike at Heaven and Hell.<br />
        For us, what mean the statues of the just?</p>
<p>        For Lesbos chose me of all men on earth<br />
        To sing the secrets of her virgin flowers,<br />
        Taught as a child the sacred rites of mirth<br />
        And mysteries of sorrow which are ours.<br />
        So Lesbos chose me of all men on earth.</p>
<p>        Since then I watch on the Leucadian height.<br />
        Like a lone sentry with a piercing view<br />
        Who sees the vessels ere they heave in sight<br />
        With forms that faintly tremble in the blue.<br />
        Since then I watch on the Leucadian height</p>
<p>        To find out if the sea's heart still is hardened<br />
        And from the sobs that drench the rock with spray<br />
        If it will bring back Sappho, who has pardoned,<br />
        The corpse of the adored, who went away<br />
        To find out that the sea its heart has hardened;</p>
<p>        Of the male Sappho, lover, queen of singers,<br />
        More beautiful than Venus by her woes.<br />
        The blue eye cannot match the black, where lingers<br />
        The shady circle that her grief bestows<br />
        On the male Sappho, lover, queen of singers--</p>
<p>        Fairer than Venus towering on the world<br />
        And pouring down serenity like water<br />
        In the blond radiance of her tresses curled<br />
        To daze the very Ocean with her daughter,<br />
        Fairer than Venus towering on the world--</p>
<p>        Of Sappho, whom her blasphemy requited<br />
        The day she quit the rite and scorned the cult,<br />
        And gave her lovely body to be slighted<br />
        By a rough brute, whose scorn was the result<br />
        For Sappho, whom the blasphemy requited.</p>
<p>        And since that time has Lesbos lived lamenting<br />
        In spite of all the honours of mankind,<br />
        And lives upon the storm-howl unrelenting<br />
        Of its bleak shores, the sport of wave and wind:<br />
        For since that time has Lesbos lived lamenting.</p>
<p>                                  III</p>
<p>                             _Damned Women_</p>
<p>                         Delphine and Hippolyta</p>
<p>        Over deep cushions, drenched with drowsy scents<br />
        Where fading lamplight shed its dying glow,<br />
        Hippolyta recalls and half-repents<br />
        The kisses that first thawed her youthful snow.</p>
<p>        She sought, with tempest-troubled gaze, the skies<br />
        Of her first innocence, now far away,<br />
        As travellers who backward turn their eyes<br />
        To blue horizons passed at break of day.</p>
<p>        Within her haggard eyes the tears were bright.<br />
        Her broken look, her dazed, voluptuous air,<br />
        Her vanquished arms like weapons shed in flight,<br />
        Enhanced her fragile beauty with despair.</p>
<p>        Stretched at her feet Delphine contented lay<br />
        And watched with burning eyeballs from beneath<br />
        Like a fierce tigress who, to guard her prey,<br />
        Has set a mark upon it with her teeth.</p>
<p>        Strong beauty there to fragile beauty kneeling,<br />
        Superb, she seemed to sniff the heady wine<br />
        Of triumph: and stretched out to her, appealing<br />
        For the reward of raptures half-divine.</p>
<p>        She sought within her victim's pallid eye<br />
        Dumb hymns that pleasure sings without a choir,<br />
        And gratitude that, like a long-drawn sigh,<br />
        Swells from the eyelid, swooning with fire.</p>
<p>        "Hippolyta, dear heart, have you no trust?<br />
        Do you not know the folly that exposes<br />
        To the fierce pillage of the brawling gust<br />
        The sacred holocaust of early roses?</p>
<p>        My kisses are as light as fairy midges<br />
        That on calm evenings skim the crystal lake.<br />
        Those of your man would plough such ruts and ridges<br />
        As lumbering carts or tearing coulters make.</p>
<p>        They'll tramp across you, like a ruthless team<br />
        Of buffaloes or horses, yoked in lust.<br />
        Dear sister, turn your face to me, my dream,<br />
        My soul, my all, my twin, to whom I trust!</p>
<p>        Turn me your eyes of deepest, starry blue.<br />
        For one of those deep glances that you send,<br />
        I'd lift the veil of darkest joys for you<br />
        And rock you in a dream that has no end."</p>
<p>        But then Hippolyta raised up her head,<br />
        "No blame nor base ingratitude I feel,<br />
        But, as it were, a kind of nauseous dread<br />
        After some terrible, nocturnal meal.</p>
<p>        I feel a swooping terror that explodes<br />
        In legions of black ghosts towards me speeding<br />
        Who crowd me on to swiftly moving roads,<br />
        That, sliced by sheer horizons, end up bleeding.</p>
<p>        Have we done something monstrous that I tremble?<br />
        Explain, then, if you can; for when you say,<br />
        'Angel', I cower. Yet I cannot dissemble<br />
        That, when you speak, my lips are drawn your way.</p>
<p>        Oh, do not fix me with a stare so steady<br />
        You whom I love till death in still submission,<br />
        Yes, even though you, like an ambush ready,<br />
        Are the beginning of my own perdition."</p>
<p>        Then Delphine stamped and shook her tragic mane,<br />
        And, like a priestess, foaming and fierce, and fell,<br />
        Spoke in a lordly and prophetic strain<br />
        --"Who dares, in front of Love, to mention Hell?</p>
<p>        Curbed forever be that useless dreamer<br />
        Who first imagined, in his brutish mind,<br />
        Of sheer futility the fatuous schemer,<br />
        Honour with Love could ever be combined.</p>
<p>        He who in mystic union would enmesh<br />
        Shadow with warmth, and daytime with the night,<br />
        Will never warm his paralytic flesh<br />
        At the red sun of amorous delight.</p>
<p>        Go, if you wish, and seek some boorish lover:<br />
        Offer your virgin heart to his crude hold,<br />
        Full of remorse and horror you'll recover,<br />
        And bring me your scarred breast to be consoled . . .</p>
<p>        Down here, a soul can only serve one master."<br />
        But the girl, venting her tremendous woe,<br />
        Cried out "I feel a huge pit of disaster<br />
        Yawning within: it is my heart, I know!</p>
<p>        Like a volcano burning, deep as death,<br />
        There's naught that groaning monster can assuage<br />
        Nor quench of thirst the Fury's burning breath<br />
        Who brands it with a torch to make it rage.</p>
<p>        Let our closed curtains isolate the rest,<br />
        Until exhaustion bring us sleep, while I<br />
        Annihilate myself upon your breast<br />
        And find in you a tomb on which to die."</p>
<p>        Go down, go down, poor victims, it is time;<br />
        The road to endless hell awaits your lusts.<br />
        Plunge to the bottom of the gulf, where crime<br />
        Is flagellated by infernal gusts.</p>
<p>        Swirling pell-mell, and with a tempest's roar,<br />
        Mad shades, pursue your craving without measure:<br />
        Your rages will be sated nevermore,<br />
        Your torture is begotten of your pleasure.</p>
<p>        No sunbeam through your dungeon will come leaking:<br />
        Only miasmic fevers, through each chink,<br />
        Will filter, like sick lanterns, redly streaking,<br />
        And penetrate your bodies with their stink.</p>
<p>        The harsh sterility of all you relish<br />
        Will swell your thirst, and turn you both to hags.<br />
        The wind of your desire, with fury hellish<br />
        Will flog your flapping carrion like wet flags.</p>
<p>        Far from live folk, like werewolves howling high,<br />
        Gallop the boundless deserts you unroll.<br />
        Fulfill your doom, disordered minds, and fly<br />
        The infinite you carry in your soul.</p>
<p>                                   IV</p>
<p>                                _Lethe_</p>
<p>        Rest on my heart, deaf, cruel soul, adored<br />
        Tigress, and monster with the lazy air.<br />
        I long, in the black jungles of your hair,<br />
        To force each finger thrilling like a sword;</p>
<p>        Within wide skirts, filled with your scent, to hide<br />
        My bruised and battered forehead hour by hour,<br />
        And breathe, like dampness from a withered flower,<br />
        The pleasant mildew of a love that died.</p>
<p>        Rather than live, I wish to sleep, alas!<br />
        Lulled in a slumber soft and dark as death,<br />
        In ruthless kisses lavishing my breath<br />
        Upon your body smooth as burnished brass.</p>
<p>        To swallow up my sorrows in eclipse,<br />
        Nothing can match your couch's deep abysses;<br />
        The stream of Lethe issues from your kisses<br />
        And powerful oblivion from your lips.</p>
<p>        Like a predestined victim I submit:<br />
        My doom, to me, henceforth, is my delight,<br />
        A willing martyr in my own despite<br />
        Whose fervour fans the faggots it has lit.</p>
<p>        To drown my rancour and to heal its smart,<br />
        Nepenthe and sweet hemlock, peace and rest,<br />
        I'll drink from the twin summits of a breast<br />
        That never lodged the semblance of a heart.</p>
<p>                                   V</p>
<p>                        _To One Who Is Too Gay_</p>
<p>        Your head, your gestures, and your air<br />
        Are lovely as a landscape; smiles<br />
        Rimple upon your face at whiles<br />
        Like winds in the clear sky up there.</p>
<p>        The grumpy passers that you graze<br />
        Are dazzled by the radiant health,<br />
        And the illimitable wealth<br />
        Your arms and shoulders seem to blaze.</p>
<p>        The glaring colours that, in showers,<br />
        Clash in your clothes with such commotion,<br />
        In poets' minds suggest the notion<br />
        Of a mad ballet-dance of flowers.</p>
<p>        These garish dresses illustrate<br />
        Your spirit, striped with every fad.<br />
        O madwoman, whom, quite as mad,<br />
        I love as madly as I hate.</p>
<p>        Sometimes in gardens, seeking rest,<br />
        Where I have dragged my soul atonic,<br />
        I've felt the sun with gaze ironic<br />
        Tearing the heart within my breast.</p>
<p>        The spring and verdure, dressed to stagger,<br />
        Humiliate me with such power<br />
        That I have punished, in a flower,<br />
        The insolence of Nature's swagger.</p>
<p>        And so, one night, I'd like to sneak,<br />
        When night has tolled the hour of pleasure,<br />
        A craven thief, towards the treasure<br />
        Which is your person, plump and sleek.</p>
<p>        To punish your bombastic flesh,<br />
        To bruise your breast immune to pain,<br />
        To furrow down your flank a lane<br />
        Of gaping crimson, deep and fresh.</p>
<p>        And, most vertiginous delight!<br />
        Into those lips, so freshly striking<br />
        And daily lovelier to my liking--<br />
        Infuse the venom of my sprite.</p>
<p>                                   VI</p>
<p>                              _The Jewels_</p>
<p>        My well-beloved was stripped. Knowing my whim,<br />
        She wore her tinkling gems, but naught besides:<br />
        And showed such pride as, while her luck betides,<br />
        A sultan's favoured slave may show to him.</p>
<p>        When it lets off its lively, crackling sound,<br />
        This blazing blend of metal crossed with stone,<br />
        Gives me an ecstasy I've only known<br />
        Where league of sound and lustre can be found.</p>
<p>        She let herself be loved: then, drowsy-eyed,<br />
        Smiled down from her high couch in languid ease.<br />
        My love was deep and gentle as the seas<br />
        And rose to her as to a cliff the tide.</p>
<p>        My own approval of each dreamy pose,<br />
        Like a tamed tiger, cunningly she sighted:<br />
        And candour, with lubricity united,<br />
        Gave piquancy to every one she chose.</p>
<p>        Her limbs and hips, burnished with changing lustres,<br />
        Before my eyes clairvoyant and serene,<br />
        Swanned themselves, undulating in their sheen;<br />
        Her breasts and belly, of my vine the clusters,</p>
<p>        Like evil angels rose, my fancy twitting,<br />
        To kill the peace which over me she'd thrown,<br />
        And to disturb her from the crystal throne<br />
        Where, calm and solitary, she was sitting.</p>
<p>        So swerved her pelvis that, in one design,<br />
        Antiope's white rump it seemed to graft<br />
        To a boy's torso, merging fore and aft.<br />
        The talc on her brown tan seemed half-divine.</p>
<p>        The lamp resigned its dying flame. Within,<br />
        The hearth alone lit up the darkened air,<br />
        And every time it sighed a crimson flare<br />
        It drowned in blood that amber-coloured skin.</p>
<p>                                  VII</p>
<p>                   _The Metamorphoses of the Vampire_</p>
<p>        The crimson-fruited mouth that I desired--<br />
        While, like a snake on coals, she twinged and twired,<br />
        Kneading her breasts against her creaking busk--<br />
        Let fall those words impregnated with musk,<br />
        --"My lips are humid: by my learned science,<br />
        All conscience, in my bed, becomes compliance.<br />
        My breasts, triumphant, staunch all tears; for me<br />
        Old men, like little children, laugh with glee.<br />
        For those who see me naked, I replace<br />
        Sun, moon, the sky, and all the stars in space.<br />
        I am so skilled, dear sage, in arts of pleasure,<br />
        That, when with man my deadly arms I measure,<br />
        Or to his teeth and kisses yield my bust,<br />
        Timid yet lustful, fragile, yet robust,<br />
        On sheets that swoon with passion--you might see<br />
        Impotent angels damn themselves for me."</p>
<p>        When of my marrow she had sucked each bone<br />
        And, languishing, I turned with loving moan<br />
        To kiss her in return, with overplus,--<br />
        She seemed a swollen wineskin, full of pus.<br />
        I shut my eyes with horror at the sight,<br />
        But when I opened them, in the clear light,<br />
        I saw, instead of the great swollen doll<br />
        That, bloated with my lifeblood, used to loll,<br />
        The debris of a skeleton, assembling<br />
        With shrill squawks of a weathercock, lie trembling,<br />
        Or sounds, with which the howling winds commingle,<br />
        Of an old Inn-sign on a rusty tringle.</p>
<p>                              GALANTERIES</p>
<p>                                  VIII</p>
<p>                             _The Fountain_</p>
<p>        My darling of a sweetheart, close,<br />
        For a long time, your great, tired eyes,<br />
        Keeping them in that languid pose<br />
        Where pleasure took them by surprise.<br />
        Out in the court the fountain chatters<br />
        And does not cease by day or night.<br />
        The swoon of ecstasy it flatters<br />
        In which love plunges me tonight.</p>
<p>              Its sheaf uprears<br />
              A myriad flowers,<br />
              While Phoebe sheers<br />
              Through pearl-flushed hours,<br />
              To rain down tears<br />
              In glittering showers.</p>
<p>        So does your flashing soul ignite<br />
        In lightnings of voluptuous bliss<br />
        And rushes reckless up the height<br />
        As though the enchanted sky to kiss;<br />
        Then it relaxes, grows more fine,<br />
        And in sad languor falls apart<br />
        Down an invisible incline<br />
        Into the deep well of my heart.</p>
<p>              Its sheaf uprears<br />
              A myriad flowers,<br />
              While Phoebe sheers<br />
              Through pearl-flushed hours,<br />
              To rain down tears<br />
              In glittering showers.</p>
<p>        O you whom night so beautifies<br />
        How sweet unto your breast to bend<br />
        And hear the water as it sighs<br />
        Into the ponds without an end<br />
        Moon, singing water, blessed night<br />
        And trees that tremble up above--<br />
        Your melancholy charms my sprite<br />
        And is the mirror of my love.</p>
<p>              Its sheaf uprears<br />
              A myriad flowers,<br />
              While Phoebe sheers<br />
              Through pearl-flushed hours,<br />
              To rain down tears<br />
              In glittering showers.</p>
<p>                                   IX</p>
<p>                            _Bertha's Eyes_</p>
<p>        The most illustrious gaze you may despise,<br />
        Eyes of my child, where filters and takes flight<br />
        I know not what of goodness, soft as night.<br />
        Pour out on me your lovely shade, dear eyes!</p>
<p>        Great eyes of my dear child! arcanes adored!<br />
        You seem like magic caves where shadow darkles<br />
        And, through the mass of crowded gloom, there sparkles<br />
        And scintillates some richly treasured hoard.</p>
<p>        My girl has eyes as deep, vast, and serene<br />
        As you, O night, immense, and lit like you;<br />
        Their fires are thoughts of Love, with faith shot through,<br />
        Voluptuous, and chaste, though sparkling keen.</p>

<p>        To the most lovely, the most dear,<br />
        The Angel, and the deathless grail<br />
        Who fill my heart with radiance clear--<br />
        In immortality all hail!</p>
<p>        Into my life she flows translated<br />
        As saline breezes fill the sky,<br />
        And pours into my soul unsated<br />
        The taste of what can never die.</p>
<p>        Sachet, forever fresh, perfuming<br />
        Some quiet nook of hid delight;<br />
        A lone forgotten censer fuming<br />
        In secrecy across the night.</p>
<p>        How, flawless love, with truth impart<br />
        Your purity and keep it whole,<br />
        O unseen grain of musk who art<br />
        The core of my eternal soul?</p>
<p>        To the most lovely, the most dear,<br />
        The angel, and the deathless grail,<br />
        Who fill my life with radiance clear--<br />
        In immortality all hail!</p>

<p>                                   I.</p>
<p>        Beloved, certainly you're not<br />
        What Veuillot calls a "tenderling".<br />
        Bubbling in you, as in a pot,<br />
        Dice, lust and revel have their fling.<br />
        My dear old child, you're surely not</p>
<p>        Too fresh these days. However, dear,<br />
        Your tireless game of fast-and-loose<br />
        Has given you that smooth veneer,<br />
        That things acquire from constant use.<br />
        It has its charms, however dear.</p>
<p>        I do not find it growing stale--<br />
        That sap your forty summers bring<br />
        Since autumn fruits with me prevail<br />
        Over the banal flowers of spring.<br />
        No! you are never dull nor stale.</p>
<p>        Your carcase for your age atones,<br />
        And gives particular delight<br />
        In hollows of your collar bones,<br />
        And other places out of sight.<br />
        Your carcase certainly atones.</p>
<p>        A fig for those poor doting fools<br />
        Who're melon-struck and pumpkin mad,<br />
        Since I prefer your clavicules<br />
        To those King Solomon once had.<br />
        A fig for such poor doting fools!</p>
<p>        A blue-black helmet is your hair.<br />
        It shades your warrior's brow whereon<br />
        Both thoughts and blushes are so rare--<br />
        And then sweeps backward, and is gone!<br />
        A blue black helmet is your hair.</p>
<p>        Your eyes resemble mud and mire,<br />
        Whereon a flaring lantern streaks,<br />
        Reflects the fard upon your cheeks,<br />
        And glows with pale infernal fire.<br />
        Your eyes are coloured like the mire.</p>
<p>        By its voluptuous disdain<br />
        Your bitter lip provokes our lust.<br />
        It's Eden's apple once again,<br />
        Half is attraction, half disgust,<br />
        In its voluptuous disdain.</p>
<p>        Your leg, so muscular and dry,<br />
        Could climb volcanoes, never stop,<br />
        And, spite of snow, and wind, and rain,<br />
        Perform a cancan at the top.<br />
        Your leg is muscular and dry.</p>
<p>        Your burning skin is void of sweetness:<br />
        Like an old soldier's it appears.<br />
        To sweat it never had the weakness<br />
        More than your eyes could furnish tears.<br />
        And yet it has a kind of sweetness!</p>
<p>                                  II.</p>
<p>        Fool! You are driving to the Devil.<br />
        Willingly I would go with you<br />
        If the momentum of your revel<br />
        Did not exasperate me too.<br />
        Fool! go, alone, then, to the Devil.</p>
<p>        My hip, my lung, my hams, my thigh<br />
        Won't let me longer pay respects<br />
        (Although it often makes me sigh)<br />
        To that great Lord, as he expects.<br />
        It's very sad for ham and thigh.</p>
<p>        Oh most sincerely do I suffer<br />
        Not to accompany your freaks;<br />
        When he is flatulating sulphur<br />
        To see you kiss him where he leaks.<br />
        O most sincerely do I suffer!</p>
<p>        I feel so devilish annoyed<br />
        No more to serve you as a socket,<br />
        You hellish torch! Infernal rocket!<br />
        And to declare my duty void;<br />
        I do feel devilish annoyed,</p>
<p>        Since for a long, long time I love you<br />
        Being so logical. My dream<br />
        Was of all Ill to skim the cream,<br />
        Place no monstrosity above you<br />
        And own you in that line supreme.<br />
        Truly, old monster! yes, I love you.</p>

<p>        The man whose image this presents,<br />
        In art more subtle than the rest,<br />
        Teaches us sagely, as is best,<br />
        To chuckle at our own expense.</p>
<p>        In mockery he stands apart.<br />
        His energy defies an equal<br />
        In painting Evil and its sequel--<br />
        Which proves the beauty of his heart--</p>
<p>        Melmoth or Mephostopheles,<br />
        His mirth has naught akin to theirs.<br />
        The flambeau of Alecto flares<br />
        To singe them, while it makes us freeze.</p>
<p>        Their merriment they come to rue<br />
        So steeped in treachery and guile,<br />
        While his frank radiating smile<br />
        Declares him to be good and true.</p>

<p>        Amongst the myriad flowers on beauty's stem<br />

        But Lola burns with unexpected fuel<br />
        The radiance of a black and rosy jewel.</p>

<p>              _On Delacroix's picture of Tasso in Prison_</p>
<p>        The poet, sick, and with his chest half bare<br />
        Tramples a manuscript in his dark stall,<br />
        Gazing with terror at the yawning stair<br />
        Down which his spirit finally must fall.</p>
<p>        Intoxicating laughs which fill his prison<br />
        Invite him to the Strange and the Absurd.<br />
        With ugly shapes around him have arisen<br />
        Both Doubt and Terror, multiform and blurred.</p>
<p>        This genius cooped in an unhealthy hovel,<br />
        These cries, grimaces, ghosts that squirm and grovel<br />
        Whirling around him, mocking as they call,</p>
<p>        This dreamer whom these horrors rouse with screams,<br />
        They are your emblem, Soul of misty dreams<br />
        Round whom the Real erects its stifling wall.</p>

<p>                              _The Voice_</p>
<p>        My cot was next the library, a Babel<br />
        Where fiction jostled science, myth and fable.<br />
        Greek dust with Roman ash there met the sight.<br />
        And I was but a folio in height<br />
        When two Voices addressed me. "Earth's a cake,"<br />
        Said one, "and full of sweetness. I can make<br />
        Your appetite to its proportions equal<br />
        Forever and forever without sequel."<br />
        Another said "Come, rove in dreams, with me,<br />
        Past knowledge, thought or possibility".<br />
        That voice sang like the wind along the shore<br />
        And, though caressing, frightened me the more.<br />
        I answered "O sweet Voice!" and from that date<br />
        Could never name my sorrow or my fate.<br />
        Behind the giant scenery of this life<br />
        I see strange worlds: with my own self at strife,<br />
        Ecstatic victim of my second sight,<br />
        I trail huge snakes, that at my ankles bite.<br />
        And like an ancient prophet, from that time,<br />
        I've loved the desert, found the sea sublime;<br />
        I've wept at festivals and laughed at wakes:<br />
        And found in sourest wines a sweet that slakes;<br />
        Falsehoods for facts I love to swallow whole,<br />
        And often fall, star-gazing, in a hole.<br />
        But the Voice cheers--"Keep dreaming. It's a rule<br />
        No sage can dream such beauty as a fool".</p>

<p>                              _The Ransom_</p>
<p>        Man, for his ransom, has two fields,<br />
        Two fields of tufa, deep and rich,<br />
        Which he must duly delve and ditch.<br />
        His reason is the hoe he wields.</p>
<p>        In order to extort one rose,<br />
        Or to produce a few poor ears,<br />
        He has to squander showers of tears<br />
        In watering the seeds he sows.</p>
<p>        One field is Art, the other Love;<br />
        And both must for his favour bloom<br />
        When the strict Judge appears above<br />
        Upon the dreadful day of doom.</p>
<p>        Man's granges must be filled to burst<br />
        With crops and flowers, whose form and shade<br />
        Must win the angels' suffrage first<br />
        Before his ransom can be paid.</p>

<p>                        _To a Girl from Malabar_</p>
<p>        Your feet are finer than your hands, and bigger<br />
        Your haunch than plumpest white ones are. Your figure<br />
        Is to a pensive artist dear and fresh.<br />
        Your velvet eyes are darker than your flesh.<br />
        In hot blue lands, where your God gave you being,<br />
        Your task, lighting your master's pipe, and seeing<br />
        The jars well filled with lymph, the flasks with scent,<br />
        Or switching the mosquitoes--there you went,<br />
        When dawn sang through the rustling planes, to buy<br />
        Plantains or pineapples from the nearby<br />
        Bazaar. All day, at will, barefoot you passed<br />
        Humming old unknown tunes: and when at last<br />
        The sun went down, bright red, across the flat,<br />
        You flung your body on the wicker mat;<br />
        And full of humming birds, your floating dream<br />
        Was gay and flowery as you always seem.</p>
<p>        How, happy child, did you come here to France,<br />
        This overpeopled land, by what mischance,<br />
        When to your tamarinds you bade adieu<br />
        Confiding in the sailors of the crew?<br />
        But now half-clothed in muslin frail and thin,<br />
        While frost and sleet assail your shivering skin,<br />
        With brutal corsets prisoning you fast,<br />
        How you must long for the old, carefree past!<br />
        Now you must glean your dinners from the mud<br />
        And sell the perfumes of your flesh and blood,<br />
        In our foul mists, with pensive eye still straying<br />
        To catch a glimpse of phantom palm trees swaying.</p>

<p>        The clocks strike midnight one by one<br />
        Ironically to remind us,<br />
        And ask what profit we have won<br />
        Out of the day we've left behind us.<br />
        The Thirteenth, Friday, as it chances!<br />
        A fatal date; when all is said,<br />
        In spite of all we know, we've led<br />
        The most heretical of dances.</p>
<p>        Today we've spent blaspheming Jesus,<br />
        The incontestable, sole Lord;<br />
        Like a base sponger at the board<br />
        Of some intolerable Croesus,<br />
        We have, to please the beast within us,<br />
        The Devil's worthy advocate,<br />
        Defamed all that whose love should win us,<br />
        And flattered all that we should hate.</p>
<p>        The weak man, like a bullying coward,<br />
        We harmed, and wrongly did despise;<br />
        We worshipped Folly, where he towered,<br />
        Huge bull-horned monster, to the skies.<br />
        We have lain kissing stupid Matter<br />
        With great devotion to its presence,<br />
        And of Corruption stooped to flatter<br />
        The wan, mephitic phosphorescence.</p>
<p>        To drown our vertigo entire<br />
        And our delirium to nourish--<br />
        Proud priest of the immortal Lyre<br />
        Whose glory it has been to flourish<br />
        The rapture of funereal things--<br />
        We've eaten without appetite,<br />
        Unthirsting drunk of muddy springs.<br />
        Come, quick, my soul, blow out the light,<br />
        To hide in shades of blackest night!</p>

<p>                    _Epigraph for a Condemned Book_</p>
<p>        Dear reader, peaceful and bucolic,<br />
        Ingenuous, sober, hierophantic,<br />
        Lay by this book so corybantic,<br />
        So Saturnine, and melancholic.</p>
<p>        If elsewhere than in Satan's school<br />
        You learned your syntax and your grammar,<br />
        Lay by! You'll think I rave and stammer<br />
        And am a stark, hysteric fool.</p>
<p>        But if, not yielding to their charm,<br />
        Your eye can plumb the gulfs of harm--<br />
        Then learn to love me, read my verses.</p>
<p>        Inquiring sufferer, who seek<br />
        Your paradise, to you I speak:<br />
        Pity me! . . . else, receive my curses!</p>

<p>                                   I</p>
<p>        That you are good what does it matter?<br />
        Be sad: be beautiful! The rain<br />
        Rejuvenates the flowering plain.<br />
        As streams do landscapes, teardrops flatter<br />
        Your face. Your looks, by weeping, gain.</p>
<p>        When joy from your dejected forehead<br />
        Has fled, your heart is in the power<br />
        Of torment, and, to make you cower,<br />
        The huge cloud of your past, with horrid<br />
        Black shadow, overlooms the hour,</p>
<p>        I love you most: and when your eye<br />
        Pours water hot as blood in battle,<br />
        And when, despite the fact that I<br />
        Am nursing you, you give a cry<br />
        Like death, an agonising rattle.</p>
<p>        Delicious hymn, profound delight,<br />
        Pleasure divine! I breathe with zest<br />
        The sobs arising from your breast.<br />
        I think your heart must blaze the light<br />
        Of pearls that from your eyes are pressed.</p>
<p>                                   II</p>
<p>        I know your heart once more disgorges<br />
        Its old uprooted love-affairs:<br />
        And flaming with the heat of forges<br />
        You feel the pride of vanished orgies,<br />
        Which makes the damned put on such airs.</p>
<p>        But now ere yet your evil dreams<br />
        Reflect the red flames of the Pit,<br />
        While in an endless nightmare scheming<br />
        Of poison-draughts and daggers gleaming,<br />
        Cold steel and powder tempt your wit:</p>
<p>        While yet in fear the door you answer<br />
        And see all things with vague mistrust:<br />
        Free from his grasp, O dear entrancer,<br />
        And not yet partnered for a dancer<br />
        With irresistible Disgust,</p>
<p>        You'll never claim, both queen and slave,<br />
        Who only love me with affright<br />
        In the sick silence of the night,<br />
        And while your feelings inly rave--<br />
        To match with me in power or might.</p>

<p>                               _The Fang_</p>
<p>        Each Man who's fit to be so called<br />
        A Serpent in his heart has got,<br />
        As though upon a throne installed,<br />
        Who when he says "I will", says "Not".</p>
<p>        If your gaze the gaze transfixes<br />
        O satyresses or of nixies,<br />
        The Fang says, "Is your duty done?"</p>
<p>        Breed brats, plant trees, perform your task,<br />
        Write verse, chip stone--the Fang will ask,<br />
        "Will you be there at set of sun?"</p>
<p>        Men scheme each night and hope each morning,<br />
        Yet no man grows one moment riper<br />
        But suffers, at each turn, the warning<br />
        Of the insufferable viper.</p>

<p>                              _The Rebel_</p>
<p>        An angel from the sky swoops like an eagle,<br />
        Seizes the culprit's hair in his strong fist,<br />
        And shakes him, saying "You must know what's legal!<br />
        For I am your Good Angel. I insist.</p>
<p>        Know you must cherish, without wry grimaces,<br />
        The poor, deformed, blockheaded, sick, and vile:<br />
        And thus unroll for Christ's triumphal paces<br />
        The carpet of your charity in style.</p>
<p>        For such is Love! Before your heart grows dim,<br />
        Light up your heart from God and burn for him.<br />
        That is the true delight that lasts for ever".</p>
<p>        The Angel, by his love filled with more ardour,<br />
        With giant fists belabours him the harder.<br />
        The damned soul always answers, "I will never".</p>

        Tranquil and ready for her guest.</p>
<p>        With one hand she fans her nipples<br />
        Elbow on the couch at rest<br />
        Listening to the ponds and ripples.</p>
<p>        This room is Dorothy's. The play<br />
        Of wind and water, far away,<br />
        With fainting song and rhythmic sobs,<br />
        Through her reverie hums and throbs.</p>
<p>        From head to toe with greatest care<br />
        Her skin is polished, to adorn her<br />
        With benjamin and oils as rare . . .<br />
        Some flowers are swooning in a corner.</p>
<p>                                  VII</p>
<p>                              _Meditation_</p>
<p>        Be good, my Sorrow: hush now: settle down.<br />
        You sighed for dusk, and now it comes: look there!<br />
        A denser atmosphere obscures the town,<br />
        To some restoring peace, to others care.</p>
<p>        While the lewd multitude, like hungry beasts,<br />
        By pleasure scourged (no thug so fierce as he!)<br />
        Go forth to seek remorse among their feasts--<br />
        Come, take my hand; escape from them with me.</p>
<p>        From balconies of sky, around us yet,<br />
        Lean the dead years in fashions that have ceased.<br />
        Out of the depth of waters smiles Regret.</p>
<p>        The sun sinks moribund beneath an arch,<br />
        And like a long shroud rustling from the East,<br />
        Hark, Love, the gentle Night is on the march.</p>
<p>                                  VIII</p>
<p>                               _The Gulf_</p>
<p>        Wherever Pascal went, his gulf was spread,<br />
        All is abyss--dream, act, desire, or word!<br />
        And often by the wind of terror stirred<br />
        I've felt the hair shoot upright on my head.</p>
<p>        High up, low down, all round, the depth descending,<br />
        The verge, the silence, the dread captor, Space.<br />
        Behind my nights I see God's finger trace<br />
        A Nightmare multiform yet never-ending.</p>
<p>        I dread my sleep like some enormous hole<br />
        Full of vague horror, leading to no goal.<br />
        All windows bare the infinite to me.</p>
<p>        My soul, in its vertiginous endeavour,<br />
        Envies the senseless void--Ah, never never<br />
        From entities or numbers to be free!</p>
<p>                                   IX</p>
<p>                        _Complaint of an Icarus_</p>
<p>        Those who love whores are well-endowed,<br />
        Spry, and well-fed, and cheerful-spoken.<br />
        But, as for me, my arms are broken<br />
        From trying to embrace a cloud.</p>
<p>        To what two peerless stars have done<br />
        That kindle in the farthest skies,<br />
        I owe it that my burnt-out eyes<br />
        Know only memories of the sun.</p>
<p>        In vain I've tried to find the pole<br />
        And the equator-line of space.<br />
        I know not by what burning gaze<br />
        The wings were molten from my soul.</p>
<p>        By love of beauty singed, I fall<br />
        Yet fail the honour and the bliss<br />
        To give my name to the abyss<br />
        Which serves me for my tomb and pall.</p>
<p>                                   X</p>
<p>                               _The Lid_</p>
<p>        Wherever Man may go, by earth or ocean,<br />
        Beneath a sky of fire, or sun snow-cold,<br />
        Whether to Christ or Venus his devotion,<br />
        In gloomy want, or glittering with gold;</p>
<p>        Citizen, vagabond, stamplicker, farmer,<br />
        Be his small brain slow-witted, quick, or sly,<br />
        For this strange terror he can find no armour<br />
        Nor look to heaven save with trembling eye.</p>
<p>        Above, the Sky, that cellar-ceiling, stifles,<br />
        Lit up for comic farce, where struts and trifles<br />
        Each mummer on a floor of blood and mire.</p>
<p>        Terror of rakes, the crazy hermits' hope--<br />
        Beneath its cauldron-lid mankind must grope,<br />
        Never above its margin to aspire.</p>

<p>                                   XI</p>
<p>                             _Pagan Prayer_</p>
<p>        Don't stint the fires with which you flare.<br />
        Warm up my dull heart to delight,<br />
        O Pleasure, torture of the sprite,<br />
        O Goddess, hear my fervent prayer!</p>
<p>        Goddess, who through the ether pass,<br />
        Flame in this subterranean hole!<br />
        Raise up a chilled and stricken soul<br />
        Who lifts to you his peal of brass.</p>
<p>        O Pleasure, always be my queen!<br />
        In flesh and velvet to be seen,<br />
        Mask your beauty like a siren:</p>
<p>        Or else my soul with sleep environ<br />
        Drained from the formless mystic wine,<br />
        Elastic phantom! which is thine.</p>
<p>                                  XII</p>
<p>                          _The Moon Offended_</p>
<p>        O moon, to whom our fathers used to pray,<br />
        From your blue home, where, odalisques of light,<br />
        The stars will follow you in spruce array,<br />
        Old Cynthia, lantern of our dens by night,</p>
<p>        Do you see sleeping lovers on their couches<br />
        Reveal the cool enamel of their teeth:<br />
        The poet at his labours, how he crouches:<br />
        And vipers--how they couple on the heath?</p>
<p>        In yellow domino, with stealthy paces,<br />
        Do you yet steal with clandestine embraces<br />
        To clasp Endymion's pale, millenial charm?</p>
<p>        --"I see your mother, by her mirror, buckled<br />
        By weight of years, poor child of death and harm!<br />
        Patching with art the breast at which you suckled!"</p>
<p>                                  XIII</p>
<p>                    _To ThÃ©odore de Banville, 1842_</p>
<p>        Your hands have seized the goddess by the hair<br />
        In such a grasp, so finally and fully,<br />
        One thinks of some Herculean young Bully<br />
        Flooring his mistress with a lordly air.</p>
<p>        With clear eyes radiant with precocious fire,<br />
        You've shown such pride in architecture fine<br />
        And such a pure audacity of line--<br />
        One knows to what your manhood will aspire.</p>
<p>        Poet! Our blood, through every pore outpressed,<br />
        Escapes from us as if the Centaur's vest<br />
        Made a funereal rill of every vein;</p>
<p>        One thinks that vest was dyed in vengeful spittle<br />
        Of the two snakes that Hercules, when little,<br />
        Throttled in his two fists till they were slain.</p>
<p>                               CONCLUSION</p>
<p>                            _The Unforeseen_</p>
<p>        Harpagon watched his father slowly dying<br />
        And musing on his white lips as they shrunk,<br />
        Said, "There is lumber in the outhouse lying<br />
        It seems: old boards and junk."</p>
<p>        Celimene cooed, and said, "How good I am<br />
        And, naturally, God made my looks excell"<br />
        (Her callous heart, thrice-smoked like salted ham,<br />
        Will burn in endless Hell!)</p>
<p>        A smoky scribbler, to himself a beacon,<br />
        Says to the wretch whom he has plunged in shade--<br />
        "Where's the Creator you so loved to speak on,<br />
        The Saviour you portrayed?"</p>
<p>        But best of all I know a certain rogue<br />
        Who yawns and weeps, lamenting night and day<br />
        (Impotent fathead) in the same old brogue,<br />
        "I will be good--one day!"</p>
<p>        The clock says in a whisper, "He is ready<br />
        The damned one, whom I warned of his disaster.<br />
        He's blind, and deaf, and like a wall unsteady,<br />
        Where termites mine the plaster".</p>
<p>        Then one appeared whom all of them denied<br />
        And said with mocking laughter "To my manger<br />
        You've _all_ come; to the Black Mass I provide<br />
        Not one of you's a stranger.</p>
<p>        You've built me temples in your hearts of sin.<br />
        You've kissed my buttocks in your secret mirth.<br />
        Know me for Satan by this conquering grin,<br />
        As monstrous as the Earth.</p>
<p>        D'you think, poor hypocrites surprised red-handed,<br />
        That you can trick your lord without a hitch;<br />
        And that by guile two prizes can be landed--<br />
        Heaven, and being rich?</p>
<p>        The wages of the huntsman is his quarry,<br />
        Which pays him for the chills he gets while stalking.<br />
        Companions of my revels grim and sorry<br />
        I am going to take you walking,</p>
<p>        Down through the denseness of the soil and rock,<br />
        Down through the dust and ash you leave behind,<br />
        Into a palace, built in one sole block,<br />
        Of stone that is not kind:</p>
<p>        For it is built of Universal Sin<br />
        And holds of me all that is proud and glorious".<br />
        --Meanwhile an angel, far above the din,<br />
        Sends forth a peal victorious</p>
<p>        For all whose hearts can say, "I bless thy rod;<br />
        And blessÃ¨d be the griefs that on us fall.<br />
        My soul is but a toy, Eternal God,<br />
        Thy wisdom all in all!"</p>
<p>        And so deliciously that trumpet blows<br />
        On evenings of celestial harvestings,<br />
        It makes a rapture in the hearts of those<br />
        Whose love and praise it sings.</p>

<blockquote>Learning that his wife had been conducting a passionate affair with Vita (to the enraged jealousy of Vitaâs other lover, Virginia Woolf), Campbell began to see the three aspects of the new elite --sexual inversion, anti-patriotism, and progressive politics -- as aspects of a single frame of mind. These three qualities amounted, for Campbell, to a refusal to grow up. The new elite, in Campbellâs opinion, lived as bloodless parasites on their social inferiors and moral betters; they jettisoned real responsibilities in favor of utopian fantasies and flattered themselves that their precious sensibilities were signs of moral refinement, rather than the marks of a fastidious narcissism. The role of the poet is not to join their Peter Pan games but to look beneath such frolics for the source of spiritual renewal.</p></blockquote>
