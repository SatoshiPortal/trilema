		<description>I'm not likely to ever stop, but film reviews are some of the more cost-intensive Trilema pieces : I have to first watch a film I give enough of a shit about to write one, and I don't dedicate my life to cinema. Since the production is drastically limited in this way, you will definitely reach the end of the pile if you binge ; then again I have the advantage of diligence applied over lengthy intervals, so the pile is pretty hefty to begin with.</description>

		<description>I have been reading the film reviews on here from http://trilema.com/category/trilematograf/ I swear to god they're more interesting than watching the films. Like I have three things downloaded already but I'm just binge reading more reviews. Please never stop.</description>
