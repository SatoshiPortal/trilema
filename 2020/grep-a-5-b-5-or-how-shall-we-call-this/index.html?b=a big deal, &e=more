Don't you find it delightful, by the way, having one girl prepare the rod for another ? What's more lovingly sisterly womanly perfectly etcetera ? All sort and manner of deep social practice, voiced for instance as `Make it really big and hard, so it hurts her` becomes meaningful let alone possible in this way, it's just... It's how it was meant to be, what can I say. In practice you can always tell, and I am telling : this is how it was ever meant to work, the whole complex machinery finally makes sense, not part by part and in its parts, but whole.">i</a></sup>"</p>
<p>In lieu of the self-obvious continuing *slurp* I'ma go serve myself some spinach lamb curry -- I think maybe the spinach curry is called ghost something in its original appelation<sup><a href="#footnote_1_96741" id="identifier_1_96741" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Many years ago, back when I was still wee tyke-y enough to read `science fiction` seriously, I recall encountering for the first time the concept of `matter replicator`, a most lazy writing device of auctorial convenience.

For all you know matter replicators already exist, commonly dispersed in the immediate environment, but since you don't manage to communicate Platonic notions...
Anyways, I've built something quite like it, myself. You see, when you take some inane blondy to a thousand-dollar a plate restaurant as part of your simpy worship, she'll maybe give you a blowjob later, right ? Maybe though, her choice, right, you wouldn't think of forcing her or anything. Isn't that right ? Well... I force mine, of course I do, occasionally so excitedly force them they nosepuke on my pubic hair for which physiological act of disobedience they get harshly punished, on top of just how fucking painful it is to have stomach acid in your sinuses. But the blowjob ain't the point : when I take mine to the restaurant, they pay the fuck attention ; and then later they... reproduce what they saw. The cost to me of infinity is one trial and the ingredients, the first thousand bucks buys me the first plate, and the next thousand bucks the next -- however many -- other plates.
It is, I tell you true, the only way to live.

So...">ii</a></sup> ? -- and be right back to continue our mutual exposee... exposition... exhibition, how do you call what we jointly do, anyway ? Where I show you myself, as I am, meaning a presence, while you equally show me yourself, but as you are : as an absence. As an impotence, as an... I show you my whores and you show me your sores, I show my wholes, pulsing, rock-hard while you show your holes, aching, desperate... it's mutual, of course it is, every action always has a reaction and hey, ever noticed that epitaph up front ? The one that goes</p>
<blockquote><p>Mentula cum doleat imperio, tibi, lector, culus.<br />
Non sum diuinus, sed scio quid facias. </p></blockquote>
<p>Did you ever figure out what it means ? Because it's quite relevant here : in your pain we distinguish what our joint activity consists of, and how it'd be classified, you know ? And with it goes the required, self-obvious conclusion : <em>ma doare-n pula de voi, dragii mei</em>. </p>
