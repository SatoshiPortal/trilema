The world's 50 most powerful blogs</p>
<p>From Prince Harry in Afghanistan to Tom Cruise ranting about Scientology and footage from the Burmese uprising, blogging has never been bigger. It can help elect presidents and take down attorney generals while simultaneously celebrating the minutiae of our everyday obsessions. Here are the 50 best reasons to log on<sup><a href="#footnote_4_95298" id="identifier_4_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Because, you see, `internet` as in web access wasn't always this always-on, by default thing. People used to have to log on [into their dial-up accounts], though in fairness that was all long passed at the time this piece was penned, the echo in there mere carry-over, like the word `cool` spoken by today's consummate squares, for instance.">v</a></sup></p>
<p>1. The Huffington Post (huffingtonpost.com)</p>
<p>The history of political blogging might usefully be divided into the periods pre- and post-Huffington. Before the millionaire socialite<sup><a href="#footnote_5_95298" id="identifier_5_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="More like Pantsuited Hilarity lite, chick was the wife of some dude who tried and failed to get into the US Senate in the 90s (dude meanwhile became gay ; they divorced).">vi</a></sup> Arianna Huffington decided to get in on the act, bloggers operated in a spirit of underdog solidarity. They hated the mainstream media - and the feeling was mutual.<sup><a href="#footnote_6_95298" id="identifier_6_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Or rather, some remnant of `mainstream` media still yet stood, somewhat, back then.">vii</a></sup></p>
<p>Bloggers saw themselves as gadflies, pricking the arrogance of established elites<sup><a href="#footnote_7_95298" id="identifier_7_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Self-`established`, rather.">viii</a></sup> from their home computers, in their pyjamas, late into the night. So when, in 2005, Huffington decided to mobilise her fortune and media connections to create, from scratch, a flagship liberal blog she was roundly derided. Who, spluttered the original bloggerati, did she think she was?</p>
<p>But the pyjama purists were confounded. Arianna's money talked just as loudly online as off, and the Huffington Post quickly became one of the most influential and popular journals on the web. It recruited professional columnists and celebrity bloggers. It hoovered up traffic. Its launch was a landmark moment in the evolution of the web because it showed that many of the old rules still applied to the new medium: a bit of marketing savvy and deep pockets could go just as far as geek credibility, and get there faster.<sup><a href="#footnote_8_95298" id="identifier_8_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Indeed it got exactly there : `sold` for a third of a billion to AOL (versus Murdoch's full billion), it exists no longer.">ix</a></sup></p>
<p>To borrow the gold-rush simile beloved of web pioneers<sup><a href="#footnote_9_95298" id="identifier_9_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Oh, you thought `the dao` invented that ? I doge you did!">x</a></sup>, Huffington's success made the first generation of bloggers look like two-bit prospectors panning for nuggets in shallow creeks before the big mining operations moved in. In the era pre-Huffington, big media companies ignored the web, or feared it; post-Huffington they started to treat it as just another marketplace, open to exploitation. Three years on, Rupert Murdoch owns MySpace, while newbie amateur bloggers have to gather traffic crumbs from under the table of the big-time publishers.<sup><a href="#footnote_10_95298" id="identifier_10_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Right ?">xi</a></sup></p>
<p>Least likely to post 'I'm so over this story - check out the New York Times'</p>
<p>2. Boing Boing (boingboing.net)</p>
<p>Lego reconstructions of pop videos and cakes baked in the shape of iPods are not generally considered relevant to serious political debate. But even the most earnest bloggers will often take time out of their busy schedule to pass on some titbit of mildly entertaining geek ephemera. No one has done more to promote pointless, yet strangely cool, time-wasting stuff on the net than the editors<sup><a href="#footnote_11_95298" id="identifier_11_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Which is the problem with these `blogs` : they very much aren't. Every list of `top blogs` out there readily produces lists of not-blogs, like so : 

Drudge's thing was arguably maybe still a blog (though pushing things to breaking point) ; but these sad aglomerations of nothing in particular are absolutely not blogs, nor anything like blogs. They're pompous forums, perhaps, they're aggregations of unimportant opinions, they're the herd trying to survive through herding, in its usual fashion. Whatever they may be, blogs, however, they are not ; nor ever could be.">xii</a></sup> of Boing Boing (subtitle: A Directory of Wonderful Things). It launched in January 2000 and has had an immeasurable influence on the style and idiom of blogging.<sup><a href="#footnote_12_95298" id="identifier_12_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="It's basically the thing cracked.com copied, more or less ; in turn it being a pale copy (muchly admixed with lotta cheap cutting agent) of an (anonymous) blog of the 90s called rotten.com.">xiii</a></sup> But hidden among the pictures of steam-powered CD players and Darth Vader tea towels there is a steely, ultra-liberal political agenda: championing the web as a global medium free of state and corporate control.<sup><a href="#footnote_13_95298" id="identifier_13_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This is entirely not liberal, but rather the opposite ; for some reason at the time the `liberal` (ie, pantsuit) interest groups were peaking in their influence on (and capture of) statal (corporate, academic, etcetera) institutions, pantsuitism also mendaciously misrepresented itself as `outsiders` (or rather -- desperately clung to the misrepresentation, whatever). Needless to say the pantsuits hadn't been outsiders since at least the Clinton colonels coup, up until at most Hilary's public rape. They had a good two decades, basically. It's something, or at the very least it'll still seem like something for a decade or two.
Back to the point : freedom from statal-whatever blather, in all its forms, is the fundamental argument of the US Confederacy, and in general the fundament of closed society. It's the state (of idiots) versus the people (that matter) ; and always so it will be.">xiv</a></sup></p>
<p>Boing Boing chronicles cases where despotic regimes have silenced or imprisoned bloggers. It helped channel blogger scorn on to Yahoo and Google when they kowtowed to China's censors in order to win investment opportunities.<sup><a href="#footnote_14_95298" id="identifier_14_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="You know ?">xv</a></sup> It was instrumental in exposing the creeping erosion of civil liberties in the US under post-9/11 'Homeland Security' legislation. And it routinely ridicules attempts by the music and film industries to persecute small-time file sharers and bedroom pirates instead of getting their own web strategies in order. It does it all with gentle, irreverent charm, polluted only occasionally with gratuitous smut.</p>
<p>Their dominance of the terrain where technology meets politics makes the Boing Boing crew geek aristocracy.</p>

It's true, what can I do, there's not that many kinds of scams because there's not that many kinds of idiots, it's the way of the world.">xvi</a></sup></p>
<p>3. Techcrunch (techcrunch.com)</p>
<p>Techcrunch began in 2005 as a blog about dotcom start-ups in Silicon Valley, but has quickly become one of the most influential news websites across the entire technology industry.<sup><a href="#footnote_16_95298" id="identifier_16_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Or rather : the principal equivalent of bitcointards.com in the (comparatively smaller, and less relevant) `web` space (though they prefer to pompously call their spurious collection of worthless websites `technology`, no fucking idea why).

Funny, huh ?">xvii</a></sup> Founder Michael Arrington had lived through the internet goldrush as a lawyer and entrepreneur before deciding that writing about new companies was more of an opportunity<sup><a href="#footnote_17_95298" id="identifier_17_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The way he eneded up is perhaps more instructive, for the `student of human moves`.">xviii</a></sup> than starting them himself. His site is now ranked the third-most popular blog in the world by search engine Technorati<sup><a href="#footnote_18_95298" id="identifier_18_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Remember that ? No, it doesn't exist anymore, of course not.">xix</a></sup>, spawning a mini-empire of websites and conferences as a result. Business Week named Arrington one of the 25 most influential<sup><a href="#footnote_19_95298" id="identifier_19_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Do you ever wonder who the fuck were the other 24 ?

<p>With a horde of hungry geeks and big money investors online, Techcrunch is the largest of a wave of technology-focused blog publishers to tap into the market - GigaOm<sup><a href="#footnote_20_95298" id="identifier_20_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Went bankrupt somewhat recently, it was a pretty lulzy moment.">xxi</a></sup>, PaidContent and Mashable among them - but often proves more contentious than its rivals, thanks to Arrington's aggressive relationships with traditional media and his conflicts of interest as an investor himself.</p>
<p>Least likely to post 'YouTube? It'll never catch on'</p>
<p>4. Kottke (kottke.org)</p>
<p>One of the early wave of blogging pioneers, web designer Jason Kottke started keeping track of interesting things on the internet as far back as 1998. The site took off, boosted partly through close links to popular blog-building website Blogger<sup><a href="#footnote_21_95298" id="identifier_21_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Keks. 
Shit's still online, too ; though everyone long stopped giving a shit. And blogger was `bought`, and so on.">xxii</a></sup> (he later married one of the founders). And as the phenomenon grew quickly, Kottke became a well-known filter for surfers on the lookout for interesting reading.</p>
<p>Kottke remains one of the purest old-skool bloggers on the block - it's a selection of links to websites and articles rather than a repository for detailed personal opinion<sup><a href="#footnote_22_95298" id="identifier_22_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="One of the purest old-skool bloggers on the block in not being a blogger at all, but an aggregator. Hurr.">xxiii</a></sup> - and although it remains fairly esoteric, his favourite topics include film, science, graphic design and sport. He often picks up trends and happenings before friends start forwarding them to your inbox. Kottke's decision to consciously avoid politics could be part of his appeal (he declares himself 'not a fan'), particularly since the blog's voice is literate, sober and inquiring, unlike much of the red-faced ranting found elsewhere online.</p>
<p>A couple of key moments boosted Kottke's fame: first, being threatened with legal action by Sony for breaking news about a TV show, but most notably quitting his web-design job and going solo three years ago. A host of 'micropatrons' and readers donated cash to cover his salary, but these days he gets enough advertising to pay the bills. He continues to plug away at the site as it enters its 10th year.</p>
<p>Least likely to post 'Look at this well wicked vid of a dog on a skateboard'</p>
<p>5. Dooce (dooce.com)</p>
<p>One of the best-known personal bloggers<sup><a href="#footnote_23_95298" id="identifier_23_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Blessfully long dead ; was one of those insufferable twats pretending they're important because they exist and hoping nobody ever summons up the guts to publicly say their small children are fugly. Maddox made a living for a few years by mocking online that sort of Karen then only found offline ; later the Karens found the online and started karening there, though in fact the first Karen was Heather-whatever (name keeps changing).
Still technically online, though absolutely nobody was there this year. I suppose that circumstance will change now, and for a few months or whatever...">xxiv</a></sup> (those who provide more of a diary than a soapbox or reporting service), Heather Armstrong has been writing online since 2001. Though there were personal websites that came before hers, certain elements conspired to make Dooce one of the biggest public diaries since Samuel Pepys's<sup><a href="#footnote_24_95298" id="identifier_24_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Exageration is one thing, but go and read a few pages of each and see for yourself.">xxv</a></sup>. Primarily, Armstrong became one of the first high-profile cases of somebody being fired for writing about her job. After describing events that her employer - a dotcom start-up - thought reflected badly on them, Armstrong was sacked. The incident caused such fierce debate that Dooce found itself turned into a verb that is used in popular parlance (often without users realising its evolution): 'dooced - to be fired from one's job as a direct result of one's personal website'.</p>
<p>Behind Dooce stands an army of personal bloggers perhaps not directly influenced by, or even aware of, her work - she represents the hundreds of thousands who decide to share part of their life with strangers.</p>
<p>Armstrong's honesty has added to her popularity, and she has written about work, family life, postnatal depression, motherhood, puppies and her Mormon upbringing with the same candid and engaging voice. Readers feel that they have been brought into her life, and reward her with their loyalty. Since 2005 the advertising revenue on her blog alone has been enough to support her family.</p>
<p>Least likely to post 'I like babies but I couldn't eat a whole one'</p>
<p>6. Perezhilton (perezhilton.com)</p>
<p>Once dubbed 'Hollywood's most hated website', Perezhilton (authored by Mario Lavandeira since 2005) is the gossip site celebrities fear most. Mario, 29, is famous for scrawling rude things (typically doodles about drug use) over pap photos and outing closeted stars. On the day of Lindsay Lohan's arrest for drink-driving, he posted 60 updates, and 8m readers logged on.<sup><a href="#footnote_25_95298" id="identifier_25_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="At least did, back when faggots were still cool.">xxvi</a></sup></p>
<p>He's a shameless publicity whore, too. His reality show premiered on VH1 last year, and his blogsite is peppered with snaps of him cuddling Paris Hilton at premieres. Fergie from Black Eyed Peas alluded to him in a song, and Avril Lavigne phoned<sup><a href="#footnote_26_95298" id="identifier_26_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Avril Lavigne!!!!

<p>7. Talking points memo (talkingpointsmemo.com)</p>
<p>At some point during the disputed US election of 2000 - when Al Gore was famously defeated by a few hanging chads - Joshua Micah Marshall lost patience. Despite working as a magazine editor, Marshall chose to vent on the web. Eight years later Talking Points Memo and its three siblings draw in more than 400,000 viewers a day from their base in New York.</p>
<p>Marshall has forged a reputation<sup><a href="#footnote_27_95298" id="identifier_27_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Anyone ever heard of Marshall ? No ? 
But what a surprise.">xxviii</a></sup>, and now makes enough money to run a small team of reporters who have made an impact by sniffing out political scandal and conspiracy. 'I think in many cases the reporting we do is more honest, more straight than a lot of things you see even on the front pages of great papers like the New York Times and the Washington Post,' he said in an interview last year. 'But I think both kinds of journalism should exist, should co-exist.'</p>
<p>Although his unabashed partisan approach is admonished by many old-fashioned American reporters, Marshall's skills at pulling together the threads of a story have paid dividends. Last year he helped set the agenda after George Bush covertly fired a string of US attorneys deemed disloyal to the White House. While respected mainstream media figures accused Marshall of seeing conspiracy, he kept digging: the result was the resignation of attorney general Alberto Gonzales, and a prestigious George Polk journalism award for Marshall, the first ever for a blogger.</p>

<p>8. Icanhascheezburger (icanhascheezburger.com)</p>
<p>Amused by a photo of a smiling cat, idiosyncratically captioned with the query 'I Can Has A Cheezburger?', which he found on the internet while between jobs in early 2007, Eric Nakagawa of Hawaii emailed a copy of it to a friend (known now only as Tofuburger). Then, on a whim, they began a website, first comprising only that one captioned photo<sup><a href="#footnote_28_95298" id="identifier_28_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Which they hadn't either taken or captioned.">xxix</a></sup> but which has since grown into one of the most popular blogs in the world.<sup><a href="#footnote_29_95298" id="identifier_29_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Really, it's meanwhile grown into the entire web. What else is there ?">xxx</a></sup></p>
<p>Millions of visitors visit Icanhascheezburger.com to see, create, submit and vote on Lolcats (captioned photos of characterful cats in different settings). The 'language' used in the captions, which this blog has helped to spread globally, is known as Lolspeak, aka Kitty Pidgin. In Lolspeak, human becomes 'hooman', Sunday 'bunday', exactly 'xackly' and asthma 'azma'. There is now an effort to develop a LOLCode computer-programming language<sup><a href="#footnote_30_95298" id="identifier_30_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Meanwhile it became Unicode, a genuine systems language in and of and by itself.">xxxi</a></sup> and another to translate the Bible into Lolspeak.</p>

<p>9. Beppe Grillo (beppegrillo.it)</p>
<p>Among the most visited blogs in the world is that of Beppe Grillo, a popular Italian comedian and political commentator, long persona non grata on state TV, who is infuriated daily - especially by corruption and financial scandal in his country.<sup><a href="#footnote_31_95298" id="identifier_31_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The only pantsuit agenda for foreign spaces.">xxxii</a></sup></p>
<p>A typical blog by Grillo calls, satirically or otherwise, for the people of Naples and Campania to declare independence, requests that Germany declare war on Italy to help its people ('We will throw violets and mimosa to your Franz and Gunther as they march through') or reports on Grillo's ongoing campaign to introduce a Bill of Popular Initiative to remove from office all members of the Italian parliament who've ever had a criminal conviction. Grillo's name for Mario Mastella, leader of the Popular-UDEUR centre-right party, is Psychodwarf.<sup><a href="#footnote_32_95298" id="identifier_32_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="There's a lot of lulz re Berlusconi in there, as a lizzard.">xxxiii</a></sup> 'In another country, he would have been the dishwasher in a pizzeria,' says Grillo. Through his blog, he rallied many marchers in 280 Italian towns and cities for his 'Fuck You' Day last September.</p>

<p>10. Gawker (gawker.com)</p>
<p>A New York blog of 'snarky' gossip and commentary about the media industry, Gawker was founded in 2002 by journalist Nick Denton, who had previously helped set up a networking site called First Tuesday for web and media entrepreneurs. Gawker's earliest fascination was gossip about Vogue editor Anna Wintour, garnered from underlings at Conde Nast. This set the tone for amassing a readership of movers and shakers on the Upper East Side<sup><a href="#footnote_33_95298" id="identifier_33_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="`Disgruntled if overcompensated good for nothings nobody could be bothered to fuck for pay` would have been more accurate ; though of course accuracy being a representational virtue, it can't possibly ever be the point for the aspie class.">xxxiv</a></sup>, as well as 'the angry creative underclass' wishing either to be, or not be, like them, or both ('the charmingly incompetent X... the wildly successful blowhard'). Within a year Gawker's readers were making 500,000 page views per month. Nowadays the figure is 11m, recovering from a recent dip to 8m thanks to the showing of a Tom Cruise 'Indoctrination Video' which Scientologists had legally persuaded YouTube to take down. Gawker remains the flagship of Gawker Media, which now comprises 14 blogs, although gossiping by ex-Gawker insiders, a fixation on clicks (which its bloggers are now paid on the basis of) and fresh anxiety over defining itself have led some to claim Gawker has become more 'tabloidy' and celeb- and It-girl-orientated<sup><a href="#footnote_34_95298" id="identifier_34_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="In case you don't know, which you don't, the `It girl` was how Brits called economically worthless females on sale, the Diana Guresoaies of this world.

She blogs in an uncontroversial but quite reflective manner, aiming to show a 'real person' behind the celebrity. Each posting, usually ending with 'I have to be up early' or a promise to report tomorrow on a DVD she is watching, is followed by many hundreds of comments from readers -- affirming their love, offering advice, insisting she take care.

<p>Treehugger is a green consumer blog with a mission to bring a sustainable lifestyle to the masses. Its ethos, that a green lifestyle does not have to mean sacrifice, and its positive, upbeat feel have attracted over 1.8m unique users a month. Consistently ranked among the top 20 blogs on Technorati, Treehugger has 10 staff but also boasts 40 writers from a wide variety of backgrounds in more than 10 countries around the world, who generate more than 30 new posts a day across eight categories, ranging from fashion and beauty, travel and nature, to science and technology. Treehugger began as an MBA class project four years ago and says it now generates enough revenue from sponsorship and advertising to pay all its staffers and writers. It has developed a highly engaged community and has added popular services like TreeHugger.tv, and a user-generated blog, Hugg.

It is run by Alvy, Nacho and Wicho, three friends in Madrid, who blog in Spanish. The second most popular blog in Europe and the 13th most popular in the world (according to eBizMBA), Microsiervos concerns itself with science, curiosities, strange reality, chance, games, puzzles, quotations, conspiracies, computers, hacking, graffiti and design.

<p>You want relentless celebrity gossip on tap? TMZ will provide it, and when we say relentless, we mean relentless. The US site is dripping with 'breaking news' stories, pictures and videos, and deems celeb activity as mundane as stars walking to their cars worthy of a video post.

<p>As ideas go, this one is pretty simple. Man wanders around Manhattan with a camera. Spots someone whose outfit he likes. Asks if he can take a picture. Goes home and posts it on his blog. But the man in question is Scott Schuman, who had 15 years' experience working at the high-fashion end of the clothing industry before starting The Sartorialist. He's got a sharp eye for a good look, a gift for grabbing an on-the-hoof pic and an unwavering enthusiasm for people going the extra mile in the name of style.

'SFT plans to stage protests in Beijing during the games and post blogs as events unfold,' says Iain Thom, the SFT UK national co-ordinator. 'But for security reasons we can't reveal details of how or where yet.' Similarly, a massive protest in London on 10 March will be the subject of intense cyber comment.

<p>With a title pulled from Immanuel Kant's famous statement that 'out of the crooked timber of humanity, no straight thing was ever made', it's an amalgam of academic and political writing that has muscled its way into the epicentre of intelligent discussion since its conception in 2003. Formed as an internet supergroup, pulling several popular intellectual blogs together, Crooked Timber now has 16 members -- largely academics -- across the US, Europe, Australia and Asia. The site has built itself a reputation as something of an intellectual powerhouse; a sort of global philosophical thinktank conducted via blog.<sup><a href="#footnote_66_95298" id="identifier_66_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Still ongoing, after a fashion, except now they're quoting Krugman while wearing face masks (and being much less read than a decade ago -- in fact it's altogether dubious anyone besides the immediate family of the participants spends any time on the site).

<p>34. Beansprouts (bean-sprouts.blogspot.com)</p>
<p>Combining diary, opinion and green lifestyle tips, Beansprouts is a blog that covers one family's 'search for the good life'. Melanie Rimmer and her family of five live in a 'small ex-council house' with a garden on the edge of farmland in Poynton, Cheshire. They grow food on an allotment nearby, keep chickens and bees and 'try to be green, whatever that means'. Rimmer set up the blog nearly two years ago when she first got the allotment and says she felt it was something worth writing about. With one post a day, often more, topics for discussion can range from top 10 uses for apples to making scrap quilts.<sup><a href="#footnote_67_95298" id="identifier_67_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Dead in 2010, if you don't count a solitary 2012 offering, consisting of a youtube embed.">lxviii</a></sup></p>

<p>Launched by 'Bob' after the success of his WorldCupBlog in 2006, Offside is a UK-based blog covering football leagues globally, gathering news and visuals on all of it, inviting countless match reports and promoting discussion on all things soccer, from the attack by a colony of red ants on a player in the Sao Paulo state championship third division, to the particular qualities of every one of Cristiano Ronaldo's goals so far this season. Considered by many to be the best 'serious' blog in the game, it nevertheless promises irreverently, 'If there is a sex scandal in England, we'll be stuck in the middle of it.

<p>36. Peteite Anglaise (petiteanglaise.com)</p>
<p>The tagline of a new book hitting British shelves reads 'In Paris, in love, in trouble', but if it were telling the whole story, perhaps it should read 'In public' too. Bored at work one day in 2004, expat secretary Catherine Sanderson happened upon the concept of blogging. With a few clicks and an impulse she created her own blog, and quickly gathered fans who followed her life in Paris, the strained relationship with her partner and adventures with her toddler. And there was plenty of drama to watch<sup><a href="#footnote_69_95298" id="identifier_69_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="But of course, stories of secretaries and their toddlers. Gimme a fucking break.">lxx</a></sup>: within a year her relationship had broken up, and she'd met a new man who wooed her online. Readers were mesmerised by her unflinching dedication to telling the whole story, no matter how she would be judged. Soon afterwards, however, Sanderson's employers found out about the blog and promptly fired her. Defeat turned into victory, however, with the press attention she gathered from the dismissal not only securing victory in an industrial tribunal, but also helping her score a lucrative two-book deal with Penguin.</p>

<p>37. Crooks and liars (crooksandliars.com)</p>
<p>Founded in 2004 by John Amato (a professional saxophonist and flautist), Crooks and Liars is a progressive/liberal-leaning political blog, with over 200m visitors to date, which is illustrated by video and audio clips of politicians and commentators on podiums, radio and TV. Readers post a variety of comments on political talking points of the day, although 9/11 conspiracy theories are often deleted, and there is a daily round-up of notable stories on other political blogs.</p>

<p>38. Chocolate and Zucchini (chocolateandzucchini.com)</p>
<p>For Clothilde Dusoulier, a young woman working in computing and living in the Paris district of Montmartre, starting a blog was a way of venting her boundless enthusiasm for food without worrying she might be boring her friends with it. Five years later Chocolate and Zucchini, one of the most popular cooking blogs, has moved from being a hobby to a full-time career. The mixture of an insider's view on gastronomic Paris, conversational, bilingual writing and the sheer irresistibility of her recipes pull in thousands of readers every day. This, in turn, has led to multiple books and the ability to forge a dream career as a food writer.The name of the blog is, she says, a good metaphor for her cooking style: 'The zucchini illustrates my focus on healthy and natural eating... and the chocolate represents my decidedly marked taste for anything sweet.'</p>

Samizdata serves its opinions up strong and neat, but still recognisable as politics. On the other side of the border, in the wilderness, the real nutters start.</p>

<p>Andrew Sullivan is an expat Brit, blogging pioneer and defier-in-chief of American political stereotypes.

Barack Obama is his preferred Democrat candidate in 2008. So he is either confused, a hypocrite or a champion of honest non-partisanship -- depending on your point of view.

<p>42. Jonny B's private secret diary (privatesecretdiary.com)</p>
<p>Growing in popularity since its debut in 2003, Jonny B's diary -- which is clearly neither private nor terribly secret -- catalogues the rock and bowls lifestyle of one man in the depths of rural Norfolk.

As a slow, gentle satire on modern village life, it is often held up as an example of blog as sitcom, and has not only attracted a loyal band of readers, but a dedicated fan club on Facebook desperate to work out the real identity of the wit behind the site. Previous guesses have included Chris Evans and Johnny Vaughan, though both have been strenuously denied.</p>

<p>44. Waiter rant (waiterrant.net)</p>
<p>Rant isn't quite the right word for this collection of carefully crafted stories from the sharp end of the service industry in a busy New York restaurant. 'The Waiter', as the author is known, has been blogging his experiences with fussy customers and bad tippers since 2004, winning a gong at blogging's biggest awards, the Bloggies, in 2007. It's representative -- but by no means the first -- of the so-called 'job-blogs', with people from all walks of life, from ambulance drivers (randomactsofreality.net) and policemen (coppersblog.blogspot.com) to the greatly loved but now defunct Call Centre Confidential. Between them they chronicle life in their trade, and usually from behind a veil of anonymity. Something about the everyday nature of The Waiter -- a person we like to pretend is invisible or treat with servile disdain -- deconstructing the event later with a subtle, erudite typestroke, has captured the public imagination and (hopefully) made some people behave better in restaurants than they otherwise might.<sup><a href="#footnote_76_95298" id="identifier_76_95298" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Da fuck nonsense is this !?

WoWinsider reports on what's happening within WoW ('Sun's Reach Harbor has been captured'). It also reports on outside developments and rumours ('A future patch will bring a new feature: threat meters').

She has never posted a photo of herself and this 'anonymity' has led recently to her having to fend off claims she's really a white man, even a drag queen.

						<p>Yo MP,</p>
<p>Have you come across Bronze Age Pervert? Vaguely reminiscent of The Last Psychiatrist, if Alone took shrooms on a tropical beach and had a harem of tanned angels rubbing coconut oil into his skin. And fantasized about Mitt Romney becoming a Greek warlord.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40388177-bronze-age-mindset">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40388177-bronze-age-mindset</a></p>
<p>"Some say that this book, found in a safebox in the port area of Kowloon, was dictated, because Bronze Age Pervert refuses to learn what he calls "the low and plebeian art of writing." It isn't known how this book was transcribed. The contents are pure dynamite. He explains that you live in ant farm. That you are observed by the lords of lies, ritually probed."</p>

<p>Neways, the dude sounds a lot more like <a href=http://trilema.com/2016/james-lafonds-beer-hooker-repaired/ >James Lafond</a>. Ballas went to college, where he did well ; these others are a very different demographic, the folks of Tin Men or Wall Street whatever or Glengarry Glen Ross, ambitious male hair salon <a href=http://trilema.com/2013/fried-chicken/?b=Vicki&#038;e=Marble#select>businesswomen</a>. Do you see what I mean ?</p>

						<p>I hadn't come across James Lafond before, cheers for the link. </p>
<p>Eh, I think I see what you're driving at, though Pervert is not really like a dude from Glengarry Glen Ross. I'm guessing the concept you define ostensively via your short list of examples is "wannabe alpha male who grew up consuming oestrogenated tap water, english-language-only education, etc", i.e., one who wants to be the toughest kid on the playground, but will still go back indoors the moment his female teachers ring the bell. BAP is kinda in the same category (as anyone who grew up in the anglo world is) but he's broken further out than most. I read a bunch of the guys often thrown into the vague categorization of "alt-right", and thought he was one of the few who had something original to say. Some quotes here: <a href="https://pastebin.com/rZRzeg6f">https://pastebin.com/rZRzeg6f</a></p>
<p>On that note, do you perchance have any writings you'd recommend (whether classical texts, soviet research papers,  leaked cia documents, niche romanian blogs, whatever)? I enjoyed the various adnotations in your archives so thought it'd be interesting to know if any writers out there have merited an MP seal of approval.</p>

						<blockquote><p>I'm guessing the concept you define ostensively via your short list of examples is "wannabe alpha male who grew up consuming oestrogenated tap water, english-language-only education, etc"</p></blockquote>
<p>I don't know the water enters into this (though I know <a href=http://trilema.com/2014/please-take-your-pills/ >who</a>'d like it to) ; but the ESL part is important, because indeed, the intellectual world is divided between those who are familiar with Latin and those who are familiar with copywriting. There's a difference between clerks and scholars ; even if the clerks were once "clerics" this difference is indelible ; and your guy's a clerk.</p>
<p>From where I stand, "<a href=http://trilema.com/2015/the-rabbi-and-the-ewe/ >the furthest a sheep ever went</a> towards the Torah" is not particularly interesting ; and the "without using the actual Torah or the actual tools of reading it, but only sticking to what a sheep's lot is on this earth" coda is not liable to breed any further interest. I have no idea what's your line, or if you even have one, but imagine Dali being introduced to quadriplegic kids who "drew", "<a href=http://trilema.com/2016/%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%88%D0%BD%D0%BE/?b=Noa,%20si%20asa&#038;e=nimica#select>as best as can be drawn</a> in their situation". Who the fuck cares about the cripples, seriously now ? Dali draws for real, not for fakesies, cvasies, pantsuities ; nor is any room in the world for "nobody could accuse them" failures.</p>
<p>As to the last point : Trilema itself is probably larger than the sum total of what anyone asking that question will ever read ; the process of actually reading it answers that question in and of itself : follow the leads you perceive as you perceive them, and if you're out start over reading -- because as the slavegirls unexceptionally discover, there's no such thing as an "already read" Trilema article, they shift and change from under you (meaning, you learn things). More generally the question's ill posed, if I have something to say I am going to say it through the extremely elaborate, unparalleledly effectual machinery I've already built for myself, to serve this exact purpose. It's the height of comedy to imagine that I had something stuck in my craw that I didn't know how to get out before you came asking, what the fuck, "all hail the anonymous nobody going 'hey MP, do you have anything to say ?' because check out the wonder of wonders, MP didn't think of saying it nor knew it could be said before". That's something reserved for the proles and the plebs, the faceless army of muzzle wearers, who don't think they can take it off until someone tells them to.</p>
