As that credit dwindles away the survival engine kicks on, and endures for as long as the "so what if we've got nothing, at least we're together" <a href=http://trilema.com/2018/oregon-represent/>girltalk</a> works. From experience it works variably in various times and places, in fact the only true, deep and authentic meaning of being white is "that dumb shit dun work <em>at all</em>". Everything else's Oriental at best, and generally African at its average, a point surprisingly close to worst.</p>
<p>I don't expect we'll see war, on the simple grounds that <a href="http://trilema.com/2016/the-next-generation/">the dreamers</a> are way the fuck too lazy and mentally disorganised for anything quite that effectual. They might be able to mostly "mobilize" to stay at home ; mobilization towards moving to any objective, definite point however... I do not believe there could be had, out of the endless millions currently zombying about decaying "first world" infrastructure, half as many extras as'd be required to re-enact just the Italian campaign in Greece for a year or two, let alone the whole scope of activities these schmucks' grandfathers engaged in over a decade. Excepting of course if by "war" you mean (like they no doubt will mean) "flying little plastic shits into other people's plastic shits most annoyingly", in which case... hell yeah! Nothing less than HDMI though, okay ?</p>
<p>Fun times, huh. I hope you're comfortable, because here's the thing with dark ages : as good as yesterday was ? That's as good as tomorrow'll ever get, and that in the best of cases. And for ye people of my own age, and of my own experience... welcome back, I guess ? Apparently burning down the shit ain't enough to burn down the shit, how the fuck this insanity works I don't know but evidently we hadn't ended it when we thought we ended it, we just somehow temporarily escaped a progressing front that meanwhile <a href="http://trilema.com/2009/sfarsitul-lumii/">caught up</a> again.
