<p>I opened my eyes. I saw glinting stars of dust whirling like a golden hurricane through a bright shaft of noon sun.<sup><a href="#footnote_0_97332" id="identifier_0_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This has got to be lifted from somewheres ; though I can't say I remember wheres.">i</a></sup> I looked through the open bedroom door. I saw the runt sitting at the living room window. She was doing her nails. She lifted her eyes from her nails. She looked into the bedroom.</p>
<p>I said, "Good morning, lil' freak puppy. I'm gonna call Silas to run across the street for ham and eggs. Are you hungry?"</p>
<p>She said, "Yeah, I'm hungry, but the way he moves around it would take him a week to cop. I'll slip on something and go myself."</p>
<p>She went to the closet and slipped on her blue poplin rain-or-shine coat. She took a fin off the dresser and held it up for my consent.<sup><a href="#footnote_1_97332" id="identifier_1_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Not bad, for a chick that's so far had her head banged and her belly punched. If only he threw her offa cliff or something she could probably pilot a Cessna. Who knows what electrocution could do.">ii</a></sup> I nodded my head. I heard the door shut when she went out.</p>
<p>I lit a cigarette. I thought, "I wonder if Melody has the heat looking for me. I've only got a day or so left before Glass Top takes me to Sweet Jones. I'm gonna cool it. I won't go out at all. I'll stay right here in the hotel until Top calls me."<sup><a href="#footnote_2_97332" id="identifier_2_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Not a bad idea, sadly, which is why lifetime criminals tend to develop a bit of a recluse streak to them. Sorta like monks.">iii</a></sup></p>
<p>The phone rang just as the runt came through the bedroom door. She put the plates wrapped in wax paper on the dresser. She picked up the receiver. I got up, took my plate and started to eat with a plastic fork.</p>
<p>She said, "Hello. Oh, Chuck, how are you, sweetie? I was just thinking about you, lover. No, I can't. I wish I could come out for a few drinks, but my brother won't be home from work until six. Mama's not well at all. I have to stay here during the day to take care of her. I could slip out around seven. Yeah, I could do that until eight for twenty. Bye, bye, sugar blue eyes."<sup><a href="#footnote_3_97332" id="identifier_3_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This is the largest part of her trade, by the way. Sure, `that ass of hers` ; but even when she'll be too old to have an ass at all they'll still call, provided she can still make up names for them they care about.
Wouldn't you like someone to call you sugga' blu-eyes, just like that ?">iv</a></sup></p>
<p>She hung up the phone and her coat. She sat naked on the side of the bed eating.<sup><a href="#footnote_4_97332" id="identifier_4_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Isn't this a darling scene ? Rather reminds me of my youth. How many times this played out, nude hussy hustlin' some square over the phone all the while smack drab in the middle of `the unthinkable` plainly occurring... nobody knows. Certainly no square knows.">v</a></sup></p>
<p>I said, "Bitch, I got an idea for that cat of yours. You gotta take a stiff brush and brush the hair straight down every time you think about it. Put some hair grower on it until you got maybe a four-inch cone. Your tricks will pant to bury their beaks in it. It will make your cat unique with that extra dimension."</p>
<p>She mumbled, "Where on Earth did you get a jazzy idea like that?"<sup><a href="#footnote_5_97332" id="identifier_5_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Janky more like it. Fancy that wonder, a century ago pubic wool on women was rather... stimulating.">vi</a></sup></p>
<p>I said, "Bitch, ain't you hip yet? I'm a pimp with great imagination, that's all."</p>
<p>She finished her flapjacks. She got up and gathered up an armful of our soiled clothing. She went into the bathroom. I heard the water sloshing in the bowl. She was doing our laundry.<sup><a href="#footnote_6_97332" id="identifier_6_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Can you believe this chick ?">vii</a></sup> I turned my back to the sunlight. I felt old Morpheus slugging his velvet hammer against my eyelids.</p>
<p>I woke up in darkness. I looked at the front-room window. The streetlights were on. I turned the nightstand lamp on. Mickey said seven-ten. The runt was gone. She was breaking her luck with Chuck.</p>
<p>I thought, "Jesus, I sure needed rest all right. That fast track I've been blundering on sure took the juice out of me."<sup><a href="#footnote_7_97332" id="identifier_7_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Well yeah, half a dozen `bangs` of `girl` definitely added a year and a half to his arteries. Which is ultimately the problem with cocaine.">viii</a></sup></p>
<p>I got up and went into the bathroom to brush my teeth. I had made several brush strokes when the phone rang. I picked it up. He rapped before I could open my mouth.</p>
<p>He said, "Kid, this is Glass Top. The plans have changed. I'm in a hurry. Be outside your joint in fifteen minutes. You got that?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yeah, but..."<sup><a href="#footnote_8_97332" id="identifier_8_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Really, `yeah.` is good enough. With the dot of a full stop at the end. Yeah.">ix</a></sup></p>
<p>He had hung up. I dressed even faster than I had at the sissy's pad. I rushed down the hall. I stopped at the broom-closet stash. I hurled the sizzle into the corner on the shelf. I took the stairs three at a time to the lobby. I sailed the key to the desk top. I bolted out the door.</p>
<p>Top was parked in front of the joint in the red Hog. He had his hand over the horn when he saw me.<sup><a href="#footnote_9_97332" id="identifier_9_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Sooo... are they gonna try for the .22 angle again ?">x</a></sup> I got in. The Hog squealed from the curb. Top was sure in a hurry. I could hear the harsh whisper of the Hog's tires against the pavement. We passed that neon bouquet. I looked back and saw the "Fun House" sign flashing. I wondered if Melody was out here somewhere booby trapping with his entasis.<sup><a href="#footnote_10_97332" id="identifier_10_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Entasis, ecstasies, wadda hell's da difference. 
In any case, guy's pretty good with the throwbacks, sure squeezing his cvasi-literate audience for all they're worth. Imagine him as a droning math teacher, beginning each class with `and what did we learn yesterday` instead of this, and suddenly the difference's obvious : squares ain't worth much. Nevermind the pimp being too stupid to beat his whore right -- the square's too boringly ineffectual to even get a name. Perhaps it's not by choice the square doesn't beat his mommy ? Perhaps it's not just because Jesus doesn't come with thorn whips in his dreams that he doesn't beat his mommy ?">xi</a></sup></p>
<p>I said, "Jack, I didn't expect your call for a coupla days. What happened?"</p>
<p>He said, "There's a big boxing match tonight. All the biggest pimps and whores in the country are gonna be at Sweet's after the fight. Kinda like a party. All of 'em use stuff. Even with Sweet as the middleman I should take off a coupla grand for my end."<sup><a href="#footnote_11_97332" id="identifier_11_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Ultimately the reason this guy's willing to spend his time and padplace on some rando Young Blood is that his dealing's so hot it's actually allowing him to out-earn a five whore stable. So he likes it enough he's willing to treat it well, put the love on it as it were.
Ever regarded dope dealing as a labour of love before ? Well... what they say is reading widens perspectives ; and this is why.">xii</a></sup></p>
<p>"Sweet never goes to fights. He can't stand big crowds, and besides they won't let Miss Peaches into fights. Sweet's gnawing his nails waiting for this stuff. He ain't got none for himself and he's anxious to cop some stuff for those birds coming from the fight."</p>
<p>I said, "Have you cracked anything about me to him?"</p>
<p>He said, "Kid, you ain't hip I'm a genius? He called and I rapped<sup><a href="#footnote_12_97332" id="identifier_12_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The meaning wasn't even then simply `talk` but more `talk to, talk of`, a recital of some kind, a monologue delivered. The Speaker of the House raps for the whole house.">xiii</a></sup> to him this morning. I played you off as my punk nephew from Kansas City. You got wild ideas you wanta be a pimp. I've tried to chill you back to K.C. to maybe hustle pool or even be a broom mechanic. You're a stupid, stubborn punk. I've told you a thousand times you ain't got it to pimp. You gotta pimp. You would eat ten yards of Sweet's crap. You think he's God. You won't believe your uncle is tight with God. I'm Glass Top. I gotta save face even for a snot-nosed punk. Maybe if you hang around the inside of the fast track for a hot minute you'll get scared. You'll wise up, get outta my ass and run your ass back to K.C. Now Kid, don't shoot your jib off at his pad. If he don't remember you from the Roost, don't wake him up."</p>
<p>I said, "Don't worry Top. I won't rank us. I'll never forget you, pal, for the cut in. That was sure some beautiful stuff you played for Sweet."</p>
<p>He caressed his patent-leather hair.<sup><a href="#footnote_13_97332" id="identifier_13_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Bwahaha.">xiv</a></sup> He erected his wide shoulders inside his blue mohair jacket.<sup><a href="#footnote_14_97332" id="identifier_14_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This guy'd have made such a great poker player.">xv</a></sup> His pretty, bitch face wore that terrible conceit and awful pride maybe of a cute mass murderer who never gets her victims' blood on her.<sup><a href="#footnote_15_97332" id="identifier_15_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Ha! I think this is actually his best one so far. I wonder, however vaguely, how much this guy'd have enjoyed being made my bitch, in the simple sense and through the simple procedure of having his best stuff singled out among the morass (and maybe his worst stuff singled out too -- who am I kidding `maybe`). The actual bitches sure like it, though the younger ones tend to first throw their interpretation of a hissy fit about it, just in case. Gotta save face, rite.">xvi</a></sup> The full moon through the windshield shone flush on his face.</p>
<p>He said, "Kid, you ain't heard nothing yet. Shit, I done drove three whores screaming crazy with this brain. They in the boob box upstate right now babbling about Pretty Glass Top. Even Sweet ain't shipped but two up there. He's been pimping almost twice as long as me."<sup><a href="#footnote_16_97332" id="identifier_16_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="An interesting competition point. How many women have you driven crazy, in the legal sense of that term ? Can it even be done, can someone make a woman crazy, in your estimation ? Is not trying what you actually promise them, in your little lost jew ceremony ?">xvii</a></sup></p>
<p>I said, "Christ, Top, I don't get it. Why drive a whore nuts if she's still humping out the scratch. A stud would have to be slick as grease to plant bats in the skull of a bitch that was sane. I can't dig how a stud could do it. I ain't hip to it."<sup><a href="#footnote_17_97332" id="identifier_17_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Right ?">xviii</a></sup></p>
<p>He said, "Sucker, what you don't dig, and ain't hip to would make a book bigger than this Hog. Now you take Sweet, the two he crossed were young white broads with small mileage.<sup><a href="#footnote_18_97332" id="identifier_18_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Who do you suppose is the world-wide, all-time champion whore for mileage ? Where do you think she oozed, Europe ? Asia ? Chicago ?">xix</a></sup> He's sick in the head. He's got an insane hate for the whole white race. He was a crumb crusher of seven down in Georgia<sup><a href="#footnote_19_97332" id="identifier_19_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The actual events here alluded to actually occurred in 1918, the shooting specifically on May 16th. The black man involved was 19 ; the white man was 31, and rather frail mentally. He was well known as an inept (and abusive) plantation owner (Old Joyce Place), perhaps even ineptly abusive to such a superlative degree as to warrant the `pimp` designation. As he couldn't acquire labour on the open market, he worked the penal system. At some prior point that year Hampton Smith paid Sydney Johnson's 30 dollar fine (for shooting crap) and thereby acquired the nigger as `leased labour`. Though no rape is specifically recorded, Smith did beat Johnson at least a coupla times, at least one of which for refusing to work (while self-diagnosedly ill) before Johnson shot him, after which a bunch of white people were angered enough to kill a further baker's dozen of them there coons, often through exuberant procedures. Such is the case of Hayes and Mary Turner -- Hayes was taken from custody two days after the shooting and lynched ; his wife swore she'd prosecute the participants for murder so she was `taught a lesson` in the manner of being taken to the Folsom Bridge crossing at Little River, being tied by the ankles, hung upside down from a tree, doused in gasoline / motor oil and then set on fire (alive). As she vocally roasted, some dude went at her with a butcher's knife, opened her abdomen causing her child to fall to the ground, where it cried (once) before being stomped underboot.
Contrary to common (if ulterior, and anachronistic) fetishisation, rape wasn't really that high on the list of interests of the 1918-era party goers.">xx</a></sup> when the white folks first poisoned his skull. His mammy was jet black and beautiful. The peckerwoods for miles around were aching to lay her. The son of the wealthy plantation owner that Sweet's old man sharecropped for way-laid her on the way to a spring. He punched her out, tore her clothes off and socked it into her. She was naked and crying when she got back to her shack. The peckerwood pig hid out in the woods.<sup><a href="#footnote_20_97332" id="identifier_20_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="But...why.">xxi</a></sup> Sweet's old man came in from the fields and found his wife clawed and bawling. He was close to seven feet and weighed three hundred. Sweet still remembers how his old man hollered and butted his head against the door of the shack. The hinges ripped loose. He knew the woods like a fox.<sup><a href="#footnote_21_97332" id="identifier_21_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="A fox of three hundred ?">xxii</a></sup> He found the white boy. He left him for dead. He covered him with brush. He slipped back to his shack. Sweet remembers the white boy's blood on his old man, even on his old man's bare feet. He had stomped the white boy to a red pulp out there in the lonely woods.<sup><a href="#footnote_22_97332" id="identifier_22_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Reheheheally ?">xxiii</a></sup> The old man figured he was safe. The white folks would never find the corpse in those thick woods. He cleaned himself, repaired the shack door, and waited. He hadn't croaked the white boy.<sup><a href="#footnote_23_97332" id="identifier_23_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="What a fox!">xxiv</a></sup> He had only maimed and paralyzed him. That night a white man out possum hunting with his dogs heard the kid bleating under the brush. He was out of his skull. It was midnight before the kid's raving made sense to the white folks. Sweet heard the mob's horses galloping toward the shack.<sup><a href="#footnote_24_97332" id="identifier_24_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="No such thing as a mounted black man back then, huh.">xxv</a></sup> He hid in the loft just as the crazy gang came through the shack slammer. Sweet peeped through a crack and watched them beat his old man's head bloody. They dragged him outside. Sweet saw the whole mob rape his mother. Finally all was quiet except for his mother whimpering on the bed. He sneaked out of the loft. Through the open door he saw his old man swinging in the moonlight from a peach tree in front of the shack. His mammy went to the funny farm. Sweet was taken in by a share-cropper on the same plantation. He worked the fields until he got seventeen. He ran away and caught a freight train North. He was eighteen when he got his first whore. She was a white girl. He drove her to suicide before he got nineteen. Sweet's gotta be sixty now. He paused. He steered the Hog with one hand. He took a cigarette from his jacket pocket. He punched in the dashboard lighter.</p>
<p>I thought, "No wonder Sweet's off his rocker. I wonder why Top really gave me that tight rundown on Sweet?"</p>
<p>The lighter popped. Top lit his cigarette. He sucked hard. He blew out a white cloud against the windshield that for an instant blotted out the moon.</p>
<p>He said, "I ain't insane like Sweet. My skull is clear and cool. I ain't no mixed-up Southern nigger. I was born in the North I grew up with white kids. I don't hate white people or any other people. I ain't no black brute. I'm a pretty brown-skin lover. I love people.</p>
<p>"When I was a square, I was even engaged to marry a white girl. Her parents and friends put pressure on her and she chickened out. I guess I loved her. Right after we quit I went to a hospital for my nerves. I ain't had nothing but whores since. It's like I told you when I met you. Sweet's a Ford and I'm a Duesenberg. He's just an ugly lucky nut."</p>
<p>I said, "But Top you cracked your booby-box score was higher than Sweet's. Those three gibbering bitches upstate sure don't show no love for whore people."</p>
<p>He said, "There you go, fool. A young chump is just like a dumb bitch. He can't figure nothing out himself. He's gotta have a rundown on everything. Of course I drove those whores crazy, but for a sane reason, sucker. A pimp cops a whore. He cons her maybe if she stays in his corner humping his pockets fat, at the end of the rainbow she's got a husband and a soft easy chair. To hold her beak to the grindstone, he pumps air castles into her skull.<sup><a href="#footnote_25_97332" id="identifier_25_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Ultimately this'd be the problem with `pimping` as practiced by young black studs from the ghetto, be it Chigaco's ghetto in Indiana or New York's ghetto in Harlem &#038; the Bronx indistinctly : that it doesn't deliver the promised outcomes. Just like all other nigger-riggings, nigger-pimping has little to do with either pimping in general as practiced or in principle as devised. The flavour thereof here contemplated eminently sits down in classification as just another colonial cargo cult, vague pallid immitation of the practices of the metropolis. 
Capitalism works the same way, whether one considers the trade in women, or in goods of whatever kind, or in abstracts of whatever kind, or in anything else. This is its fundamental importance, and the hot core that makes capitalism both unavoidable and unavoidably important : that it exposes the inescapable commonality of trade to the human mind, that it permits deliberate, conscious, reflective and analytical access to the essence of reality. Yes women are traded just like bananas are traded. That's because women are just like bananas. Yes children are traded just like silicone chips are traded. That's because children are not any `specialer` than women, or bananas. Yes `your` ideas aren't yours (whatever `yours` is even supposed to be, lord help us), but traded, like bananas and silicone chips, therefore enacting the very possibility of a yours in the first place! What, you thought you're born with a 2nd person pronoun, somehow, magically ? How ? Yes, capitalism is capitalism, mandatory not optional, universal not debatable, and yes it'll make fools of your spurious, self-generated notions of `yourselves` with the very tools at its disposal, which are everything. Essences don't need any `help`, what the fuck's helping universal rules even supposed to look like. And no, kink high is powerless to `do` anything `about it`. How the fuck would your fashions &#038; assorted fesserias dent the very laws of thermodynamics ?
Moving down the pole : colonial `capitalism`, the troglodytes' subcapitalism works the same degraded way throughout the native hordes. This particular corner of subcapitalism can't sanely be claimed exceptional on `moral` grounds, it's the blacks that are just as bad at pimping as they are at entrepreneurship or commercial navigation. Who discovered Madagascar ?
There's nothing special about whoring ; the coincidence that while you would really really like some pussy the only way you can get through your days of getting none to very little is by telling yourself `it's out of my hands` doesn't make pussy special -- it makes you a laughingstock. Yes, pussy may be out of your hands, but that'd be because your hands are your hands, in counterdistinction to being my hands. The matter's very much in my hands -- amusingly enough, both in regards to how much pussy I get, and in regards to how much pussy you get. Fastidious self-stroking among the trite old lines of `you don't even want it like that` could perhaps wrap your head with a towel, making it `night` `for you` like that works for chickens, but...
In summary : poor blacks being terrible at pimping is unsuprising, as they're equally bad at everything else they set their hands to try, and unimportant, as it doesn't speak to pimping, it speaks to poor blacks -- which nobody gives shit one about, not in any central or fundamental sense. Point in case : upon reading `Pimp` by `Iceberg Slim` you didn't set about to whoring out your wive &#038; daugthers, even though upon reading Das Kapital you set about to ruining your life and country. Well ? What more's needed, that Marx dude had three... maids, let's call 'em, at a time, one of which pregnant most of the time.">xxvi</a></sup> She takes all the stable grief. She humps her ass into a cramp to outshine the other whores in the family. At first, it's easy for the bitch to star. As she gets older and uglier her competition gets younger and prettier. She don't have to be no brain to wake up there ain't no easy chair at the end. She gets hip there ain't never even been a rainbow.<sup><a href="#footnote_26_97332" id="identifier_26_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This is gross (if self-serving) exaggeration ; of course there is. Maybe it's not coming from the asshole of some two-bit `[2nd] best in the world` pimp from Chicago ; but not the whole world's Chicago.">xxvii</a></sup> She gets larceny in her heart. She bullshits herself that if she can drive all those young pretty whores away from the pimp that rainbow might come true after all. If it don't, she'll get her revenge anyway. It's a violation of the pimp book to quit a whore.<sup><a href="#footnote_27_97332" id="identifier_27_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Check it out, they re-wrote that `death do us part` bit into their good book! How about that!">xxviii</a></sup> A bitch like that is a ticking bomb. Every day, her value to the pimp drops to the zero line. She's old, tired, and dangerous. She can rattle a pimp into goofing his whole game. If the pimp is a sucker he'll try to drive her away with his foot in her ass. She's almost a cinch to croak him or cross him into the joint. I'm a genius.

I don't tip her I'm salty and disgusted. I talk like a sweet head-shrinker to her.

<p>He had been driving for at least an hour. I had lost track of time and space. I saw no black faces in the streets around us. I saw tall gleaming apartment houses. Some so tall they seemed welded to the night sky.</p>

We stepped into the green-and-pearl lobby. A tan broad as flashy as a Cotton Club pony sat behind a blond desk. We walked across the quicksand pearl carpet to the front of it.

Her voice was contralto<sup><a href="#footnote_38_97332" id="identifier_38_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I wonder if he could pick out the contraltos from the lyrical sopranos on his own power.">xxxix</a></sup> silk.</p>

<p>She turned to an elderly black broad sitting before a switchboard beside her.</p>
<p>She told her, "Penthouse, Misters Stewart and Lancaster."</p>
<p>The old broad shifted her earphones from round her wrinkled neck to her horns. She plugged in and started batting her chops together. After a moment she nodded to the pony. We got the ivory flash again.</p>
<p>The pony said, "Thank you so much for waiting. Mr. Jones is at home and will see you."</p>
<p>I followed Top to the elevators. A pretty brown-skin broad<sup><a href="#footnote_39_97332" id="identifier_39_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Are all these `pretty broads` whores in training or what the fuck's going on here ?">xl</a></sup> in a tight green uniform zipped us to the fifteenth floor. The brass door opened. We stepped out onto a gold-carpeted entrance hall. It was larger than Top's living room.</p>
<p>A skinny Filipino in a gold lame outfit came toward us. He was grinning and bowing his head, his lank hair flopped across his skull like the wings of a wounded raven.<sup><a href="#footnote_40_97332" id="identifier_40_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Cuz pinoys have black hair, see.

<p>He said, "Good evening. Follow, please."</p>
<p>We followed him to the brink of a sunken living room. It was like a Pasha's passion pit. A green light inside the gurgling bowl of a huge fountain beamed on the vulgar face of a stone woman squatting over it. She was nude and big as a baby elephant. The red light inside her skull blazed, her eyes staring straight ahead. Her giant hands pressed the tips of her long breasts into each corner of her wide open mouth. She was peeing serenely and endlessly into the fountain bowl.</p>
<p>We stepped down to the champagne, oriental carpet. Sweet was sitting across the dim room on a white velour couch. He was wearing a white satin smoking jacket. He looked like a huge black fly in a bucket of milk. Miss Peaches was curled at his side. She was resting her black spotted head on a silk turquoise pillow. Sweet was stroking her back. She purred and locked her yellow eyes on us. I got a whiff of her raw animal odor.</p>
<p>Sweet said, "Sit your black asses down. Sweetheart, you been dangling me. What happened? Did that raggedy nickel Hog break down? So this is your square country nephew?"</p>
<p>Top sat on a couch beside Miss Peaches. I sat in a blue velour chair several yards to the side of Top. Sweet's gray eyes were flicking up and down me. I was nervous. I grinned at him.<sup><a href="#footnote_41_97332" id="identifier_41_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This was a speaking part, `Oh Mr God sir oh oh oh` etc.">xlii</a></sup></p>
<p>I jerked my eyes away to a large picture on the wall over the couch. A naked white broad was on her hands and knees. A Great Dane with his red tongue lolling out was astraddle her back. He had his paws hooked under her breasts. Her blonde head was turned looking back at him. Her blue eyes were popped wide open.<sup><a href="#footnote_42_97332" id="identifier_42_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Doggy style, right ?

<p>Top said, "Man, that Hog ain't no plane. I got here quick as I could. You know I don't play no games on you, Honey."</p>
<p>I said, "Thank you, Mr. Jones, for letting me come up with ‘unc.'"</p>
<p>My voice triggered the Roost memory. He stiffened and glared at me. He smashed his hooks together. It sounded like pistol shots. Peaches growled and sneered.</p>
<p>He said, "Ain't you the little shit ball I chased outta the Roost?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yeah, I'm one and the same. I want to beg your pardon for making you salty that night. Maybe I coulda gotten a pass if I had told you I'm your pal's nephew. I ain't got no sense, Mr. Jones. I took after my idiot father."</p>
<p>Sweet said, "Top, this punk ain't hopeless. He's silly as a bitch grinning all the time, but dig how he butters out the con to keep his balls outta the fire. He sure ain't got no tender dick to turn down my pretty big-ass Mimi. Kid, I love black boys with the urge to pimp. Ain't no surer way to amount to something. Your uncle ain't but a good pimp.

<p>Top said, "Shit Honey, you didn't have to tip him. I'm pulling for his split. I love the kid. I just don't think he can cut the pimp game. The kid raps good. I ain't denying it. He should be maybe a Murphy player or even a mitt man.<sup><a href="#footnote_43_97332" id="identifier_43_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Plain thief.">xliv</a></sup> His ticker ain't icy enough to pimp on this track."</p>
<p>I thought, "Top's pad is a pigsty compared to this layout. It looks like I'm in."</p>

<p>They went around a hand-painted gold silk screen through a doorway. Peaches padded behind them. I saw a bronze bell on a table beside the couch. I decided to get my own taste. I walked across the room to a turquoise bar. I went behind it. I took a tall crystal glass off the mirrored shelf on the wall. I mixed creme de menthe and bubbly water.</p>

However esteemable or inconsequential man may look to you, the question's more whether it's a whole man or merely half a man than anything else.
To put it plainly, it's not `because of religion` that Henry was a cuck. It's because Henry was a cuck that he had religion (and everything else coming with it, its whole entourage of sadness, bitterness, failure and misery). It's not because you're in the hospital that you've a cough (though yes, of course once you're in there you'll get some more, other coughs) but quite the other way around -- religion's merely the macula of dysfunction but not commonly the actual cause of it.">xlvii</a></sup> I remembered how I used to kneel every night by the side of the bed to pray.

The other reason is that whores wash more frequently and much more drastically than boring women, which means a larger proportion of that larger volume ends up on their skin.

<p>I stepped down and slid the door shut. An ebony satin-skinned pimp was sprawled in the blue velour chair. A tawny tan tigress was kneeling before him between his legs. She had her chin rammed into his crotch. She clutched him around the waist like a humping twodollar trick in an alley.<sup><a href="#footnote_59_97332" id="identifier_59_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I've a theory about deep throating, specifically that it was invented in such a circumstance, for a very specific reason.
So, suppose actual men (we're not discussing dirt here, nor am I going to keep making this point, so get it in your skull once and for all : if you've no harem you're not part of what's called a man) get together. Part and inseparable parcel of getting together is socialization, and in turn part and inseparable parcel of socialization is showing off. Therefore, even though it makes very little sense, the women will be put on sexual display -- just like you fuck her in an alley, say, or at the beach, even though in strict terms it'd have been much more comfortable to do it in the bed at home, just so you'll use her in front of the others. Not because `you really needed to`, but because you can -- and if you can, you must.
Sexual ownership, having very little to distinguish it from all other ownership, is a simple matter of exclusion ; so odds are the owner will be using her himself, if the display has anything to do with ownership, which indulge me in agreeing at least some of the times it will. Therefore, it'll be his penis and her. 
Sexual ownership correlates poorly with two things : doing the work, and being ridden. Such displays are most likely to be oral in nature because the sort of guy that enjoys owning women (and women enjoy being owned by) tends to ride her, as opposed to letting her ride him ; anal is potentially messy, so oral's left.
Now given that the point of the display is her and not his penis... well shed better fit it all in, yes ? There you go, deep throat's just been invented. Yes slow kissing of the glans followed eventually, half hour later, by a messy facial may be more enjoyable ; but it doesn't make for a better show.">lx</a></sup></p>

<p>I watched Cora's rear end twist away from me. She and the husky broad went to the bar and got a spoon and a glass of water. I looked at Sweet. He was giving me a cold stare.</p>

<p>The big joker stood there for a long moment with his eyes closed. He had a goofy grin on his face. One of his whores snickered. He slapped her hard against the jaw. He went to the bar.</p>
<p>I thought, "She sure has a head for business. Pepper was great, but she couldn't hold this broad's douche bag."</p>
<p>I got up and went behind the Chinese screen through the door. I went down a long hall. I passed three way-out bedrooms. I went into a mirrored john. It was as big as a bedroom. I pushed the door shut. I should have locked it.</p>
<p>I walked to the stool. I raised the lid. That tough bitch Red Cora darted in. She was licking out her red tongue. Her gray eyes were voodooing in her skull. She was hot as hell for my relative innocence and youth. She was a double murderess with a skull load of H and a hot jib.</p>
<p>I stood there before the deadly bitch. I searched the thin catalogue in my skull. I didn't know the right crack for a situation like this. I mumbled a plaintive pitch.</p>

<p>It was like trying to stand off a starving leopard with a broom straw. She snaked that shiv out of her bosom and popped the gleaming blade open. She clawed my fly open with the other hand. I heard buttons bounce on the tile floor. My ticker was doing a fox trot.</p>
<p>She said, "You jiving pretty sonuvabitch. You ain't no pimp. I'm gonna eat your sweet ass up or chop off your dick."</p>
<p>I backed up to the wall beside the stool. I could feel the wet throbbing tips of my fingers against the cool tile. She was grabbing inside when Sweet bulled in. He seized a fistful of her long hair. She squealed in pain. He jerked her away from me toward the door. He cussed her as he drove his needle-toed shoe into her wide caboose several times.</p>

<p>My back snailed down the wall. I laughed at the funny way the shoe tips turned in as the long legs glided across the tile. I sat there on the cool floor gazing at the weird comical legs stretched out before me.</p>
<p>I saw a pair of blue mohair legs right angle the flat ones. I looked up. It was Top. He bent over to help me up.</p>

<p>I riveted my eyes to the champagne carpet. I zigzagged through the snickering whores and pimps. I made it across the pit to the elevator. The Filipino was standing beside it. He was pressing the down button.</p>
<p>He looked like a friendly brown snake sausaged in gold foil. He reached up and stroked my jacket collar down flat from around my ears. He took my lid off the pearl tree. He stuck it on my skull and snapped the brim. I felt the sweat band needle the aching boil. I adjusted my lid.</p>
<p>He said, "Good night, Sir. Sammee hopes you had fine time."</p>
<p>I said, "Sammee pal, it's been a wild night. I'll never forget it."</p>
<p>I got a whiff of crotch as the elevator plunged to the lobby. I wondered if the pretty brown-skin jockey whored a little bit as a sideline.</p>
<p>I stepped out of the gilded cage into the lobby. I saw a winking red-arrowed sign in the rear. I walked to the glass door below it. I went down the white stone steps to the parking lot.</p>
<p>I spotted Top's red Hog in the ocean of cars. I went to it, unlocked it and got in. A big white Buick was parked in front of it. A grinning brown-skin joker in white overalls came toward the Buick.</p>
<p>I saw Smitty blue-stitched across his breast pocket. He pulled the Buick out. I keyed the Hog and scooted it out of the lot. I whipped around the corner and coasted to the curb fifty feet from the entrance of Sweet's apartment building.</p>
<p>I shut the motor off. I lowered the driver's side window. I put my lid on the seat. I threw my head back on the top of the seat. I closed my eyes. I dozed. Something was crushing my jaw. A blinding spotlight burned into my eyeballs. I heard a fog-horn voice.</p>
<p>It blasted, "Police officers! nigger, what the hell you doing. What's your name? Show us your identification."</p>
<p>I couldn't answer with my jaw crushed in a vise. I was dazed. I lowered my eyes below the inferno of light. I saw a white brutish wrist. Thick black hair bristled on it. I saw muscles cord and ripple across it as the vise tightened around my jawbone. I wondered if the copper was Satan and I had croaked in the Hog and was being checked into Hell. Hell or not, Satan wanted identification. I remembered the Fox and the Horse.<sup><a href="#footnote_94_97332" id="identifier_94_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="He remembered what the fuck now ?!">xcv</a></sup> I didn't even have a hide.</p>
<p>Satan swung the Hog door open. The door frame blackjacked the top of my skull as Satan yanked me from the Hog. He released my jaw and slammed me across the hood of the Hog. My wet palms skidded on the top of it.</p>
<p>Satan's fellow demon was punch-frisking me from breast to shoe soles. He poked an index finger inside my shoe. I felt a tickle in the arch of my instep.</p>
<p>I said, "My name is Albert Thomas.<sup><a href="#footnote_95_97332" id="identifier_95_97332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Keks.

<p>I didn't finish. A galaxy of shooting stars orbited my skull. It was like a flame-hot poker was imbedded in that sore bump at the back of my skull.</p>
<p>I heard the tinkle of glass against the hood. I puked and nosedived to the hood. I felt the warm stinking mess against my cheek as I lay across the hood gasping.</p>
<p>Glass splinters sparkled on the hood. Satan had slugged his flashlight against my skull. I saw the fellow demon's shadow bobbing inside the hog. He was frisking it, too.</p>
<p>Satan said, "nigger, you got a sheet downtown? Whatta you do for a living?"</p>
<p>I whispered, "I've never been in trouble. I'm an entertainer. I'm a dancer."</p>
<p>He said, "You black, conning bastard. How in the fuck do you know what a sheet is? You been mugged, nigger. Stand up straight. I'm gonna take you downtown. You can jig a few steps on the 'show up' stage."</p>
<p>I struggled off the hood. I turned and faced him. I looked up into the red, puffy face. Top came around the back of the Hog and stood between us.</p>
<p>He said, "What's the beef, officer? This is my nephew and my Cadillac. The kid was waiting for me. He's clean. We been to a party at Sweet's. You know who he is. We're personal friends of his, you dig?"</p>
<p>Satan's puffy face creased into a hyena grin. He rapped on the windshield. I saw the demon's starch-white face peer over the rear seat. Satan waved him from the Hog. He clambered out and stood beside Satan.</p>
<p>Satan said, "Looks like we made a slight mistake, Johnnie. These gentlemen are pals of Mr. Jones. Mister, all your nephew had to do to beat the roust was mention a name. Christ, we have to do our job. There's a cat burglar operating in this district. The lieutenant is riding our asses to nab him.

<p>The rollers walked across the street. They got into a black Chevrolet and gunned it away. I took a handkerchief from my back pocket, and wiped my face.</p>
<p>I wiped the bits of loose glass and most of the puke off the hood. I threw the rag in the gutter. I got in the Hog. Top u-turned and headed back to Black Town. I touched the bump on my skull. I felt a spot of sticky ooze. My skull had only a tiny split. I wiped my fingers on the end of my lapel pocket handkerchief.</p>
<p>I thought, "If it gets any rougher on this track, I'll be punchy before long. Maybe I better take Preston's advice and go back to the sticks."</p>
<p>I said, "Jeez, Sweet Jones sure has got pull. It was like magic when you cracked his name."</p>

<p>I headed for the bathroom. I was standing over the stool. She followed me. She stood in the bathroom doorway. I looked over my shoulder at her.</p>

The black man involved was 19 ; the white man was 31, and <a href="http://trilema.com/2018/the-principal-agent-problem-or-how-america-went-away/?b=Harry&#038;e=Thaw#select">rather frail mentally</a>. He was well known as an inept (and abusive) plantation owner (Old Joyce Place), perhaps even ineptly abusive to such a superlative degree as to warrant the "pimp" designation. As he couldn't acquire labour on the open market, he worked the penal system. At some prior point that year Hampton Smith paid Sydney Johnson's 30 dollar fine (for shooting crap) and thereby acquired the nigger as "leased labour". Though no rape is specifically recorded, Smith did beat Johnson at least a coupla times, at least one of which for refusing to work (while self-diagnosedly ill) before Johnson shot him, after which a bunch of white people were angered enough to kill a further baker's dozen of them there coons, often through exuberant procedures. Such is the case of Hayes and Mary Turner -- Hayes was taken from custody two days after the shooting and lynched ; his wife swore she'd prosecute the participants for murder so she was "taught a lesson" in the manner of being taken to the Folsom Bridge crossing at Little River, being tied by the ankles, hung upside down from a tree, doused in gasoline / motor oil and then set on fire (alive). As she vocally roasted, some dude went at her with a butcher's knife, opened her abdomen causing her child to fall to the ground, where it cried (once) before being stomped underboot.</p>
<p>Contrary to common (if ulterior, <em>and anachronistic</em>) fetishisation, rape wasn't really that high on the list of interests of the 1918-era party goers.

Just like all other nigger-riggings, nigger-pimping has little to do with either pimping in general as practiced or in principle as devised. The flavour thereof here contemplated eminently sits down in classification as just another colonial cargo cult, vague pallid immitation of the practices of the metropolis. </p>
<p>Capitalism works the same way, whether one considers the trade in women, or in goods of whatever kind, or in abstracts <em>of whatever kind</em>, or in anything else. This is its fundamental importance, and the hot core that makes capitalism both unavoidable and unavoidably important : that it exposes the inescapable commonality of trade to the human mind, that it permits deliberate, conscious, reflective and analytical access to <a href="http://trilema.com/2014/on-essences/">the essence</a> of reality. Yes women are traded just like bananas are traded. That's because women are just like bananas. Yes children are traded just like silicone chips are traded. That's because children are not any "<a href="http://trilema.com/2009/exceptionalismul-feminin/?b=zdreanta%20de&#038;e=aruncat#select">special</a>er" than women, <em>or bananas</em>. Yes "your" ideas aren't yours (whatever "yours" is even supposed to be, lord help us), but traded, like bananas and silicone chips, <em>therefore enacting the very possibility of a yours</em> in the first place! What, you thought you're born with a 2nd person pronoun, somehow, magically ? How ? Yes, capitalism is capitalism, mandatory not optional, universal not debatable, and yes it'll make fools of your spurious, self-generated notions of "yourselves" with the very tools at its disposal, which are everything. Essences don't need any "help", what the fuck's helping universal rules even supposed to look like. And no, <a href="http://trilema.com/2014/kink-high/">kink high</a> is powerless to "do" anything "about it". How the fuck would your fashions &#038; assorted <em>fesserias</em> dent the very laws of thermodynamics ?</p>
<p>Moving down the pole : colonial "capitalism", the troglodytes' <a href="http://trilema.com/2020/forum-logs-for-23-sep-2018/#2476708">subcapitalism</a> works the same degraded way throughout the native hordes. This particular corner of subcapitalism can't sanely be claimed exceptional on "moral" grounds, it's the blacks that are just as bad at pimping as they are at entrepreneurship or commercial navigation. Who discovered Madagascar ?</p>
<p>There's nothing special about whoring ; the coincidence that while you would really really like some pussy the only way you can get through your days of getting none to very little is by telling yourself "it's out of my hands" doesn't make pussy special -- it makes you a laughingstock. Yes, pussy may be out of <em>your</em> hands, but that'd be because your hands are your hands, in counterdistinction to being my hands. The matter's very much in my hands -- amusingly enough, both in regards to how much pussy I get, and in regards to how much pussy you get. Fastidious self-stroking among the trite old lines of "you don't even want it <em>like that</em>" could perhaps wrap your head with a towel, making it "night" "for you" like that works for chickens, but...</p>
<p>In summary : poor blacks being terrible at pimping is unsuprising, as they're equally bad at everything else they set their hands to try, and unimportant, as it doesn't speak to pimping, it speaks to poor blacks -- which nobody gives shit one about, not in any central or fundamental sense. Point in case : upon reading "Pimp" by "Iceberg Slim" you didn't set about to whoring out your wive &#038; daugthers, even though upon reading Das Kapital you set about to ruining your life and country. Well ? What more's needed, that Marx dude had three... maids, let's call 'em, at a time, one of which pregnant most of the time.

One reason is that vaginal secretions are stimulated by friction, in a highly sexually active female the debit can be a good three degrees of magnitude higher than in a low activity female -- something like "the more you cut it, the thougher and harder it comes back" thing. The other reason is that whores wash more frequently and much more drastically than boring women, which means a larger proportion of that larger volume ends up on their skin. These factors together compose to a four degree of magnitude or so increase in sexually scented effluvia, meaning that if you get three whores in a room you can't miss they're whores.

<p>So, suppose actual men (we're not discussing <a href="http://trilema.com/2019/usta-swingers-club-ul-jozefa-strusia-5-in-warsaw-poland-and-other-things/?b=dir&#038;e=t#select">dirt</a> here, nor am I going to keep making this point, so get it in your skull once and for all : if you've no harem you're not part of what's called a man) get together. Part and inseparable parcel of getting together is socialization, and in turn part and inseparable parcel of socialization is showing off. Therefore, even though it makes very little sense, the women will be put on sexual display -- just like you fuck her in an alley, say, or <a href="http://trilema.com/2020/de-as-fi-crai-de-ghinda/?b=So%20as%20I%20was%20saying&#038;e=appropriates#select">at the beach</a>, even though in strict terms it'd have been much more comfortable to do it in the bed at home, just so you'll use her in front of the others. Not because "you really needed to", but because you can -- and if you can, you must.</p>
<p>Sexual ownership, having very little to distinguish it from all other ownership, is a simple matter of exclusion ; so odds are the owner will be using her himself, if the display has anything to do with ownership, which indulge me in agreeing at least some of the times it will. Therefore, it'll be his penis and her. </p>
<p>Sexual ownership correlates poorly with two things : doing the work, and being ridden. Such displays are most likely to be oral in nature because the sort of guy that enjoys owning women (and women enjoy being owned by) tends to ride her, as opposed to letting her ride him ; anal is potentially messy, so oral's left.</p>
<p>Now given that the point of the display is her and not his penis... well shed better fit it all in, yes ? There you go, deep throat's just been invented. Yes slow kissing of the glans followed eventually, half hour later, by a messy facial may be more enjoyable ; but it doesn't make for a better show.
