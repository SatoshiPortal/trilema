		<description>@&lt;b&gt;pletzalcoatl&lt;/b&gt; Storylines are hard.

@&lt;b&gt;Diana Coman&lt;/b&gt; It's very much a numbers game (which is absolutely all I play online, because what the fuck do I need art games for, if I feel like that I got my Planescape : Torment and my King's Bounty and the whole &lt;a href=http://trilema.com/2010/eroii/&gt;Ho&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=http://trilema.com/2010/might-and-magic-vii-prooimion/ &gt;MM&lt;/a&gt; array not to mention the &lt;a href=http://trilema.com/2009/eu-ma-joc/ &gt;Gothics&lt;/a&gt; etcetera). Consequently video is a poor medium : it'd work fine to convey Morte's absurdist humour ; for the grandeur of the rock quest (we were talking last night, and it came to P:T being probably the best game &lt;em&gt;ever written&lt;/em&gt;, in the general, nevertheless that one quest pierces through, being the best quest ever) a still suffices -- but how's video to communicate the other players' humiliation by math ? It'd be a lot like trying to film people reading, possibly the biggest no-no in all cinema.

Then again, videos are all the fucktards make anymore (check &lt;a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPpp2v1j6G8&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; out), because (obviously) writing is hard (not to mention racist and rapist and &lt;a href=http://trilema.com/2013/a-very-unfair-perspective/ &gt;generally unfair&lt;/a&gt;) in that it requires &lt;em&gt;aforethought&lt;/em&gt; not to mention the scariest thing in creation -- balancing your books!!!11! You can't just introduce your characters as you need them, you can't just drop them off in one place, like taxis, and pick them up another as if by magic, you can't say one thing and then act as if you had said another, it's just... fundamentally arid for, unsupportive and very much &lt;a href=http://trilema.com/2011/terifiantul-oribilul-adevar-despre-venitul-suplimentar-asigurat/#comment-152779&gt;unvalidating&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=http://trilema.com/2009/identificarea-grupului-social-si-notiunea-de-bine/&gt;their&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=http://trilema.com/2020/forum-logs-for-03-oct-2017/#2345505&gt;mental&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=http://trilema.com/2011/cum-scriu-copiii-mediocri/ &gt;lifestyles&lt;/a&gt;.

Cinematic production requires &lt;em&gt;even more aforethought&lt;/em&gt; than writing, of course, but that is to do it well, which the pantsuits have "decided"/allagreed is no longer a thing, and so rather than hanging for the lamb of not doting their t's and thinking their written tautologies through, they prefer to hang for the heifer of hunchback-on-camera-against-a-wall-of-misery-coughing-and-hew-hawing-in-lieu-of-speech. &lt;a href=http://trilema.com/2009/pe-scurt-despre-analiza-tranzactionala/ &gt;The deals&lt;/a&gt; of socialism, you know -- &lt;a href=http://trilema.com/2018/oregon-represent/?b=My%20two%20favorite&#038;e=amazing&gt;and it would taste amazing!&lt;/a&gt;

Yet have a care : upgrading the Command Center from lvl 21 to 22 requires 15.1mn food, 8.09mn iron, 9.33mn stone, 8.40mn wood, and yields an army size increase from 110k to 120k, no increase in the army count and a climb in power from 5`935`989 to 7`980`667. Whence these numbers ? And when I say "not that bad", what I principally mean is, "these numbers are not far off enough from what they should be to warrant my indignation". That's still a long ways from great let alone eulora-divine, but it's also a long ways &lt;em&gt;the other way&lt;/em&gt; from what the zombie horde usually does.</description>

		<description>Out of curiosity, I did have a look around to see what can be found - it turned out mainly... videos on youtube that moreover seemed to be mainly made to basically advertise the maker and his various begging places (patreon, whatevers). At which point I entirely lost my patience, such as it was with it. 

Then again, how exactly (more precisely: by/with whom) could it have been anything else, really.</description>
