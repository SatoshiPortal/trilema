		<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;I have been writing since I was 12 years old and never knew it would turn out to be a full-time career.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bwahahahaha.

The rewriting of certain corners of reality in pantsuit terminology / their description as imagined by the completely ignare sort of imbecile in question is just something the fuck else.

Really bitch, you've $a "since you were 12" &#038;&#038; "you never imagined it would turn out to be a full time career" where $a takes &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; values, including &lt;em&gt;writing&lt;/em&gt; ?

Seriously now : Kill them all, and let god sort out his own. There isn't a soul per the dozen grosse shamblers-about mouthbreathing all over verdant creation.</description>

		<description>Hi, I am Adna an expert in academic writing. 
 
I love solving people’s problems and make them happy. That is what I have been doing for many years now. 
I have been writing since I was 12 years old and never knew it would turn out to be a full-time career. I have also been able to manage several assignments that involves writing. And I worked in three organizations as a volunteer to assist people.My interest has always been to help people succeed. And I go the extra mile to make that happen. 
I enjoy writing books and have helped people from countries like UK. 
I work with a company whose mission is to provide quality papers and make people happy. In fact, many clients come to me for professional help on a daily basis because they know I always deliver. And I will continue to provide nothing but quality to build trust like I have been doing for the past few years.
