<p>First thing back in Milwaukee, I reported to my parole officer, a Mr. Rand, I think. After asking a thousand questions and filling out a mountain of papers he gave me an I.Q. test. When he computed my score his sea-blue eyes saucered in surprise.</p>
<p>He couldn't understand how a boy with a score of one-hundred and seventy-five<sup><a href="#footnote_0_97312" id="identifier_0_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Get the fuck out of here, 175.

<p>If that I.Q. test had been on the basis of the half-baked criminal, pimping theories that I had picked up in the joint at that table from those Chili pimps<sup><a href="#footnote_2_97312" id="identifier_2_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="One whore pimps, ie guys with no money and no game.">iii</a></sup> that were churning in my mind, and that I was so eager to try, my score would have been zero.<sup><a href="#footnote_3_97312" id="identifier_3_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="That's not how IQ tests work.">iv</a></sup></p>

My maroon eyes were deeply set, dreamy. My shoulders were broad and my waist as narrow as a girl's.</p>
<p>I was going to be a heart breaker all right. All I needed was the threads<sup><a href="#footnote_5_97312" id="identifier_5_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Clothes.">vi</a></sup> and a whore.</p>
<p>Mama's small, lucrative beauty shop was on the main drag. Poor Mama, she was doomed I guess to inadvertently set up my disasters.<sup><a href="#footnote_6_97312" id="identifier_6_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Yo Mama's a whore. Seriously now, how much IQ does it take to figure it out ?">vii</a></sup></p>
<p>I had started on my job delivering for the drugstore owned by the friend of my Mama's who had hired me to satisfy the parole condition of a job upon release.</p>
<p>As fate would have it, Mama's shop and the drugstore were in the same building. Mama and I lived in an apartment over the storefronts.</p>
<p>Mama called me in from the sidewalk one day about three months after I had gotten parole. She wanted me to meet one of her customers who was getting her eyebrows arched. I walked through the pungent odors rising from the hot pressing combs pulling through the kinky hair of several customers, to the rear of the shop.</p>
<p>There she was, flashy as a Christmas tree, sitting before a mirror at a dressing table with her back to me. Mama stopped plucking at her brows as she introduced us, "Mrs. Ibbetts, this is my son Bobby."</p>
<p>Like a yellow cat hypnotizing a bird, she sat there motionless, her green eyes smoky, as she stared at me through the mirror.</p>
<p>Then the velvet purring voice undulated toward me, she said, "Oh Bobby, I have heard so much about you.<sup><a href="#footnote_7_97312" id="identifier_7_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Wut ?!
Da fuck's this dumb broad heard, `oh, kid's in reformatory after trying to market a fifteen year old hussy to her dad's friends &#038; coworkers` ? Or what exactly is this eighteen year old notable for, `he eats bush good, ever since he was three` ? There's nothing the fuck here, I'm three chapters in not to mention forewords and fore-forequotes, and I got nothing the fuck to show for it!
Go cut down a god damned cherry tree, motherfucker!">viii</a></sup> It's so exciting to meet you, but please call me Pepper, everyone does."</p>
<p>I don't know what excited me more as I stood there, her raw sensuality or the blazing rocks on her tapered fingers that I was sure hadn't come from Kresges. I mumbled something like I had to go back to the drug store to work, and I would see her around.</p>
<p>Later I saw her slide into her sleek Caddie convertible, her white silk dress riding up exposing the satin sheen of her banana yellow thighs. As she gunned away from the curb, she turned deliberately and gave me a full dose of those hot green eyes. She was signing our deal.<sup><a href="#footnote_8_97312" id="identifier_8_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Don't tell me the dweeb's lucky enough Chinese Malena over here picks him to whore for.
It's okay to ask the reader to believe the impossible ; but please, not the improbable.">ix</a></sup></p>
<p>I quizzed around and got the background on her. She was twenty-five, an ex-whore<sup><a href="#footnote_9_97312" id="identifier_9_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Da fuck's an ex whore ?!">x</a></sup> who had worked the jazziest houses on the Eastern Seaboard.<sup><a href="#footnote_10_97312" id="identifier_10_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Bullshit. I personally took a year to (rectinilearly!) traverse this Eastern Seaboard. No fucking way she worked all the jazziest houses before she was twenty-five, unless she's twenty-five in whale years or some shit.
But whatever, I get it, bitch did a stitch or two in New Orleans or Atlantic City or who knows where, Pittsburgh. Is Boston on the Eastern Seaboard ?">xi</a></sup> A wealthy white fence and gambler had tricked with her out there, and it had gotten so good to him that he crossed<sup><a href="#footnote_11_97312" id="identifier_11_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Since they're using `trick` to describe punting they're stuck using `crossing` to describe... tricking.

Have you punted Jesus yet ?">xii</a></sup> her pimp into a five-year bit<sup><a href="#footnote_12_97312" id="identifier_12_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Always a risk for pimps, to the degree they're generally better off giving the hotties away, as gifts, at the slightest provocation. At least, that's how the only successful ones I ever saw operated. It really makes no sense for the pimp to try and keep her, anyway, she's universally more trouble than she's worth, and besides, a pimp makes his money out of the workhorses, the used up, banged up old nags nobody wants to take home under any circumstances.
What, you thought it was more glamorous than that ? Naw, sorry to disappoint. A pimp's a sort of sewer -- maybe a bottle opener at the very most, but aside from that brief moment good cunt's privately owned and privately circulated.">xiii</a></sup> and squared her up.</p>
<p>Three days later, a half hour before closing, an order came in for a case of Mums. The address was in the plush Height's, miles from the store.</p>
<p>I made the trip on a bicycle. She answered the door wearing only a pair of white lace step-ins.<sup><a href="#footnote_13_97312" id="identifier_13_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Style of lingerie popular at the time. Coullottes basically.">xiv</a></sup> My erection was hard and instant.</p>
<p>It was a fabulous pad, and the lights were soft and blue. The old man wouldn't be back for a week.<sup><a href="#footnote_14_97312" id="identifier_14_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The problem's that this is now no longer the `gripping` and `authentic` story of Iceboy Slurp, `a self-made pimp` from `the street`.

If she hadn't picked him up, he wouldn't exist ; if she had pushed a different way, he'd have gone, spinning, inconsequential top, teetering that way. The author just decapitated his character, and I suspect without a back-up plan in mind.">xv</a></sup></p>
<p>I was just a hep punk, I wasn't in her league, but one of my greatest assets has always been my open mind. That freak bitch cajoled and persuaded me to do everything in the sexual book, and a number of things not even listed.<sup><a href="#footnote_15_97312" id="identifier_15_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Again with `the book` ? What the fuck `number of things not even listed`, she had two other women on all fours and shoved her fists into their cunts such that every thrust in her propagated down the tree ?

<p>What a thrill for a dog like her to turn out a tender fool like me. She was a hell of a teacher all right<sup><a href="#footnote_16_97312" id="identifier_16_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Again with the vague bullshit ?

If Pepper had lived in the old Biblical city of Sodom the citizen's would have stoned her to death.<sup><a href="#footnote_17_97312" id="identifier_17_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="So did she take it in the ass a lot, or does the author simply lack propriety of expression ?">xviii</a></sup></p>
<p>She nibbled and sucked hundreds of tingling bruises on every square inch of my body. Fair exchange, as the old saw goes, is never robbery.<sup><a href="#footnote_18_97312" id="identifier_18_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="A) those don't heal in whatever's left of a week, so no fucken way she stood for it ; and 2) I've yet to meet a professional who appreciated this pubescent sort of marking even without the sponsor problem. But... who knows, maybe they're different on `the Eastern Seaboard`, which is to say someplace I've been and this Indiana-Wisconsin-Milwaukee redneck's never seen.
Speaking of which -- this junk is rapidly collapsing into the plot of Shampoo poorly re-done by a terrible writer.">xix</a></sup></p>
<p>It took me a week to get the stench of her piss out of my hair.<sup><a href="#footnote_19_97312" id="identifier_19_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="If that were how this worked I'd never piss on my whores.

<p>She had taught me to snort girl, and almost always when I came to her pad, there would be thin sparkling rows of crystal cocaine on the glass top of the cocktail table.</p>
<p>We would snort it through alabaster horns<sup><a href="#footnote_21_97312" id="identifier_21_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Alabaster doesn't keep a very sharp edge and readily grinds, so maybe that's not the best choice for a straw.

None of this is relevant for the girls, which is why the bowls are there at parties, but really : it's for them, not for you.">xxiii</a></sup></p>

<p>I couldn't know at the time that at the end of the line stood the grim State Penitentiary.<sup><a href="#footnote_25_97312" id="identifier_25_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Oh, really ? And why not, too many digits in dem dat eyqueue ?">xxvi</a></sup></p>
<p>I was green all right and twice as soft and Pepper knew it. Here was a hardened ex-whore who knew all the crosses, all the answers<sup><a href="#footnote_26_97312" id="identifier_26_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Motherfucker, what `all` ? There's no fucking `all`. List.

<p>The dazzling edge on our orgies was dulling for me<sup><a href="#footnote_28_97312" id="identifier_28_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Gtfo, 18 yo straight out of the can ?!">xxix</a></sup>, but I was flipping Pepper with the techniques she had taught me. I knew all the buttons<sup><a href="#footnote_29_97312" id="identifier_29_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Again ?!">xxx</a></sup> to push for her, and she burned hotter than ever for her little puppy.</p>
<p>No wonder I was freaking for free, those Eastern pimps had charged her a fortune.</p>
<p>I tried one night to get a C note from her for a suit. I knew I had really come on fine in the bed. She had almost climbed the walls in her passion.</p>
<p>"Sugar," I said, "I saw a wild vine for a bill downtown. If you laid the scratch on me, I could cop tomorrow."</p>
<p>She slitted her green eyes and laughed in my face, and said, "Now listen Lil' Puppy, I don't give men money. I take it from them, and besides, as sweet as you are to this pussy, you don't need a suit. I like you as you are, with no clothes on at all."</p>
<p>I was a rank greenhorn, sure, but her cold turn down of my plea for the C note was bitchy cute, and I was a salty sucker, so I reacted like any stupid would-be pimp who had been Georgied.</p>
<p>I had fouled up basic business. I had led with my dick instead of my mitt.<sup><a href="#footnote_30_97312" id="identifier_30_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Hand.">xxxi</a></sup></p>
<p>I reached down and slapped her hard against the side of her face. It sounded like a pistol shot. On impact a thrill shot through me. I should have slugged her with a baseball bat.<sup><a href="#footnote_31_97312" id="identifier_31_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="No dumbass, you should've ordered her on her knees, bubblin' dat butt out, and worn your belt down on her a few layers. Wtf.">xxxii</a></sup></p>
<p>The bitch uncoiled from that bed like a striking yellow cobra, hooked her arms around my waist and sank her razor sharp teeth into my navel.</p>
<p>The shock paralyzed me. I fell on my back across the bed moaning in pain. I could feel blood rolling from the wound down toward my crotch, but I couldn't speak. I couldn't move.<sup><a href="#footnote_32_97312" id="identifier_32_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Holy shit this nigga's worthless in a fight.">xxxiii</a></sup></p>
<p>Pepper was sure a strange twisted broad. She was breathing hard now, but not in rage. The violence, the blood, had turned her on.</p>
<p>She was gently caressing me as she licked, with a feathery tongue, the oozing wound on my belly. She had never been so tenderly efficient as she took me on a beautiful "trip around the Universe."</p>
<p>The funny thing was, that throbbing awful pain some how became a part of, melted into the joy of the feathery tongue, the thrill of the thing that Pepper was doing to me.</p>
<p>I guess Freud was right. If it thrills you to give pain, you can get your jollies taking it.<sup><a href="#footnote_33_97312" id="identifier_33_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Freud Masoch, right, right.">xxxiv</a></sup></p>
<p>When I left Pepper<sup><a href="#footnote_34_97312" id="identifier_34_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I keep reading `Popper`, as in Karl, which I confess is very disconcerting.
Then again, poor K.P. didn't ever score as high as 187 or whatever it was, 12`500.">xxxv</a></sup>, I was sapped. I felt like an old man. My mood was as bleak and cheerless as the gray dawn I cycled through.</p>
<p>When I got home and looked into the mirror, a death's head stared back at me. That vampire bitch was sucking my life's blood all right. I also knew that crystal cocaine wasn't exactly a health tonic.</p>
<p>Pepper was too fast, too slick for me. I had to make her shit or get off the pot.</p>
<p>I made the skeleton in the mirror a solemn vow that before the week was out I would in some way get Weeping Shorty, a pimp about fifty-five who, while a gorilla pimp, was the best pimp in town to pull my coat to give me a plan for putting a ring in Pepper's nose.</p>
<p>Before I got busted, I had seen him at Jimmy's joint. He had looked horrible then, and now less than a year and a half later he looked like a breathing corpse.</p>
<p>Hoss<sup><a href="#footnote_35_97312" id="identifier_35_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Heroin.">xxxvi</a></sup> was his Boss. He had chipped around<sup><a href="#footnote_36_97312" id="identifier_36_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Infrenquent pattern of heroin use believed by future junkies to protect from addiction. An eminently self-limiting activity.">xxxvii</a></sup> and gotten hooked. It was Friday, almost midnight when I found him.</p>
<p>He looked at me and made that clacking sound against the roof of his mouth with his tongue. You know, that mischievous, weirdly joyful sound that a young kid makes the instant before he rams a hat pin into your ear drum.<sup><a href="#footnote_37_97312" id="identifier_37_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="What the fuck ?!">xxxviii</a></sup></p>
<p>Then he said, "Well kiss my dead mammy's ass, if it ain't Macking Youngblood. The whore's pet and the pimp's fret."</p>
<p>The junkie bastard was jeffing on me, lashing me with contempt and scorn. Old pimps always know when a youngster with a yen for the pimp game is desperate for advice.</p>
<p>After all, they remember when they started and what a bitch it was just to learn the million questions. The answers would come slowly, from heart breaking trial and error, from the ass kissing of the few who had solved the riddle, who pimped by the book.</p>
<p>The cleverest pimp could give a thousand years and never come close to all the answers.</p>
<p>Weeping Shorty was an old man, and he had gotten past the questions and had worked out a few answers, but even so he knew a thousand times more than I did. So, I fought for control, I couldn't show anger. If I did he would cut me loose.</p>
<p>We had been standing under the awning of a vacant storefront. He pulled me with a jerk of his head, I followed him to a big shabby Buick. It was parked at an intersection in a cheap-trick district.</p>
<p>When we got inside the Buick I understood why he had parked it there. He could watch and keep tabs on his stable of scrawny, junkie whores working the four corners of the intersection.</p>
<p>He sat under the wheel not saying anything. His eyes straight ahead. I had kissed his ass for a half hour and now he was freezing up. I thought of the tiny pile of cocaine wrapped in tinfoil under my instep that I had filched from Pepper. I fished it out and held it in my hand. Perhaps the cocaine would open him up.</p>
<p>I turned to him and said, "Weeping, do you want a light snort of girl?"</p>
<p>He stiffened like a butcher knife had been run into his back. He looked at the wad of tinfoil in my palm and snatched it and in the same motion hurled it through the window on his side.</p>
<p>His top was blown, he shouted, "nigger, ain't you got no sense? You trying to go back to the joint and blow my wheels?"</p>
<p>I said, "What did I do wrong? All I did was to offer the C just to be sociable. What's wrong with that?"</p>
<p>He said, "Sucker, first booty butt, you don't transport no hard<sup><a href="#footnote_38_97312" id="identifier_38_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Drugs, though in a prison setting it'd work for any contraband.

Second, you're on parole. You're hot! You ain't got no business sitting dirty in my short.<sup><a href="#footnote_40_97312" id="identifier_40_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Car.">xli</a></sup> There's a law, sucker, that can confiscate a short with stuff in it. You know if the heat had hit on you you would unload in my short. Keep stuff off you. When you stop somewhere down it in the street until you ready to split. It's better to get beat for the stash than beat by the heat. Now what took your head outta Pepper's ass long enough for you to look me up?"</p>
<p>Oh! How this junkie creep bugged me. I sat there beside him trying to think of questions<sup><a href="#footnote_41_97312" id="identifier_41_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Now ?!">xlii</a></sup> that would bleed him so I could get out of his face fast. He looked exactly like a withered baboon. His breath stunk like he had just eaten a bowl of maggots.</p>
<p>I said, "Weeping, Pepper hasn't got my nose open for her. She's too jazzy and slick for me. I came to you because everybody knows that your game is mellow. I want you to pull my coat so I can pimp some scratch out of her."</p>
<p>The baboon liked that banana I threw him. He was ready to talk the pimp game.</p>

He had just raised it and was about to answer my proposition when there was a frantic rapping on his window. It was one of his whores.</p>
<p>Through the closed window of the locked door she said loudly, "Daddy, open the door! My feet are soaked. Nothing is happening out here tonight, and besides I am hot as Hell. The vice is watching me. It's Costello. He told me to get off the street or he would bust me.

<p>Weeping was a cold gorilla all right. He sat there for a long moment. His monkey face was tight and hard. He casually opened the wind wing as the rain beat down on his whore. She stuck her nose through it.</p>
<p>Without moving toward the wing, sitting erect in the car seat he hollered, "You bullshit bitch, make something happen. You a whore, you suppose to be hot. Let Costello bust you. He can't make a beef stand up unless he ketches you with a trick. You dumb chickenhearted bitch, whatta you think I got this ass pocket full of ‘fall' scratch for? Now get out there and work. Don't worry about the rain. Walk between the rain drops. Bitch."</p>
<p>He slammed the wing shut.</p>
<p>Her face was wild and angry through the murky glass. Her doperotted teeth were ragged fangs in the dimness as she pressed her face close to the glass.</p>
<p>She screamed, "You just lost a girl. You had four, now you got three. I'm cutting you loose, Shorty."</p>
<p>Weeping let his window down and stuck his head out into the rain as she walked away. He was all gorilla now.</p>
<p>He screamed, "Bitch, I give you odds you won't split. As much of my dope you been shooting, I'm playing ketch up. You rank bitch, you know if you split I'll find you and stick my knife in your stinking ass and gut you to your breast bone."</p>
<p>I wondered if he had lost her. He read my mind.</p>
<p>He said, "She ain't going nowhere, look at this."</p>
<p>He turned his car engine on and started the windshield wiper so we could see the street. There she was back out there in the rain whistling and waving at the passing cars.</p>
<p>He switched the engine off.</p>
<p>He said, "That bitch knows I ain't jiving. She'll make me some scratch this morning. Now Youngblood, about Pepper. You don't know anything about her. You ain't long out of the joint. I like you, so my advice is the same I gave you at first. Forget her. Try in another spot."</p>
<p>What he said about my not knowing her made me curious.</p>
<p>I said, "Look Weeping, I know you like me, and if you do, run Pepper down for me."</p>
<p>"Did you know that peckerwood of Pepper's is the bankroll behind the biggest policy wheel in town?"</p>
<p>I said, "No, but if the old man is flush isn't that good? Why give Pepper up because she's in shape. If you gave me an angle I could get some of that policy scratch."</p>
<p>"Look Blood, brace yourself. Here is the rest of the rundown. Pepper is a rotten freak broad. You ain't the only stud she freaks off with. I could name a half dozen who ride her. The dangerous one is Dalanski the detective. He is in a bad way over Pepper. If he ever found out you were freaking off with her, Blood, shame on your ass."</p>
<p>I was shaken by the rundown. Like a sucker I believed that I was the whole show in her love life. I was thinking like the young punk I was.</p>
<p>I said, "Are you sure there are that many studs laying her?"</p>
<p>He said, "Maybe more."</p>
<p>I had a bellyache and a worse headache. I felt lousy.</p>
<p>I mumbled, "Thanks for the advice and the run down, ‘Weeping.'" I got out of the Buick and walked home in the rain. When I got there it was three thirty and Mama was angry, worried and raving. She was right of course. I was violating my parole to be out after eleven P.M.</p>
<p>I was coming out of the drug store to make a delivery when I bumped into him on the sidewalk. It was old "Party Time."</p>
<p>While doing his year for our caper he had copped a lonely-hearts broad through the mails.</p>
<p>She went his train fare. He finished the bit and went to visit her and made a home.</p>
<p>She had died and the home went to relatives who threw him out. After five bits he was still full of crooked inspiration. I liked him, but not enough to join him again in a hustle. I had only been out four and a half months.

<p>The day before Weeping brought me a proposition, Dalanski, the roller, came into the drug store for cigarettes and gave me a thoughtful look.</p>
<p>I was walking home. It was my day off. It was Saturday night around nine. I had been to see a prison movie. It was a grim drama. A young green punk tried a double cross. He was criss-crossed into the joint. He made deadly enemies while doing his long bit.</p>
<p>When he got out, a long black short pulled up and riddled him with a tommy gun.</p>
<p>A big black car was pulling to the curb toward me. There was something familiar about that small pinhead driver. It was Weeping.</p>
<p>He jerked his head and opened the car door. I went over and got in. He was excited. At first I thought because his car was clean.<sup><a href="#footnote_48_97312" id="identifier_48_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Ahahaha.">xlix</a></sup></p>
<p>He told me, "Blood, put a smile on your face. Old Shorty's got good news for you. How would you like a half a G in your slide?"</p>
<p>I said, "All right, give me the poison and take me to the baby."</p>
<p>He said, "I ain't shucking. It's cream-puff work. In fact Tender Dick, it's what you like to do best. Want the run down?"</p>
<p>"If you are going to tell me some broad is going to lay out fivehundred frog skins to get her rocks off, say it.

Because the engine chokes. Because it's not made for going under water, it's made for something else.
Oh and since we're doing definitions : a hustler's someone who believes hard work can compensate for natural gifts, and goes to great pains to try and actualize this delusion. Meaning that yes, you're all hustlers, the whole `Western democracy` dog-and-pony show is little more than Hustlers United Present.">lv</a></sup> saw a chance to trim Pepper's old man out of a bundle.</p>
<p>The hustler knew that Pepper was a dog and a freak. He also knew that Pepper's old man was hung up on her.</p>
<p>Even though he had met her in a whorehouse and squared her up, he was dangerously jealous of her and unpredictable if he caught her wrong.<sup><a href="#footnote_55_97312" id="identifier_55_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Apparently also very poorly informed, a strange situation for a professional gambler.

<p>The hustler felt that Pepper would be in a sweet state for pressure<sup><a href="#footnote_56_97312" id="identifier_56_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="That's not what pressure means, holy fucksticks.
They keep arresting pressure racketeers here, let me recount for the rounding of this scrawny, junkie bullshit thread a coupla forms. There's the guys who rustle cattle, dressed as policemen, teams of dozen+, sometimes with actual stolen police cars sometimes with faked out police cars (often enough just without bothering). They show up on grazeland, pretend whatever nonsense, round up the cattle and leave -- it's pressure because whether the mark believes or doesn't believe, he's not about to start shooting at a dozen men pretending they're police : even if he's right and they aren't police, he's still just by himself, or with the dog, or with another guy and a kid, in any case they're not walking out of there. That's why it's a pressure hustle, because it doesn't so much matter whether the mark believes or doesn't, something most passionate hustlers despise, as they get their rocks off the (very limited, very narrow, and ultimately very unsatisfyingly crippled, but still -- it's all they got) personal interaction, the same thing I get naturally and in spades from my girls the passionate hustler gets torturously an' contortedly from his mark.
For another form, some derpy chick, too stupid to make it in, regaled us as part of her evening failure with a story to show that indeed her stupidity runs in the family. To wit, her brother, who (for some reason I've forgotten) had acquired a decent bundle of cabbage, got intercepted while walking downtown by some guy who `wanted to make friends`, which (according to him) consists of `exchanging gifts` (really, the story ran like `let me give you my card, which gotta be in this black bag, that's how it's done around here`), thereupon turning into `a plainclothes detective with the vice squad` threatening to `arrest` the chump unless he surrender his wallet. Pressure hustle through and through, shy `engineer` kid couldn't tell some built dude to take a walk, and that's when the matter was decided.
Anyways, it's something you'll meet soon enough, seeing how US DAs are pretty much Pressure Hustlers, Incorporated, which is how anal queens a la Charlie Shrem (or you) usually end up taking it up the ass for the very first time. Then it becomes pleasurable, from what I hear.">lvii</a></sup> if solid evidence could be gotten showing Pepper as the dog she was.</p>
<p>The hustler was sure he could force her to help him in his scheme to trim the old man. He needed clear unfaked photographs.</p>

In other words, I've yet to meet a jealous one. 
They will, however, often pretend jealousy, specifically because it empowers the woman. It sets up the double-cross, basically, you show up, `gather incriminating evidence` (which she's as likely as anything to actually notice, because duh ; but she's not likely at all to get in your way). Then she pretends shock and surprise and compliance as you demand of her, and then... she goes and tells the dude. Doh.

<p>The hustler would pay me five bills after I had brought Pepper to a prearranged set up.</p>
<p>I was all for the scratch, and eager to give Pepper some grief for the way she had used me, and outslicked me.</p>

<p>Pepper let me out of her Hog<sup><a href="#footnote_71_97312" id="identifier_71_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Yes, it's what cadillacs were called in the time-and-place.">lxxii</a></sup> at one-thirty in the A.M. just two blocks from Weeping's whore stand. I felt good. I was going to collect five fat ones for my pleasant night's work. It was like having a license to steal.</p>
<p>I spotted Weeping's pin-head in his Buick. As I walked toward him, I couldn't stop thinking about that Eastern blackmailer. I thought about that green rain that would fall when Pepper started rolling those phony hits in. I thought about how I could catch a few palms full.<sup><a href="#footnote_72_97312" id="identifier_72_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Wait for the bullet rain that'll start falling once the people running the wheel start moving. That'll be the main show!">lxxiii</a></sup></p>
<p>Smooth as silk the pay-off came off. When Weeping handed me my scratch he gave me a funny look.</p>
<p>He said, "Take it easy Blood, take it easy."</p>
<p>The next day I went downtown and got clean.<sup><a href="#footnote_73_97312" id="identifier_73_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="He means he got a shave, maybe even had his hair washed and the dirt scraped from under his fingernails ; and bought some clothes. Hopefully in that order.">lxxiv</a></sup></p>
<p>It was the early years for the Nat "King" Cole Trio. They were playing for a two-buck dance that night at Liberty Hall.<sup><a href="#footnote_74_97312" id="identifier_74_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Talk about land of opportunity. Everything else this dweeb's mouthing off about I've done, I'm doing, well, better. But never in Creation am I nor's anyone else gonna `o yeah, it was the early days of Nat King Cole, I paid a coupla bucks to be there`. Other names, yes. Of course. But never that one.
All other opportunities he might be wasting -- he sure as fuck didn't waste that one. Was it worth it, all the trouble he went to, all the hell he'll have to pay for those `five fat ones` ? Given that they're the fat ones that took him, `plenty clean`, to that dance ? 
Now you understand the criminal mindset : yes, of fucking course it was worth it. YOLO.">lxxv</a></sup> Party and I were in the balcony at a table overlooking the crowded dance floor. We were slaving like sand hogs trying to tunnel into<sup><a href="#footnote_75_97312" id="identifier_75_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="See, this is what I don't get... why not just lift their skirts and play with their kitties, if that's what you're after ?">lxxvi</a></sup> the flashy high yellows on our laps. They were almost stoned. Ready for the killing floor.</p>
<p>Party saw him first coming in the front door of the auditorium. He knifed me in the side with his elbow.</p>
<p>Then con style, from the side of his mouth, he whispered, "Dalanski, the heat."</p>
<p>The bastard's head was on a swivel. He was looking everywhere at once. I felt mad butterflies with stingers ricocheting in my belly when his eyes spotted me and locked on me. I froze, his eyes were still riveted to me as he walked up the stairway straight for me.</p>
<p>I pretended to ignore him. He walked up behind me and stood there for a long moment. Then he dropped a hand like an anvil on my shoulder.</p>
<p>He said, "Get up! I want to talk to you."</p>
<p>My legs were shuddery as I stood in a small alcove with him.</p>
<p>He said, "Where were you around ten and after last night?"</p>
<p>Relief and courage flooded me. That was easy; I hedged : "Why?"</p>
<p>He said, "Look punk, don't get cute. Where were you? Don't answer. I know where you were. You were out on Crystal Road in the nighttime burglarizing the home of Mr. and Mrs. Frank Ibbetts. Night-time burglary is five to ten."</p>
<p>My courage and relief swiftly drained out. Frank Ibbetts was Pepper's old man. He was roughly frisking me now. He ran his hands into my side pockets. With one hand he brought out the three hundred dollars left from my pay-off, plus twenty clean dollars. The other came out with a strange brass door key.</p>
<p>He said, "Jeez, for a flunky in a drug store you got a helluva bankroll. Where did you get it and where and what does this key fit?"</p>
<p>I said, "Officer, that's crap-game money. I have never seen that key before."</p>
<p>He grabbed me firmly like he had captured Sutton and walked me through the dancers out the door to his short.</p>
<p>He took me down[town] and booked me on suspicion of Grand Theft burglary. He also booked the scratch and key as evidence.</p>
<p>Mama came down bright and early the next morning. She was in a near fainting dither. She was clutching her chest over her heart.</p>
<p>She said, "Bobby, you are going to kill your mama. You haven't been out six months and now you are back in trouble. What's wrong with you? Are you crazy? You need prayer. Get down on your knees and pray to the good Lord."</p>
<p>I said, "I don't need to pray. Mama, believe me there is nothing to worry about. I didn't steal anything from Pepper's house. I am not nuts. Pepper will tell them the truth. Mama, I was with her."</p>
<p>I got my first nightmare inkling of the cork-screw criss-cross when Mama broke into tears. She rolled her eyes to heaven.</p>
<p>She blubbered, "Bobby, there's no hope for you. You are going to spend your young life in prisons. Don't you know Son, your mama loves you? You don't have to lie to me."</p>
<p>"I went out to see her early this morning," she said. "She told me she hasn't seen you in a week. Mr. Dalanski has brought Pepper's spare key down here. That key in your pocket was one you stole when you made a delivery out there."</p>
<p>Finally, she went down the corridor. Her shoulders were jerking in her sobbing.</p>
<p>It was an iron<sup><a href="#footnote_76_97312" id="identifier_76_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Strong, inescapable.">lxxvii</a></sup> cross. My public defender went to that hotel to get corroboration for my alibi. The joint had been too crowded, too hectic. None of the employees remembered Pepper and me. At least they said they didn't.<sup><a href="#footnote_77_97312" id="identifier_77_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Aww.
So what about `Mr. &#038; Mrs Berkshire` or whatever ? If the kid wasn't there with the woman, how come he knows what room number some random people checked into ? And what time ?

<p>The desk man on that night had been a substitute and wasn't now available.<sup><a href="#footnote_78_97312" id="identifier_78_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Da fuck's that mean, `wasn't now available`.">lxxix</a></sup> My signature wasn't on the register anyway.</p>
<p>I went into court again with the dirty end of the stick. I was a parolee arrested at one A.M. with a bottle of whiskey in front of me in a public place.</p>
<p>Pepper looked like a prospect for a convent. She had stripped herself of paint and gee-gaws. She testified that the key found in my slide<sup><a href="#footnote_79_97312" id="identifier_79_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Pocket.">lxxx</a></sup> was hers, and that yes, it was possible that I had stolen it while making deliveries to her home. No, she had not seen me for a week before my arrest.</p>
<p>My defender had gotten a change of venue. I was afraid to go before the judge who had sent me to the reformatory.</p>
<p>I got two years in state prison for grand theft, the amount, fivehundred dollars. My parole was to run concurrently with the new sentence.</p>
<p>Pepper's old man was with her in court. They bought the cross.<sup><a href="#footnote_80_97312" id="identifier_80_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Here's the problem : this guy, `a wealthy white fence and gambler`, necessarily knows it ain't possible for a kid to turn all the shit he had stolen into a few hundred in cash within twenty-four hours.

Moreover, he'd assuredly keep something --  I mean he was dumb enough to keep the key ?!
Kid's a patsy, Frank sees it, the judge sees it, they may not object to him going upriver for a spell, but they sure as hell ain't buying `the cross`.">lxxxi</a></sup> I couldn't figure who had sold it to them.</p>
<p>Was Dalanski the joker that Weeping worked for?

<p>For what reason had the old man bought it? Had those hotel employees been bribed or threatened?

<p>The Waupun State Prison was tough, but in a different way than the reformatory. Here the cons were older. Many of them were murderers serving life sentences.</p>
<p>These cons would never put up with the kind of petty tyranny that was practiced in the reformatory. Here the food was much better. There were industries here. A con could learn a trade if he wanted to.</p>
<p>He could go into the yard during recreation hours and learn other trades and skills. Here the desperate heist men congregated to plot new, more sensational robberies. The fruits and punks lay on the grass in the sun romancing each other.<sup><a href="#footnote_84_97312" id="identifier_84_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Honestly this 1930s prison sounds a lot fucking better than 2020s plebeian life.">lxxxv</a></sup></p>
<p>This was a prison of cliques, of bloody vendettas. I found my level with the soft spoken smooth Midwestern pimps and stuff players.</p>
<p>Since I was one of the youngest cons in the joint I bunked in a dormitory. It was like a suite in the Waldorf compared to the bug infested tight cells in the reformatory with their odious crap buckets.</p>
<p>It was there in that dormitory that I got the insatiable desire to pimp. I was a member of a clique that talked about nothing except whores and pimping. I began to feel a new slickness and hardness.<sup><a href="#footnote_85_97312" id="identifier_85_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Hopefully we're out of the woods already. I was rather getting fed up with having to peel layers upon layers of bullshit obviously made-up to uncle up to all sort and manner of pompously pretentious nonsense `from the real world`. Real nothing.">lxxxvi</a></sup></p>
<p>I worked in the laundry. I kept my clothing fresh and neat. It was in the laundry that I met the first man from whom I got cunning to balance my hardness.</p>
<p>He was an old Drag man with his bit getting short. He was the first to attempt to teach me to control my emotions.</p>
<p>He would say, "Always remember whether you be sucker or hustler in the world out there, you've got that vital edge if you can iron-clad your feelings. I picture the human mind as a movie screen. If you're a dopey sucker, you'll just sit and watch all kinds of mindwrecking, damn fool movies on that screen."</p>
<p>He said. "Son, there is no reason except a stupid one for anybody to project on that screen anything that will worry him or dull that vital edge.<sup><a href="#footnote_86_97312" id="identifier_86_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="In a trained psychologist's terms,

The moral being that society is not able to handle decisive people. It never was, it never will be, it simply can't. All that it can do is submit, trying its best to filter out and retouch the stronger contours wherever possible. In other words, society is the woman in the man-society relationship. If you let her make the rules she'll climb atop your head. If you go by what's coming out her mouth you'll end up drinkin tea in a miniskirt complete with stockings and garter belts. If on the other hand you grab her by the scruff of the neck and take her over the knee she'll happily suck your cock, glowing red butt and all. Basic stuff.
It's what it is.">lxxxvii</a></sup> After all, we are the absolute bosses of that whole theatre and show in our minds. We even write the script. So always write positive, dynamic scripts and show only the best movies for you on that screen whether you are pimp or priest."</p>
<p>His rundown of his screen theory saved my sanity many years later. He was a twisted wise man and one day when he wasn't looking, a movie flashed on the screen. The title was "Death For an Old Con."</p>
<p>He died in his sleep behind the high gray walls. His fate was that which lives like a specter with all cons. The fear of dying in a cell.<sup><a href="#footnote_87_97312" id="identifier_87_97312" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="And what's so bad about that ?">lxxxviii</a></sup></p>
<p>I sure missed that convict philosopher. The wisdom he taught me took me successfully through my bit. I was released after twenty-one months. I got three months "good time" for good conduct.</p>
<p>With "good time" I was free, hard, slick and bitter. No more small towns for me. I was going to the city to get my degree in pimping.</p>
<p>The Pepper cross had answered a perplexing question for me. Why did Justice really always wear a blindfold? I knew now. It was because the cunning bitch had dollar signs for eyeballs.</p>

<p>They keep arresting pressure racketeers here, let me recount for the rounding of this scrawny, junkie bullshit thread a coupla forms. There's the guys who rustle cattle, dressed as policemen, teams of dozen+, sometimes with actual stolen police cars sometimes with faked out police cars (often enough just without bothering). They show up on grazeland, pretend whatever nonsense, round up the cattle and leave -- it's pressure because whether the mark believes or doesn't believe, he's not about to start shooting at a dozen men pretending they're police : even if he's right and they aren't police, he's still just by himself, or with the dog, or with another guy and a kid, in any case they're not walking out of there. That's why it's a pressure hustle, because it doesn't so much matter whether the mark believes or doesn't, something most passionate hustlers despise, as they get their rocks off the (very limited, very narrow, and ultimately very unsatisfyingly crippled, but still -- it's all they got) personal interaction, the same thing I get naturally and in spades from my girls the passionate hustler gets torturously an' contortedly from his mark.</p>
<p>For another form, some derpy chick, too stupid to make it in, regaled us as part of her evening failure with a story to show that indeed her stupidity runs in the family. To wit, her brother, who (for some reason I've forgotten) had acquired a decent bundle of cabbage, got intercepted while walking downtown by some guy who "wanted to make friends", which (according to him) consists of "exchanging gifts" (really, the story ran like "let me give you my card, which gotta be in this black bag, that's how it's done around here"), thereupon turning into "a plainclothes detective with the vice squad" threatening to "arrest" the chump unless he surrender his wallet. Pressure hustle through and through, shy "engineer" kid couldn't tell some built dude to take a walk, and that's when the matter was decided.</p>

<p>They will, however, <em>often</em> pretend jealousy, <em>specifically because it empowers the woman</em>.

<blockquote><p>The moral being that society is not able to handle decisive people. It never was, it never will be, it simply can't. All that it can do is submit, trying its best to filter out and retouch the stronger contours wherever possible. In other words, society is the woman in the man-society relationship. If you let her make the rules she'll climb atop your head. If you go by what's coming out her mouth you'll end up drinkin tea in a miniskirt complete with stockings and garter belts. If on the other hand you grab her by the scruff of the neck and take her over the knee she'll happily suck your cock, glowing red butt and all. Basic stuff.</p></blockquote>
