<p style="text-align: right;"><em>With the auspicious help of the most competent <a href="http://thewhet.net/">hanbot</a>.</em></p>
<p>Right across a few cracks where some fickle grass grows and the wind smells slow-and-sour when it blows,<br />
Where no bird would sing nor doorbells could ring is the Street of the Old Lifted Lorax.</p>
<p>And deep in that grass, some people say, if you look close enough you can still see, today!<br />
Where the Lorax once stood just as long as it could before somebody lifted old Lorax away.</p>
<p>What was the Lorax? Any why was it there? And why was it lifted and taken somewhere ?</p>
<p>The crippled Ef-deer still lives there. Ask him. He knows.</p>
<p>You won't see the Ef-deer. Don't visit his cove. He stays in his Rosekim on top of his stove.<br />
He stays in his Rosekim, buried under his trove, his clothes made of moldy old muffles he wove.</p>
<p>But on special dank midnights in April he peeks out of the shutters, and sometimes he mutters.<br />
That's when he'll tell how it all went to hell.</p>
<p>He'll tell you, perhaps... if you're willing to pay.<br />
On the end of a rope he lets down a pail, wherein you must toss fifteen cents. And a nail.<br />
And the shell of a great-great-great-grandfather snail.</p>
<p>Then he pulls up the pail, makes a most careful count, to see if you've paid him the proper amount.<br />
Then he makes a note, and files it by rote, and constructs an elaborate Shrine of the Mote<br />
Then he hides what you paid him away in his Flue, his secret strange hole in his dubious pew.</p>
<p>Then he grunts: I will call you by Whisper-ma-Phone, for the secrets I'll tell are for your ears alone.</p>
<p>SCHLEP!</p>
<p>While the Whisper-ma-Phone schleps red files in your ear and the old Ef-deer's whispers are not very clear,<br />
Since they have to come down through a synergy hose, and he sounds as if he put things up in his nose.</p>
<p>Now I'll tell you, he'd say, with his teeth sounding gay, how the Lorax got lifted and taken away...<br />
It all started way back... such a long time ago... back when Queen Clover still had her chateau</p>
<p>When the turf was still green and the pond was still wet and the clouds were still clean, and when men could still bet.<br />
The morning I came to this glorious place and I first saw the trees! The Insurgency Trees! The bright campy fuzz of the Tammany Bees!</p>
<p>Pile after pile in the fresh morning breeze - out of piles of sleaze I made newspaper cheese<br />
While frisking about in their Bar-bar-loot suits spinstery codgers admired their boots<br />
As they swayed in the shade eating suede and grassroots.</p>
<p>From the purplulous pond came the comfortable sound of that menacing walrus named Wallace who drowned.<br />
But those trees! Those trees! Those tremulent trees! All my life I'd been searching for spirals like these.</p>
<p>The touch of their tufts was much softer than silk and they had the sweet smell of fresh butterfly milk.<br />
I felt a great leaping of joy in my heart. I knew just what I'd do! I unloaded my cart, let out a great fart,</p>
<p>In no time at all, I had built a small shop. Then I chopped down the unions in one single chop.<br />
And with great skillful skill and with great speedy speed, I knitted myself a mechanical steed.</p>
<p>The instant I'd finished, I heard a ga-Zump! I looked. I saw something pop out of my rump!<br />
It was... sort-of a mustardy Hun in a bun. How shall I describe him? That's hard, can't be done.</p>
<p>He was shortish. And borish. And brownish. And mossy.<br />
And he spoke with a voice that was sharpish and bossy.</p>
<p>Mister! he said with a sawdusty sneeze, I came as the Lorax. I'll eat all your cheese.<br />
I speak for the trees. Well...  some trees that could be. Maybe. I guess. Who's to say certainly ?</p>
<p>And I'm asking you, sir, at the top of my lungs-- he was very upset as he shouted in tongues--<br />
What's this THING you've made from the Insurgency spiel? Is it some sort of dubious, nutty new deal ?</p>
<p>Look! Lorax! I said. T'was no cause for alarm, just the tree I had chopped but that did no-one harm.<br />
I'm quite the utili-titarian tool, I keep all my nerves on this titty shaped spool.<br />
I've knitted myself a mechanical steed! A Very-Fine-Something-That-All-People-Need!</p>
<p>It's a shirt. It's a sock. It's a glove. It's a hat. It's a finely knit humectorheum at that!<br />
But it has other uses. Yes, far beyond that. You can use it for carpets. For pillows! For sheets!<br />
Or curtains! Or covers of bicycle seats! Or women, or even a new soundly beat.</p>
<p>The faux Lorax said, "Come then, hear the creed of the crazy, the lazy, the hastily freed :<br />
Hurr durr hurr, hurr durr jerbs! Hurr durr hurr, hurr durr weed!<br />
There is no one on earth who would buy that fool's steed!"</p>
<p>But the very next minute I proved he was wrong, for as it so happened a chap came along,<br />
And he thought that the steed I had knitted was great so he greedily bought it for three ninety-eight.</p>
<p>I laughed at the Lorax, at his faux feeble cry. For as clearly shown by one well chosen lie<br />
There's always a fool and there's no telling why or what any one fool might yet readily buy.</p>
<p>I repeat, cried the Lorax, -- I'm busy, I'm queasy, I'd much rather have a warm serving of peasy<br />
I rushed 'cross the room, and in no time at all knit a radio-phone. I put in a quick call.</p>
<p>I called all my brothers and uncles and aunts and I said, what the time and the country now wants<br />
Is the whole Ef-deer Family to get filthy rich! Get over here fast! Take the road to Ditch Nitch.<br />
Turn left at Weehawken! Sharp right at South Stich!</p>
<p>So in no time at all, in the factory I built, the whole Ef-deer Family was working full tilt.<br />
We were all knitting steeds, just as busy as bees, to the sound of the chopping of astroturfed trees.</p>
<p>Then... Oh! Baby! Oh! How my business did grow!</p>
<p>Now, chopping one tree at a time was too slow. So I quickly invented my Super-Axe-Hacker which whacked off four various trees at one smacker.<br />
We were making steeds four times as fast as before! And that true or faux Lorax?... Never saw him no more.</p>
<p>But the next week he knocked on my new office door. He snapped, I'm the Lorax who conjures the bees!<br />
Which you seem to be mixing up into your peas.</p>
<p>You remember the bees ? The once mighty Tammany bees ?</p>
<p>But I'm also in charge of the Brown Bar-bar-loots who played in the shade in their Bar-bar-loot suits<br />
Who are one and the same with the bees but distinct as a matter of law and district and precinct</p>
<p>Now...thanks to your hacking my trees to the ground, there's not enough fluffers and hash to go 'round.<br />
And my poor Bar-bar-loots are all getting the crummies because they have gas, 'stead o'food, in their tummies!</p>
<p>They loved living here. But I can't let them stay. They'll have to find food. And I hope that they may.<br />
Good luck, boys, he cried. And he sent them away. I, the Ef-deer, felt sad as I watched them all go.</p>
<p>BUT... business is business! And gubmint must grow! Regardless of crummies in tummies, you know.<br />
I meant no harm. I most truly did not. But I had to grow bigger. So bigger I grought.</p>
<p>I biggered my factory. I biggered my roads. I biggered my wagons. I buggered the toads<br />
All the steeds I shipped out, I was shipping them forth to the South! To the East! To the West! To the North!</p>
<p>I went right on biggering...selling more steeds. And I biggered my money, which everyone needs.<br />
Then again he came back! I was fixing some pipes when that old nuisance Lorax came back with more gripes.</p>
<p>I am the Lorax, he coughed and he whiffed. He sneezed and he snuffled. He snarggled. He sniffed.<br />
Ef-deer! he cried with a cruffulous croak. Ef-deer! You're making such smogulous smoke!</p>
<p>My poor Swomee-Swans...why, they can't sing a note! No one can sing who has smog in his throat.<br />
And so, said the Lorax, --please pardon my cough-- they cannot live here. So I'm sending them off.</p>
<p>Where will they go?... I don't hopefully know. They may have to fly for a month...or a year...<br />
To escape from the smog you've smogged-up around here. What's more, snapped the Lorax. (His dander was up.)</p>
<p>Let me say a few words about Gluppity-Glupp. Your machinery chugs on, day and night without stop<br />
making Gluppity-Glup. Also Schloppity-Schlopp. And what do you do with this leftover goo?...</p>
<p>I'll show you. You dirty old Ef-deer man, you! You're glumping the pond where the Humming-Fish hummed!<br />
No more can they hum, for their gills are all gummed. So I'm sending them off. Oh, their future is dreary.</p>
<p>They'll walk on their fins and get woefully weary in search of some water that isn't so smeary.<br />
And then I got mad. I got terribly mad. I yelled at the Lorax, Now listen here, Dad!</p>
<p>All you do is yap-yap and say, Bad! Bad! Bad! Bad! Well, I have my rights, sir, and I'm telling you<br />
I intend to go on doing just what I do! And, for your information, you Lorax, I'm figgering</p>
<p>on biggering and BIGGERING and BIGGERING  and BIGGERING,<br />
turning MORE various Trees into steeds which everyone, EVERYONE, EVERYONE needs!</p>
<p>And at that very moment, we heard a loud whack!<br />
From outside in the fields came a sickening smack of an axe on a tree. Then we heard the tree fall.<br />
The very last various Tree of them all!</p>
<p>No more trees. No more steeds. No more work to be done. So, in no time, my uncles and aunts, every one,<br />
All waved me good-bye. They jumped into my cars and drove away under the smoke-smuggered stars.</p>
<p>Now all that was left 'neath the bad-smelling sky was my big empty factory...</p>
<p>the Lorax...</p>
<p>and I.</p>
<p>The Lorax said nothing. Just gave me a glance... just gave me a very sad, sad backward glance... as he lifted himself by the seat of his pants.<br />
And I'll never forget the grim look on his face when he heisted himself and took leave of this place, through a hole in the smog, without leaving a trace.</p>
<p>And all that the Lorax left here in this mess was a small pile of rocks, with one word...</p>
<p>UNLESS.</p>
<p>Whatever that meant, well, I just couldn't guess. That was long, long ago. But each day since that day I've sat here and worried and worried away.</p>
<p>Through the years, while my buildings have fallen apart, I've worried about it with all of my heart.</p>
<p>But now, says the Ef-deer, now that you're here, the word of the Lorax seems perfectly clear.</p>
<p>UNLESS someone like you dies a whole awful lot, nothing's gonna get better.</p>
<p>It's not.</p>
<p>That's the end, said the Ef-deer, regarding askew all those piles of goop of the one thing he knew.<br />
And so here it ends, and that's that, and fuck you.</p>
