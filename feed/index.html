Meanwhile my writing was interrupted by the girls emerging from the other apartment (apartmently they weren't late, but since I was taking a nap they had retired discreetly &#038; on tiptoes). I had no idea they were even on the grounds! 
Anyway, so the steak of game that had been [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OTgyMDQ4MzEzODR8MjAxLjIwNi4xOTEuOTI=Authority. As it is sadly the case with pretty much all dumbphone games, there exists absolutely nothing out there discussing them in any terms befitting a human being. 
There's an abundance of "overviews" published, which all to the last one consist of a paragraph or two worth of meaningless word salad (which the inset to [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OTgyMDQ4MzEzODR8MjAxLjIwNi4xOTEuOTI=Monica Vitti is definitely the revelation of L'altra metà del cielo. The construction of her character's hopelessly successful attempts at reconciling reality and "ideals" (aka boyish nonsense) is sublimely maternal (in the best sense of that term -- not deliberately but misfortunately, miserere eis), to the point of actually functioning as an icon for the [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OTgyMDQ4MzEzODR8MjAxLjIwNi4xOTEuOTI=The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz tells the story of the post-War "New" Bureaucrat. Obviously the young shit on the make is not that new ; kids with a lot of ambition and very little anything else have been pouring out of cunt ever since it was invented, and in diluvional over-abundance.
