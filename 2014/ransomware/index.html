<p>There's no end to the idiots. There isn't going to ever be an end to the idiots : <a href="http://trilema.com/2013/the-story-of-pointless-and-witless/">their mother is perpetually pregnant</a>. So instead of hewing and hawing on "how to fix" the "problem" and similar bullshit, let me rehash an older point :</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://btcbase.org/log/?date=28-05-2014#692542">princessnell</a>: so MP are u sad that u can't attend any awesome btc conferences now that andreas' army is flexing their harrassment policy against yr triggering statements??<br />
davout: some of my homophobes are friends best<br />
mircea_popescu: princessnell, no because if i went to such a thing i'd get a set of bodyguards anyway. because you see, irrespective of what the crowd of nobody thinks, rich people sitll can't simply leave the door open relying on some sort of universal humanity. and so since i'm paying for security detail anyway, might as well put this to use : let them do the same if they want to talk to me on equal terms.<sup><a href="#footnote_3_55159" id="identifier_3_55159" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Speaking of which, time to do away with the ridiculous theory that a lord's guards are somehow inferior to the police. A policeman should know better than to get involved with the armed retinue of a lord, and if he doesn't he should be taught, in the manner the mob is ever taught : through shooting him, and anyone else that has a problem with this.
Maybe at some point in the past it was the case for all of five minutes that the democratic police could be relied on to protect, and so it made sense for the lords to not use armed retinues, nor to enforce their superiority over the popular guards. But that time's long gone, if indeed it ever existed.">iv</a></sup> sensible n'est pas.</p>
<p>princessnell: good bc those are some tuff dudes<br />
davout: s/n'est pas/n'est-ce pas/<br />
mircea_popescu: mine works too omg hateur</p>
<p>davout: yes, if you're a drunk master yoda. sensible, cela n'est pas</p></blockquote>
<p>That's exactly right : there's nothing wrong with raping, pillaging or killing poor people.<sup><a href="#footnote_4_55159" id="identifier_4_55159" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="There is something wrong with trying it on rich people : they'll probably strike back.">v</a></sup> Not because they would do the same to you, but because <em>they do</em>, they actually already do the same to you.<sup><a href="#footnote_5_55159" id="identifier_5_55159" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Take progressive tax as a fine example. It's not that `some` are `trying`. All are trying, and some are occasionally succeeding.
And before we revisit that tired old strawman about how `not all poor people are evil, and so the killing of poor people is not morally justified per se` : they may not all be evil, but I don't kill poor people all the time either. They're not all evil, and I don't spend my entire day in the poor people abattoir. So we're even then : I kill them sometimes, they're evil sometimes. Exact match.">vi</a></sup></p>
<p>So... let the carnage begin. Why solve ecology problems at the wrong end ? Just butcher the mob. Nobody said we're all equally people. We aren't. We'll never be. Do something useful, do something pleasant or do your final prayers. It's only natural, after all.</p>
