<p><strong>Master</strong><br />
<blockquote>Fourth: she misunderstood/completely understood his answer about whether the magazine was particularly masculine: "It's called The Economist." Uh oh. If I ask, "Is Cosmo Magazine particularly feminine?" and you reply, "Duh, stupid, it's called Cosmo, any more feminine and it would have a tailbone tattoo," then you are implying not only that the magazine is feminine, but that I should have been able to infer that because cosmos are feminine. To him, The Economist is masculine is because economics is intrinsically masculine-- and she implicitly accepts this. Now who's the sexist? Whose theoretical daughters have a better chance of learning economics? Of course she'd say any women can learn economics, yay women, but her daughters would be learning a masculine discipline, see also math, which I predict she's bad at. The barrier is in herself, sexism is merely her projection of it.</p>
<p>So while she pretends that it is the male perspective she doesn't like, it is evident that it's the contents themselves that she objects to. They're boring, but that can't be related to intellectual curiosity because she's a thinker. So it has to be the "male perspective". But didn't the same male perspective write the takedowns and dissections? Books, sex, relationships; those are "inclusive to women". What happens when you don't sign up for NATO-- that's masculine. But is it? Really?</p>
<p>I agree that most of the articles in The Economist are boring and don't "relate" to my lifestyle as an alcoholic, but I force myself to go through them like social studies homework, and most of the women who do the same are doing it as the same. The articles aren't supposed to be interesting to me, they are supposed to be important and I force myself to be interested.</p></blockquote>
<p>There you go, the complete story of rape as required life experience. Girl says no fifty times and nobody cares. It's not her place to deny.<br />
<strong>slave</strong> Totally unrelated wtf. <a href=http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2014/05/cyberbll.html>The guy above</a> is making a persuasive argument as to the misplacement of the perception of sexism. This has no bearing on "rape" nor "saying no fifty times".<sup><a href="#footnote_0_55244" id="identifier_0_55244" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This was a real life event, yesterday.

<p><strong>Master</strong> "The articles aren't supposed to be interesting to me, they are supposed to be important and I force myself to be interested."<br />
<strong>slave</strong> Dude that's one person taking a stand against their own stupidity.</p>
<p><strong>Master</strong> Exactly.<br />
<strong>slave</strong> How does this translate into "nobody cares, it's not her place to deny" ?</p>
<p><strong>Master</strong> Directly! No translation needed even, it is exactly the same thing.<br />
<strong>slave</strong> No dude, there's an extremely important difference at work here. In the source material, someone is recognizing this FOR THEMSELVES and is doing something about it. In your conclusion, "the rest of the world" (implicit in "nobody") xyz.</p>
<p><strong>Master</strong> In the source, the rest of the world doesn't care. In my example, idem. In the source, the subject recognises this for himself. In my example, she does the same for herself. Or to quote, "I am a little sleepy but fine. I had a very pleasant time with you yesterday. Kisses,"</p>
<p>That's what it is, all of it. For all the pretense,  "getting students involved in their own training" is utter nonsense : in order to know what to learn you must already know what there is to learn. In order to know how to learn, you must know what ways to learn there are. These are supersets of the knowledge you don't have in the first place, and so it's plain impossible you'd have anything meaningful to say as to either what or how you should be learning. The most you can do, after having been <del datetime="2014-06-27T03:39:08+00:00">educated</del> raped, is picking the what and the how for other, later, virgins. Who in turn, irrespective of what they think they want and how they think they want it, will get whatever there's to get, exactly in the manner of getting it.</p>
<p>Do you know of a greater taboo than this banal observation ?</p>

						<p>Dude you have gone too far this time!</p>
<p>While it is often true that people simply do not know what they do not know and are thus in no position to make a proper judgment about it, this situation is by no means universal.</p>
<p>I do not need to eat a bowl of shit to know I do not want to eat a bowl of shit, like wise I do not need to have been physically assaulted to know that I do not wish to be physically assaulted. There is no gain for me, or for society in general, to allow physical assault repeatedly. This is not the same thing as reading potentially boring text with the possibility of improving my mind.</p>

						<p>What I take from the article is along the lines of this: </p>
<p>You can't teach a bird to fly, nor does it need you to, nor does anyone care to. Any attempt toward such is merely a communication/social feedback loop from which there can be no measurable result other than submission to the oppression of the attemptors/attemptees to remain within the loop and within that ideal. </p>
<p>Such a feedback loop is fine, for as long as it is fine, but the loop has no way to know if it still ideal until it is broken.</p>

						<p>@ThickAsThieves<br />
I would go further in that you cannot teach anyone/anything that has not chosen to learn. You can put that boring article in front of someone forever but you can not make them read it, even less make them learn from having read.<br />
This is still all about choice.</p>
<p>Physical assault has nothing to do with choice. I do not need to lose a leg to learn it is better to have two.</p>

						<p>@Chett No, but you would need to lose a leg to learn that having one may have actually been better for you, in your particular life, for some random reason. And this is a thing you cannot know, being two-legged n all. Maybe one-leg-you discovers a breakthrough in prosthesis and successfully legitimizes polygamy in the Western world. (I'm just playing along here, not very seriously).</p>
<p>Two-legged you is so boring!</p>

<blockquote><p>Dude you have gone too far this time!</p></blockquote>
<p>Kind-of my job, I'd say.</p>
<blockquote><p>While it is often true that people simply do not know what they do not know and are thus in no position to make a proper judgment about it, this situation is by no means universal.</p></blockquote>
<p>What do you mean it's not universal ? All people all the time and everywhere know not what they don't know, by the definition of "knowing" and "what". It's quite universal.</p>
<blockquote><p>I do not need to eat a bowl of shit to know I do not want to eat a bowl of shit</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a different situation : you beg the question by proposing you already know what a bowl of shit is, then suggest that you don't know <em>what you know</em> and yet looky that you know it. What if you earnestly imagined "a bowl of shit" is how you say strawberries, because you live in a clime without them and someone had played a cruel joke ? Someone you love not for any personal reason, but <a href=http://trilema.com/2014/the-problem-of-enforcement/#footnote_0_55204 >merely because that's how it goes</a>, like say your mother ? That <em><a href=http://trilema.com/2011/oricine-poate-sa/ >mula</a></em> of your mother ?</p>
<blockquote><p>I do not need to have been physically assaulted to know that I do not wish to be physically assaulted</p></blockquote>
<p>You are currently being physically assaulted by a column of air delivering about 10 N of force per every square centimenter of your skin. This is generally more force than you'll experience in any other situation, and so what of it ? For one thing, without it you'll wither away.</p>
<p>You may say it's okay because that's somehow unintentional, ie, impersonal, but that's quite problematic : bunches of assaults are perpetrated by squarely insane, and thus impersonal agressors. The proper approach is to observe that it's natural, or in other words <em>proper</em>. That there exist proper assaults, such as teaching a third year old to brush her teeth whether she wants to or not.</p>
<blockquote><p>or for society in general</p></blockquote>
<p>Society in general don't enter into it, it's a fiction.</p>
<blockquote><p>reading potentially boring text</p></blockquote>
<p>So if the text is boring who's to blame ? The text ?</p>
<p>That's fine, but if the lives of most US citizens today are empty who's to blame, Life ? Lyf ?</p>

<blockquote><p>You can’t teach a bird to fly, nor does it need you to, nor does anyone care to. Any attempt toward such is merely a communication/social feedback loop from which there can be no measurable result other than submission to the oppression of the attemptors/attemptees to remain within the loop and within that ideal. </p></blockquote>
<p>While that's not all that's there, it definitely is in there. I can readily undersign on that interpretation.</p>
<p>@<b>Charlie Bucket</b> Unfortunately, I'm not. Nice to meet you tho.</p>
<p>Such a feedback loop is fine, for as long as it is fine, but the loop has no way to know if it still ideal until it is broken.</p>
<p>@<b>Chett</b> How do you chose to learn ? So she's not run off, has she chosen to learn ? Suppose she fails to overcome the training cage, is this her choice to learn then ? </p>
<blockquote><p>you can not make them read it</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes you can. You beat them until they to. They will. They like to claim that they would not, they like to gather in groups and clamour that you "should" not. That all aside, the nude fact of the matter is that yes, they will. Children are born cowardly for a reason, much like girls are born curious for a reason.</p>
<p>The only way they could be able to resist is, amusingly, if they had already learned, a better text. That's roughly the story of the Christian oppression of the Jews : they managed to run the Inca and the Aztecs into the dirt, because both these tribes had shit for texts. They didn't manage to drive the Jews into the dirt, in spite of trying for longer and being in a better position to, because the Jews had pretty decent texts.</p>
<p>At any rate : physical assault is the only place where choice is meaningful. What has nothing to do with choice is the supermarket. The French call it "l'embarras du choix."</p>

						<p>@<b>ThickAsThieves</b> No, the thing there is to notice that it's really not the case that you don't know what not having a leg is like. </p>
<p>@<b>Chett</b> That's dangerous a proposition, because a) nine out of ten people have a great time at a gangbang and b) the point of civilisation is to have conflicts resolved by appeal to uninvolved third parties, rather than by the parties involved. As such, civilisation itself is predicated on the notion that people with no personal experience with rape will not only be discussing it, but, centrally, will be deciding it for those involved.</p>

						<p>Perhaps a bit less civilization is in order.</p>
<p>Whereas the 3 year old can be assumed to know/understand less about the care of teeth than the adult attempting to teach we can not assume that the raper knows/understands anything more about sex/assault than the rapee.</p>
<p>A woman that does not fight a rapist is much more likely to survive the incident with minimal injury, this does not make grandmas advice to 'close your eyes and pretend its not happening' any more proper.</p>

						<p>Why does she want to survive it at all, and who said her desire to survive also gives her some sort of right to live in a world that works "exactly like the real world, except for the part where she'll do anything to survive" ?</p>
<p>Sure, we can have a convention to this effect. It's merely a convention, such as the convention to the effect that a magical unicorn in the sky known as "social security" will make everyone comfortable in their need. Sometimes it works.</p>

						<p>Fact remains that women do fight. Even with the knowledge that the act may well cost them their life.<br />
This is not some sort of strange fantasy. Survival is not always the ultimate goal for a human being.<br />
I am not claiming any sort of right for either the raper or the rapee.<br />
You however seem to claim that the raper has some sort of right. Like the woman has a cunt so he is entitled to use it.</p>

						<p>To borrow from Andreas and his "blockchain technology" phrase,  rape and who did what to whom is a problem that rapechain technology can solve. If a group of men have consensus, is the woman on a forked rapechain? No-one is going to accept her alternate rapechain on the main rapechain ledger so she must submit. Her memory of the event will serve as a full rapechain node, no doubt she'll tell everyone anyway.</p>

She has to ask her husband, and where is he going, and who's he going with and are the parents going to be there. It's a wonder the kid doesn't go "eh fuck this stupid shit, I'm taking the lawn mower, riding it all the way there like a baws". It's a wonder he doesn't go all Ken Park on her dumb ass, and here's another thing : if I were in a jury asked to convict the kid after he had impaled her on a rusted fuckstick and left her to die there, I would get that kid off the hook, jury nullificationii if necessary, but I'd get him off.
