<p>As you perhaps heard, MtGox collapsed. Let us quote : </p>
<blockquote><p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> O look at that, Luke-Jr needs to learn to listen to MP.<br />
<strong>Luke-Jr</strong> Why?</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Because you'd still have 70% of your savings, that's why.<sup><a href="#footnote_0_53016" id="identifier_0_53016" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="His own numbers, I make no representation of accuracy.">i</a></sup><br />
<strong>Luke-Jr</strong> I didn't know you had access to MtGox's code</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> There's a lot of things you didn't know. But the fact that I said mtgox is going down, you knew. Next time, listen. It's not like it's coming out of my pocket if you don't, you know ?<br />
<strong>Luke-Jr</strong> Oh, so I'm supposed to just believe everything you say but can't/won't provide evidence for?</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Nope. You're supposed to listen to it. There's a fucking difference.<br />
<strong>Luke-Jr</strong> If I knew it, then I must have listened to you say it. </p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Notrly.<br />
<strong>Luke-Jr</strong> And thought you were full of crap since you couldn't substantiate it.</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Yeah well, see, that's a broken implication there. Or two. However you count.<sup><a href="#footnote_1_53016" id="identifier_1_53016" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="For the slow : `Won't` does not map neatly to `couldn't`. `Won't do what we ask for` does not map neatly to `full of crap`, `asshole`, `evil`, `male chauvinist pig`, `racis`, `psychopath`, or whatever other linguistic convention you're familiar and comfortable with.">ii</a></sup><br />
<strong>Luke-Jr</strong> Did *you* steal the bitcoins?<sup><a href="#footnote_2_53016" id="identifier_2_53016" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="You gotta love it when the lamers are being edgy and everything.

Sucks that reality doesn't work the same way cinematic renditions of reality work huh.">iii</a></sup><br />
<strong>Apocalyptic</strong> Heh.</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> If we had the luxury of discarding anything of reality that doesn't conveniently fit with our theoretical system, we wouldn't for instance be stuck with quantum mechanics. Newtonian physics'd have been just fine.<br />
<strong>Luke-Jr</strong> Because right now, it sounds like you're implicitly confessing.<sup><a href="#footnote_3_53016" id="identifier_3_53016" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This is fundamentally what the fundamentalist mind does, whether religious or not. Did our `god-inspired` diets kill our wife ? Clearly she was burdened by sin.">iv</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> No, it just sounds like you still have issues listening. I get that you're very emotionally invested in this "master of all i survey" nonsense, but that's not how reality works.<sup><a href="#footnote_4_53016" id="identifier_4_53016" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Depends for whom, in truth. It's not how it works for the 99%.">v</a></sup><br />
<strong>Luke-Jr</strong> the only way to know MtGox was going down like this, is if you had evidence, or you were behind it. And you clearly did not have evidence.</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Lmao! Because why. Because I live in Luke-Jr world, where if Luke-Jr asks I am forced to comply ?<sup><a href="#footnote_5_53016" id="identifier_5_53016" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="More on this topic in a coupla days. I promise it'll be good.">vi</a></sup><br />
<strong>Apocalyptic</strong> Having evidence is different from diclosing it<br />
<strong>Luke-Jr</strong> Apocalyptic: yes, but mircea_popescu is generally clueless too<sup><a href="#footnote_6_53016" id="identifier_6_53016" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="For the record, let us explore the difference between a man too stupid to qualify as a boy and a boy doing a decent job of posing as a man :

">vii</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> I guess 30% of your savings is too much for you huh. Aite, carry on.<br />
<strong>Luke-Jr</strong> Just because you're right for once in your life, does not mean you will be right ever again.</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Apparently your one-bit counter is well smashed. Add some overflow control there.</p></blockquote>
<p>That was yesterday. As perhaps you've heard, overnight the Cyprus government collapsed and BFL disappeared. Let us <a href="http://trilema.com/forum-logs-for-07-nov-2013#955024">further quote</a> : </p>
<blockquote><p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Anyway, let's pull a little chain here. Hey Luke-Jr, how about that BFL ? (You know you're going on the list of accessories for that prosecution, right ?) Better spend the 30% left of those savings and anything you can borrow to retain counsel now, before the freeze orders start raining down. You'll need all the help you can get propping up the "ignorant idiot without a clue" defense.<br />
<strong>ThickAsThieves</strong> So BFL never shipped those PCI boards that were guaranteed for X-mas deliver? Color me serbprized.</p></blockquote>
<p>It doesn't take a genius to figure out exactly what's going on in Bitcoin these days, especially seeing how what's going on in Bitcoin these days is being live-blogged by the sovereign doing it. Nevertheless... check this out :</p>

<p>This would be the difference between actual power and pretend-power, claimants to power, defeated Byzantines clinging on to the shreds and shards of shattered power : when MP hides the explanation of what sunk MtGox in plain sight, it's hidden. You're more than welcome to stand on your head, do cartwheels, whatever suits you. Powerlessness, that's what it is : the inability to alter the workings of power. On the other hand, when investigative agent <a href="http://trilema.com/forum-logs-for-20-feb-2014#1101561">tries it</a>, he gets made within six hours.</p>
