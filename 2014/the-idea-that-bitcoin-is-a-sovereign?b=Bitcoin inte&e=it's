It is also not very much of an idea : every one year old enters into this world with the firm conviction that it - fleshy, flubbery worm devoid of any power, ability or knowledge - is nevertheless an independent, sovereign entity the world exists to serve. </p>
<p>The implementation of the idea that Bitcoin is a sovereign as a practical matter, however, is both novel and, at least so far, my own<sup><a href="#footnote_0_54390" id="identifier_0_54390" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="That statement stands quite exactly as strong as all that : I am the only one who has done anything whatsoever on this score so far.

That aside, I wouldn't mind no longer being the only one, for sure, and I certainly don't mind bright young things that forge ahead on the strength of their purity of conviction. It's fun.
Yet as far as the other side is concerned, that dark, ugly, filthy side : while you're derping about how you've `lobbyied` for Bitcoin, think of simple things : MP said Bitcoin is not a currency in 2012. Notwithstanding all your derpage, in 2014 this was confirmed by the supposed authorities you were supposedly lobbying, with your entirely self-supposed importance. What gives ?
None of this to in any way diminish the simple and hopefully obvious fact that without Satoshi, this entire discussion would never have happened.

Unlike Bitcoin, both states collectively and the people making them up individually are entities, and as such they can do or not do things. One thing states can do is add Bitcoin to the list of their enemies. Another thing states can do is avoid populating their list of enemies with things that aren’t entities, for the very simple reason that nobody’s yet won the pissing in the wind and staying dry competition. One thing people can do is support states. Another thing people can do is not support states. In most cases this is statistically based on the list of enemies of each state, and their respective strength. For instance, not many people were supporting the American Confederacy a few years back.
As far as experience shows, people don’t tend to support states that either stupidly or unwittingly include rules among their enemies. You can’t win a war against math, or against drugs, or against “social injustice”, or “kulaks”. Soon after the Soviet government moved its focus from entities to rules, it lost the support of the people. Soon after the other-Soviet government moved its focus from entities to rules, it also lost the support of the people. There weren’t that many people burning American flags in 1860, you know ? Why do you think not ? You can support a government killing Indians, or bison. You can’t support a government fighting chemical compounds.
Seeing how that other-Soviet government is already widely engaged in a battle with the rules of the world it inhabits, it seems generally a waste of time to stop and consider what it does or doesn’t do, whom it classifies as what and all that jazz. Its days are numbered. The people currently supporting it are likely to - on average - survive longer than it.

Nothing in the world.
From the official record of all Bitcoin things : 
mircea_popescu BOMBSHELL: Snowden downloaded entire roster of U.S. government - all names, home addresses and other personal info of **all** officials and gov't employees -- including law enforcement -- plus bankers, corporate boards of directors and more!
mircea_popescu bwahaha
KRS-One omg wow
mircea_popescu next step : Bitcoin regulates the USG.
mircea_popescu `Remember : we know where YOU live.`
And what was that heartbleed thing ?
mircea_popescu If spending money solved problems the phoenician empire'd still be a thing. Nobody is denying a lot of smart people work for the NSA. Heck, a lot of smart people worked for Microsoft, and Alcatel, and whatever other pointless dinosaur. Adobe. That does not make Adobe smart. Not at all. For all the brilliant Russians living in the 70s, the USSR was dumb as rocks.
bounce Yeah, but we're not talking NSA as a whole. We're talking the stuff that comes out of there in the form of algorithms
mircea_popescu It's not clear why this reclassification'd be useful to your position.
Apocalyptic `Best guess (last I heard) was that they're about five years ahead of the open community with the research` that may have been accurate a few years ago. I don't believe it's the case nowadays.
mircea_popescu It was perhaps accurate in the 90s.
Apocalyptic Sounds reasonable.
mircea_popescu As the things stand right now, they never had an internal Bitcoin, and we wiped their heartbleed. And while we know what they don't know, they don't know what we know. Which... you know.
">v</a></sup>. </p>
<p>It's not the writing, it's not a matter of speech, all this. It's the doing, it's a matter of deeds.</p>
<p>It's that when confronted with the demands of an agency of the US Government, <a href="http://trilema.com/2014/interacting-with-fiat-institution-a-guide/">I made the recognition of Bitcoin's sovereignity</a> a <em>sine qua non</em> condition of further dialogue. It's nothing else and nothing short of that : in order for any portion of the USG to discuss any matter with France or any portion thereof, the US must first recognise France <em>as an equal</em>. </p>
<p>Identically, exactly identically, in order for any portion of any one government to discuss any matter that has anything to do with Bitcoin, that government will have to recognise Bitcoin.<sup><a href="#footnote_5_54390" id="identifier_5_54390" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Obviously when confronted with such `impossible`  standards, the powers that think they be would rather cut a deal with their own plants, the scam masquerading as `Bitcoin Foundation`, the powerfully retarded rangers, whoever. 
The problem with this approach is that the plants have no mandate. They represent no one, they carry no weight, it's quite like negotiating with Taiwan and pretending to bind China. Pompous claims notwithstanding, nobody in China actually cares what Taiwan thinks on any topic. 
Meanwhile back at reality ranch, everything is impossible until it happens. What, was it impossible to have a black US president ? What exactly is impossible, a Thracian Emperor of Rome ? Mixed race marriage ? A world going about its business squarely disinterested in the opinions of the priesthood ? Nothing is ever impossible.

<p>Because of such things, and plenty of other similar things, when small companies are confronted with the problem of a broken legal system<sup><a href="#footnote_10_54390" id="identifier_10_54390" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="From Timothy B. Lee's How a rogue appeals court wrecked the patent system :
Research would eventually find that by the turn of the century, patent litigation had become so expensive that the patent system was actually acting as a net disincentive to innovation outside of the pharmaceutical industry. The same researchers estimated that patent trolls cost the economy between $29 billion and $83 billion per year.
[...]
For example, when we interviewed Paul Michel, who served as the Federal Circuit's chief judge from 2004 to 2010, he didn't seem to understand the problems facing small software companies. `If software is less dependent on patents, fine then. Let software use patents less as they choose,` he said, seemingly oblivious to the fact that software companies don't have the option to opt out of patent troll lawsuits.
">xi</a></sup> Bitcoin can make a very simple statement : MPEx doesn't recognise patent claims. Register your company on MPEx, as a Bitcoin corporation, you're immune to that gunk.</p>
<p>It's something. </p>
<p>Contrary to how it may appear to you, it's something very big, and very important. It's not merely change : it's fundamental change for the better principles. Something anyone can fight against, but something no one can ever win against. Even should everyone fight against it.</p>

[<a href="#identifier_9_54390" class="footnote-link footnote-back-link">&#8617;</a>]</li><li id="footnote_10_54390" class="footnote">From <a href="https://trilema.com/binarybits" rel="nofollow">Timothy B. Lee</a>'s <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/09/how-a-rogue-appeals-court-wrecked-the-patent-system/">How a rogue appeals court wrecked the patent system</a> :</p>
<blockquote><p>Research would eventually find that by the turn of the century, patent litigation had become so expensive that the patent system was actually acting as a net disincentive to innovation outside of the pharmaceutical industry. The same researchers estimated that patent trolls cost the economy between $29 billion and $83 billion per year.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>For example, when we interviewed Paul Michel, who served as the Federal Circuit's chief judge from 2004 to 2010, he didn't seem to understand the problems facing small software companies. "If software is less dependent on patents, fine then. Let software use patents less as they choose," he said, seemingly oblivious to the fact that software companies don't have the option to opt out of patent troll lawsuits.</p></blockquote>

						<p>Bitcoin isn't sovereign without privacy. We can post on this blog through Tor but I doubt we can do this on your irc chatroom, much like bitcoin-otc. So many websites with cryptocurrency stuff are behind the Great Flarewall (cloudflare).  Perhaps you have Bitcoin confused with Ethereum; now with ring signatures and every imaginable elf cloaking magic in the works (see my name's link)! Although they don't seem to be developing Whisper at present.</p>

						<p>There can be no sovereignity WITH privacy, the two are contrary notions. The surest sign of the slave that knows himself a slave is that he seeks <a href=http://trilema.com/2012/anonimity-or-the-urban-versus-rural-dispute/ >anonimity</a>.</p>

						<p>...ergo anonymity made him a slave?</p>
<p>You had that incident with the SEC. I guess you must not be in their ("sovereign") jurisdiction but in any event Tor + ethereum contract would be a lot closer to sovereign than your little mom and pop operation could ever be.</p>

						<p>I'm not seeing the contradiction. I'm wearing your outfit, how does it look on me? Men are forbidden in these lands, Sir. Unless all it means is having a trunk. We've gotten off the topic. Ladies have a higher tolerance for pain. That is the prerequisite for being a sovereign like the one they hung on a tree. You can feel all free and powerful when you are negotiating what medicine you can have. I think we aren't quite there yet but we are only a few autononmous agents away.</p>
