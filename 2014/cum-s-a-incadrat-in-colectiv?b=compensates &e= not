<p>Do not panic, we're still doing English.</p>
<p>The question in the title is based on a Romanian construction created by and forgotten with the Romanian rendition of communism. They had a special language you see, called <em>limba de lemn</em> (ie wooden tongue). It was stylistically rather balanced and in many ways linguistically superior to the Romanian currently spoken in the press and on the street, but nevertheless also rather rigid and for most folks unwieldy to use<sup><a href="#footnote_0_53431" id="identifier_0_53431" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The proper form of mentioning Romania's last communist dictator, Nicky C, would have been `Tovarăşul Nicolae Ceauşescu, secretar general al Partidului Comunist Român, preşedintele Consiliului de Stat al Republicii Socialiste România`. That's like 50 syllables right there.">i</a></sup>.</p>
<p>As part of it, "<em>a se incadra</em>" is a reflexive<sup><a href="#footnote_1_53431" id="identifier_1_53431" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Verbs that take an object but no agent (ie, something suffers the action described, but nobody actually does it, like is the case of `to rain`) are called intransitive. Verbs that take an object and an agent (like `to fuck` : somebody is doing the fucking, and somebody is being fucked - there's nothing symmetrical about sex) are called transitive. Verbs for which the agent is always also the object are called reflexive. This category does not exist in English, for which structural lack the pigdin in question compensates by abusing the pronoun (`go fuck yourself`). And since we're on this topic : see also The linguistic mark of cultural failure.">ii</a></sup> verb which comes from the ancient latin for "square", and denotes the action or ability of becoming part of a prestructured set without significantly altering its structure. It was limited to a few uses over its short and mostly unhappy lifetime : one contemporary (with communist Romania) use would be "<em>a se incadra in trafic</em>", which roughly dealt with the activity described by the English "merging" (in trafic). Another, mostly post-communist<sup><a href="#footnote_2_53431" id="identifier_2_53431" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="It was possibly used to some degree pre-Revolution, too, but at the time budgets were not of particular concern, which is what happens in socialism once the currency is destroyed by inept policy. The exact situation is replayed by the US as we speak, in fact I would say politically speaking the US is just about to reach the maturity displayed by Romania cca 1967. Maturity in the sense of cheese, obviously, we're discussing socialism and therefore putrefaction over here.">iii</a></sup>, "<em>a se incadra in buget</em>", which'd mean to fit (or moreover be fittable) within a given budget. They're both mostly forgotten today, outside of the edge cases where someone tries really hard to appear formal.<sup><a href="#footnote_3_53431" id="identifier_3_53431" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This is a big issue with Romanians still. Consider this guy for instance : he is trying to explain that a piece of the gutter fell off, but because he's doing it on TV he perceives he needs to beef the formal up, which happens to be something he has not much practice with and no clear recollection of. Consequently his verbiage sounds quite schizoid.">iv</a></sup></p>
<p>The other part, "colectiv" denotes the <em>genus loci</em> perceived by Romanians to exist in any place inhabited. This was primitively assigned by the communists to "the group" of people with no futher ado, so any class of school children<sup><a href="#footnote_4_53431" id="identifier_4_53431" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Unlike the (boneheaded) US model where the teacher owns the classroom and the students rove from one to the next, school in Romania consisted much more appropriately of the class owning the classroom and the teachers roving from one to the next. It would seem that moving one person being cheaper than moving thirty has somehow escaped our (very liberal, n'est pas) friends in the colonies.">v</a></sup> and any group of workers (inasmuch as they ordinarily worked in the same hall) made up a "collective". Careful reconstruction of intension by examination of praxis readily shows that there is no substantial communist contribution here, but merely an ancient concept (in fact, again, as old as the Romans) has been misappropriated for modern usage.</p>
<p>So, "<em>a se incadra in colectiv</em>" would denote the ability and the practice of becoming part of an established social group without altering its hierarchy or modes and mechanisms of functioning. This works on the ancient political (polity-cal ?) strictures of "does not upset the laws of the gods" (as opposed to you know, the laws of men) and is in a sense social weightlessness, the mark of inexistence : one who readily <em>incadra</em>tes himself in any collective would necessarily be a bland, boring <del datetime="2014-03-19T11:45:17+00:00">lion tamer</del> accountant. As such, "<em>nu s-a incadrat in collectiv</em>" quickly became the polite expression of rejection and the lowest level of employee delinquency. Why has Bob been fired from your company ? Well... nothing specific, but he sucks.</p>
<p>The pressure to "meld into the collective"<sup><a href="#footnote_5_53431" id="identifier_5_53431" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="An awful translation, as it connotes way too much zergism than the original we're translating. That's the problem with words in different languages : even if what they denote may sometimes match (allegedly), what they connote never ever will. Except for the times when it does, for absolutely no good reason, just to troll.">vi</a></sup> was generally strongest upon young children, who were expected, as part of the normal development of the intellect around the age of nine or ten, to become able to function within a group. </p>
<p>Older children and young adults actually individuated as resolution of the implicit conflict here : obviously not all people can work in all groups. Yet one has to!<sup><a href="#footnote_6_53431" id="identifier_6_53431" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="To better understand that has to, have you seen The Caine Mutiny ?

GEORGE: Then I see my clothes floating out there. The tied took them out, not the kids.

					<p>[...] Yes, that's right -- if you're 25 and haven't yet lived with -- I don't mean "drunken brawled", once. I don't mean any of the other dumb bullshit you plebs do to "substitute" for the necessary achievements incumbent in the unfolding of life. I mean quite exactly lived for -- you're retarded, just like any other booger-eating, spittle-dribbling mongoloid. The difference, if there's a difference, if anyone can be bothered to look for such things as a difference, will come out as a matter of degree. It will not be a matter of kind, because there's not two kinds. Retards are retards, broken sub-humans, they don't make the cut and that's that. It don't specifically matter if the other's 55 or 39, but it does matter they're twice your age, give or take. It does matter that the retarded adults around you "would never approve" and the immature girlies about "don't understand how you can". You'd better fucking well can, because as the men used to point out to each other all the time (back when some could still be found) : you either do what's to be done or you're no good. [...]</p>
