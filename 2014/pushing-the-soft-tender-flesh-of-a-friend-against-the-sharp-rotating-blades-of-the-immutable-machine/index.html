<p>You know I'm just the guy to do it, so here goes : </p>
<p><strong>asciilifeform</strong> Still boggling mind at the newest pgp hatchet job<sup><a href="#footnote_0_56091" id="identifier_0_56091" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="It was linked in the logs (multiple times, I'm not even the last one) to much delight.">i</a></sup>. Why the idiocy? or rather, why was it not cushioned in perfectly logical criticism of the spec (crufty<sup><a href="#footnote_1_56091" id="identifier_1_56091" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Nobody seriously argues that part, crufty it is.">ii</a></sup>; mandates support for hideously weak algos; etc) ? Almost enough to believe that the author is secretly on the side of the forces of good - i.e. he isn't genuinely trying to fool anyone. Like the mythical einsatzgruppen kommando loading blank shells.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Because they can't afford to pay smart people enough.<sup><a href="#footnote_2_56091" id="identifier_2_56091" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="You can't begin to properly appreciate this problem, as you're sitting in your chair currently. Consider, how much would you have to pay your wife to do the things the girls do in porn movies ? 
It's not about plain, first layer stuff like taking your and your best friends' penis in the asshole ; or spending the day naked at a non-nudist beach where random people take turns pissing on her. Like any plain, first layer stuff this can always be done. Buy a length of chain, hire some people to loudly brandy about machine guns or planks with a nail, it can be done, it won't even cost very much. (Yes, yes, I know, this is not stuff you want or would ever do. Nobody cares about you, we're not discussing your all important snowflake of a personality here, we're discussing reality, which is a wide band even if your head is narrow. So take a back seat.) 
It's about the second layer stuff : having her do all that and love it, have her do all that and rush back for more, have her do all that and then call you eighteen times Thursday to make sure she'll be included in the weekend's festivities (What do you mean nothing's happening this weekend! God help you, man) and try and divine what exactly is on the menu and try and ensure that it'll be even more than last time! Much, much more! Please.
So go over, look at the woman, come back and come up with a figure. How much money ?
But it's not money, now is it. Not all the money in the world could compensate for proper training, for that proper placement of heart and mind that wins battles. Battles, plural, with a view towards `any`. No abundance of materiel can make a bunch of ADD-addled transvestite videogamers win a war, because wars are won by actual men, as wars always have been won by men. War never changes, and ADD, transvestitism and escapism are each individually great negative predictors of manhood. (And speaking of which...)
So no, the current USG can never pay the people that are any good enough. Ever. No matter how much it borrows and spends, never could it have enough. The reason is quite exactly the same as the reason your wife will never take two dicks to the asshole or tan her skin that other way at the beach. That reason is that these are fundamentally different worlds, and each whole, complete worlds at that. (The misguided notion that `anyone could be a whore` is addressed here, by the way.) It takes a lot of training, and a lot of talent and actual interest on the part of the subject to become that good a slut. All this takes time. Time that your wife didn't spend this way. She didn't run off with the circus when she was 13 to show everyone her only pubic hair at the time. She didn't spend every waking hour behind the cameras on porn sets when she was a well used 16 yo tramp, watching enraptured every drop of the action. It's just not her thing, she didn't put the time into it, she's not into it, she'll never be any good at it. Maybe she'll be good at other things, but generally speaking, you don't ask the doctor why he isn't a great lawyer and similarly you don't ask your wife why she isn't a great whore.
This is how it goes for all people that are good at things : becoming good at anything whatsoever is all about discrimination : this is right, that is wrong. Jimmy is doing it correctly, Johnny is doing it wrongly. Mary is a smart cookie, Imani is a fucktard. To become good at anything whatsoever you absolutely require a hierarchy, based on oppression of Imanis and Johnnys, and on discrimination against their actions, beliefs and opinions. A hierarchy to indicate who are the masters, and the experts, from whom you wish to learn. You can't do this on your own, because you don't know what you don't know. 
Meanwhile the USG is built on principles exactly contrary to that. The USG is all about inclusion, and all against discrimination. The USG is all about `making voices heard`, which stands exactly opposite to `making the idiots shut up`. It's all about `acceptance` and Gini indexes, which stand exactly opposite to the workings of competence and ability. The USG is all about equality, and not grading kids, and giving everyone a trophy, and preventing `bullying`, which is its codeword for hierarchy formation. All this directly means that anyone who's any good at anything whatsoever grew up in a different space. Whether it's a geographically or intellectually isolated pocket within the physical space the USG tells itself it occupies or not, fact remains, any expert alive grew up outside of the USG. 
Which makes the USG his enemy. Whether he has yet had that `moment of awareness` the soviet survivors talk of or not, whether he realises it or not, whether he's fighting the realisation or not, whatever his own contorted interior life may look like, nevertheless, the USG is all about destroying the very possibility of the world that he was born in. That's the very definition of the enemy. And now, ask yourself : how much does your enemy have to pay you to convince you to work for him ?
It can be done, right ? It's not that hard, really. Ah, but how much does your enemy have to pay you to be able to rely on you in his hour of need ? That one time when you can just drive a length of steel through his heart and walk away, how much ? How much would it have to pay you today so that when judgement finally comes, and it is sent to hell for being outright evil, how much would you take to go down with it then, for fellowship ? How much does your enemy have to pay you for you to love him ?
Different questions altogether. Evil can never be loved, and for this reason patriotism is such a sore word in the modern festering pustule occupying what was once the civilised world. Consequently, most people with any self awareness and self respect wouldn't work for the USG any more than they'd want two cocks probing their rectum, and when they do work for it they feel thus used. The minority without either self awareness or self respect isn't going to be very competent by the very implication of what these things mean : one can't ever get all that good at anything absent self awareness or self respect. 
So there you have it : the USG can never afford to pay enough, and for this reason it is not long for this world. Or vice-versa. All it can afford are the social sciences postdocs, ie, the people with no self respect, and a bunch of mindless drones without any clear understanding of anything in particular, ie, the people with no self awareness. 
That's all it can afford and that's all you're going to see. Don't hold your breath for the great American novel, Minitruth has Jezbel and that twerp with the global warming and it'll have to be good enough.">iii</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>asciilifeform</strong> Can't afford - or won't prioritize ?<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Can.Not.Afford.</p>
<p>*	asciilifeform favours crackpot theory: the seekrit skvirels prefer to enlist 'pure blood Aryans' and this is a painful constraint for them.<sup><a href="#footnote_3_56091" id="identifier_3_56091" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="In general, when one sucks at any given task, and that one also has an overdeveloped narcisiac side eager to prevent any ego wounds, that one will claim nobility.
How does claiming nobility go ? Well, suppose Mary sucks at parking, so after five painful minutes watching her fail to pull the car in, you kick her out and park the damned car. At which point do you know what Mary has to say ? 
`Well of course I could have done it using the steering wheel. Anyone can do it with the steering wheel.`
Right ? She was being noble, trying to use a car without touching plebeian later additions such as the steering wheel. This is Claiming Nobility : the pretense that one was trying to satisfy a set of requirements distinct from the actual requirements of the task at hand, and constructed after the completion of the task out of the errors of the speaker that failed to complete it. Generally (due to meta-cognitive issues that beset the unskilled) that hastily arrayed lot will be a) inconsistent, b) not a very good description of the errors made so that one could have still performed better than the speaker even admitting the nonsensical set of riders and c) not exhaustive, leaving various bits and pieces of practice unexplained (`So then why were both your hands on it at all times, even when you should have touched the clutch ?`). 
This is what I'm seeing here. The US `secret squirrels` are leaking information at a shocking rate - the French never got owned this badly and yet nobody would share intelligence with them after WW2 because `they can't keep a lid on anything`. This complete and utter failure can only be explained by a complete collapse of the system, because not being able to acquire anything valuable is one thing, which may be related to the enemy's hardness rather than your own incompetence, however an inability to keep your own, arbitrarily generated secret documents secret is disqualifying. Think of a second generation rich kid that never manages to extend the family fortune his father made, but keeps it safe. Think then of his son, third generation rich kid, that never manages to hold on to any part of the family fortune his grandfather made and his father kept. We are here.">iv</a></sup><br />
<strong>BingoBoingo</strong> Lol.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> That's provably false : if they did, you'd know what the definition of Aryan is.<sup><a href="#footnote_4_56091" id="identifier_4_56091" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Quite. You see, the larger something is, the more observable it becomes. This rule can not ever be broken, and this is why apparent failure for no apparent cause can not ever be explained by `a cause so large`. 
To best illustrate this problem, consider you're watching a work of fiction, say a crime mystery. Someone's killing butlers all over the place, horrifically beheaded and with the head missing. Imagine now that an hour into this thing, it was explained that nobody is really killing the butlers, they're all dropping dead because they said the word `it` and if anyone says the word it the knights of Ni pop out of nowhere and take his head.
Wouldn't you expect to have noticed this earlier, like for instance at minute 1:12, when the narrator said `it` and there was no blood gurgle audible ? If in fact there existed such a rule of the universe, you wouldn't find out about it examining the minutia of butler disappearances in well to do mansions, but quite a tad sooner I daresay.">v</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>asciilifeform</strong> Definition of Aryan << something like Herr Snowden.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> "Something like" is not much of a definition.</p>
<p><strong>asciilifeform</strong> American military tradition borrows heavily from the Brits.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Orly. How did they manage to enlist a tranny then ?<sup><a href="#footnote_5_56091" id="identifier_5_56091" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Remember private Charlotte Manning or whatever it was ? The guy with the redditesque `doubts` about things and everything ?">vi</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>asciilifeform</strong> Slightly different dynamic there. Any street scum can enlist as a private. I think they even removed the age limits recently.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> But... they gave him the keys.<sup><a href="#footnote_6_56091" id="identifier_6_56091" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="No argument, anyone can make cannon fodder. But this guy was no cannon fodder, now was he ? He wasn't in the front line, naked but for the rifle, skirmishing with the enemy. He was in fact at a safe location, some place other people were tasked with dying to protect.
Getting back to the earlier point : how would you feel if you were an absolute expert, minutiously perfect, hired to do a job by the USG, which position you somehow accepted, contrary to the earlier discussion. Say because you're young and that makes you an idiot. But at your workplace, there's another guy, doing nominally the same job, on the same pay grade, who got there because he's black and the USG must has token black people in the white house. He's not doing anything useful outside of being you know, a complete moron, and in this making the USG's communist dedication apparent to potential critics/comissars. Would you tend to stick to your minutious perfection on the long term, or rather just go boozing with the morons ? 
Self respect shot by self awareness, huh. Well, so there you go, that's why it can't happen. It just doesn't work that way. 
How many minor infractions do you suppose were created in private Manning's workplace by the fact that he had `doubts about his sexuality` which failed to result in immediate canning and complete social mortification meanwhile ? It's obviously not the place of the guard to go, `I'm sitting here guarding with my life a bunch of trannies boozing in there` and get all depressed - he's merely a guard, and for all he knows that's how you crack codes : wearing a skirt and pouring Martini after Martini in the enema bag. However, it would be your place to observe that look at that poor guard, sitting there ready to die to defend - what ?! This fucktard ? 
Oh, I see, such wouldn't have been nice. Great. Go be nice all over some `research` you made explaining all about how being nice trumps being good, and how you don't really need discriminating minds and steeled hearts to be good at anything practically useful. Preferably make that research based on a song you wrote based on some lyrics you wrote, and for bonus points include `Black and white are the same color` and `I've never been punched` somewhere in there. I'm sure Mommy will applaud and what difference does it make that this psychotic dynamic is what made Daddy leave ? Love is all you need, eh.">vii</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>asciilifeform</strong> They gave him the keys << the Anglos have a historic problem, in that they never invented политрукs. Thus they have issues with quis custodiet ipsos custodes. 'Diplomatic' (intelligence) corps are still largely 'Aryan' afaik.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> You're trying to sell this conceptual model where in alt-Nazi Germany one can be hung for being a Jew ONLY IF working as a clerk, but otherwise, all gravy. By its very nature aryan-ism has to be universal. Too painful cognitive dissonance otherwise.</p>
<p>*	asciilifeform returns, every time he thinks about any of this, to the Great Mystery of why our beloved phriends never, ever leak anything interestingly cryptological<br />
*	asciilifeform wants to know wtf is in '<a href=http://www.loper-os.org/?p=1323>suite A</a>', how AES drips key bits, etc.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Stan's wishlist :D</p>
<p><strong>asciilifeform</strong> If wishes were atomic dirigibles, beggars would rain thermonuclear hell upon their enemies. But in all seriousness, a leak history that favours tedious operational garbage and entirely omits the good stuff suggests 'hangout'.<br />
*	asciilifeform regards hypothesis 'there is no good stuff' as unproven<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> The stuff that was leaked so far mostly follows the "brain percentage" criterion.<sup><a href="#footnote_7_56091" id="identifier_7_56091" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="There's a major point we conveniently won't go into : most leaks so far have been predicated on a desire to prove the value of a stash. If I have the complete collection of your daughter's emails, and intend to prove this to you, I will not show you her naked selfies, for two main reasons. One, that you are probably ill equipped to judge if they are authentic or not, and the other because sharing them actually lowers the value of my trove. Instead, I will go for exactly boring operational details, showing you that I know that she went with you on a dad-daughter trip and the train was late exactly 8 minutes should be enough for my needs.
The fact that the naked selfies do exist and are in fact leaked can be judged publicly through all sorts of indirect means. Perhaps the best example today would be the HeartBleed headshot.">viii</a></sup> The stuff you want to know about, three people know. Unless one of them is the source, it's not leaking.</p>
<p><strong>asciilifeform</strong> Not necessarily. The inventor, of, say, 'joseki' is probably long dead - but a small army of monkeys (engineers, sw/hw production staff, auditors, etc) have access to 'the goods' - and they aren't leaking either.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Small. It's purely statistical, like say a biopsy. You'll find much less pituitary cells in a random biopsy than muscle tissue.</p>
<p><strong>asciilifeform</strong> At the risk of sounding like Anatoliy Golitsyn (infamous fellow who insists, even today, that USSR faked its own death) - the available, afaik, evidence suggests either terrible - or incredibly good - cryptology.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Let me put it some other way. Wouldn't you expect that if MP is conversant in PGP, so would be Obama ? So that people couldn't like, you knoiw, steal his selfies from his plaintext gmail acct ?</p>
<p><strong>asciilifeform</strong> Obama - no. Private cocksucker - also no. Shadowfuhrer? Sure.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Oh shadowfuhrer is it. That's a contradiction in terms don't you know.<sup><a href="#footnote_8_56091" id="identifier_8_56091" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="For the exact same reason Aryanism has to be universal, let's work these together.
The whole concept of a Fuhrer as practiced by the Nazis is all about public image. As the actual shadow points out in a recently reviewed film, `You don't hold elected office in this town. You run it because people think you do. They stop thinking it you stop running it.`
The point of the Fuhrer isn't that he's any good - which emphatically he was not, neither the original corporal nor the ulterior bank robber (you know him as Stalin) or shoemaker (you know him as Ceausescu) or whatever other later clone. All these people trying to reenact the Augustan model of governance weren't personally very inept, of course, but they were not in their position because of anything to do with their ability. It wasn't a position merited in any conventional sense of that term.
Instead, they were in the position because their face was on the coin, so to speak, or more plainly, because any system large enough and complex enough needs its own MP, which is to say one in whose hands the buck always stops, guaranteedly. Just how competent or incompetent or tall or sexy this person is matters not, what matters is that he predictably satisfies a need of the system, which is to not have any circular graphs : his inclusion in any graph means the graph is not a cycle and this allows the system to continue chugging along without getting lost into infinity.
This said, obviously a `shadowfuhrer` is exactly like dry water - a thing that could never be. Even admitting water somehow `were` dry, it still wouldn't be water in any sense, because the reason you even drink water in the first place is that it's wet, and its wetness is specifically and as such required by a gazillion little processes going on constantly inside your body. 
Aryanism as a concept is no different, because it works very similarly to the Augustan model : it's a direct, simple, DIY means of social hierarchy. In most societies it matters not what the hierarchy actually is just as long as it exists, or to quote #7 in #bitcoin-assets +m,
The #bitcoin-assets aristocracy is not incompetent. Whether in anyone’s estimation others not named are just as or even more competent is immaterial : arbitrariety is not the problem, incompetence is. The #bitcoin-assets aristocracy is not particularly fixed, at least in the sense of it being extensible (in fact the list was 25 names long earlier). Therefore, objections on this line will have to be a lot more refined than simply “it’s undemocratic and therefore bad” or “it’s unrepresentative and therefore evil”. Reality doesn’t work that way.
So, are you whiter than him or darker than him ? If whiter, you go before him, if darker after him. Problem of `who goes first` solved, and inasmuch as it's an irrelevant problem anyway, it doesn't matter how it's solved just as long as it's solved. The Arabs implement this exact solution, which is why I never saw buluceala in their very popular mosques. The Romanians do not implement it, or anything else, and as such buluceala is their way of life and they wonder why nothing can ever get done because all available time and any available resources get wasted in an effort to sort a group. (The Italians are the exact same way, by the way, and from what I hear the Greeks idem.)
It should be obvious now why partial Aryanism defeats the entire purpose : if there's cases and modes, you'll get the same  buluceala of people, with the only difference that they're arguing your cases and modes rather than whatever (exactly identical) nonsense they'd have argued otherwise. So might as well not have it then, not like it makes a difference, and so if it doesn't make a difference it can't pay for its lease on the domain name, so to speak. In other words, nobody would remember its name or call it by the name if it doesn't do anything. This is why you have a name to distinguish a knife from a fork, but all rocks are equally rocks to you. Unless, of course, they're boulders.">ix</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>asciilifeform</strong> Ahaha.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> For srs.</p>
<p><strong>asciilifeform</strong> Nothing mystical about thinking like a proper armchair general and pondering the strength of the hidden column of enemy. When the apparent column is so suggestive of 'ablative' cannon fodder tactic.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> The notion that there exists an unseen reality behind the seen reality, whether right or wrong, is the very substance of mysticism. </p>
<p><strong>asciilifeform</strong> For proper mysticism, the hidden side must be deemed 'unknowable'. Here it is merely unknown. It will make itself known, presumably, if it advances to the front line and 'fires' - but wouldn't it be great to know -before- ?<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> No, that's hermetism, when it can't be known. Mysticism is an erryday activity. It somewhat shares the fate of "frustration" in the hands of popidiocy, but outside of what the reddit horde thinks, frustration is a major psychological process, the fundament of all volitive activity.<sup><a href="#footnote_11_56091" id="identifier_11_56091" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="And similarly, the implication goes, is mysticism a fundamental part of thinking. I am aware it got a bad name, but for that matter what hasn't ? Anything difficult, anything disrespectful of the mediocre man, anything disinterested in his aspirations and expectations gets a bad name. Money got a bad name, for christ's sake. Whores got a bad name. Anything worth doing, anything right and proper in this world got a bad name, what the hell would come to pass if we started taking `bad names` to heart ? 
Any sixteen year old knows that `a bad name` simply means worthwhile, interesting and potentially fascinating. Any sixteen year old that's not going to end up a mediocre accountant as the pinnacle of his achievement, at any rate.">xii</a></sup></p>

They really have nothing to do with each other, and on a more general note : it is always a good idea to note the type of words and make sure you don't mix them unduly. For instance, explanations of ontological issues in phenomenological terms are always defective, and so can be the attempt to explain phenomena in terms of οὔσῶν, especially if executed by pedestrians.
(To save you some quiet contemplative work with the books, catstyle : ὄντος (aka ontos) is the masculine genitive singular	present participle of εἰμί (eimi), whereas οὔσης (ousia) is the feminine. This entire discussion has nothing to do with its rich tradition however, we're merely using οὔσῶν, ouson, as the plural masculine, in the tradition of using the plural masculine to denote the kind. So, `things of the kind of things that make ontology`. Isn't flexion a thing of splendor ?) ">xiii</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>jurov</strong> Is there a historical example of such a mastermind?<br />
<strong>asciilifeform</strong> Perhaps I implied that a literal 'lizard king' lives. This is not a necessary hypothesis for a cryptologically-strong USA, 'lizard king' perhaps should be understood as 'set of remaining competent commanders', i.e. http://btcbase.org/log/?date=27-07-2014#772890<br />

<p><strong>asciilifeform</strong> The hypothetical master doesn't need to. He just sorta sits there quietly and bakes pills against RSA; creates diddled but internationally-appealing block ciphers; etc.<br />
<strong>jurov</strong> But you imply he needs to pull strings in addition to that.</p>
<p><strong>asciilifeform</strong> He sits and plays 'Tetris' on his handmade optical CPU.<br />
<strong>jurov</strong> So now we know what stan's fapping to. Handmade optical CPUs.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> A brain devoid of spinal chord can not work. Your "mastermind", provided he exists, is drunk and insane.</p>
<p><strong>asciilifeform</strong> The strings, in this hypothetical narrative, are pulled by another master - one of disinfo, whose purpose would then consist of shielding the former greybeard. This is, admittedly, merely a plausible - if fantastic - hypothesis. But one admitted by the known facts. Like the nonphysical solution to a quadratic.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> It's not plausible. It is entertaining, but it lacks a fundamental point for plausibility : it's unbalanced.</p>
<p><strong>asciilifeform</strong> Unbalanced ? How's that ?<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Well let's see. Suppose you have a <a href=https://btc.waroflife.com/>WoL</a> game table. While in principle any configuration is as possible as any other, the configuration you propose is mod2, ie, if the cell index is odd, cell is dead, if not, alive. This is not actually a possible outcome.</p>
<p>Aug 17 00:28:26 <strong>asciilifeform</strong> This is known as a 'garden of eden state' (in cellular automata jargon).<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> It's what I mean by unbalanced. If you take "meaning" as a rough equivalent for enthalpy, your thing is too meaningful to exist.</p>
<p><strong>asciilifeform</strong> But how does this apply? My hypothetical is a historically-humdrum 'skunk works' scenario.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> No, it's not. Your hypotethical is a brain in a jar separated from a pile of muscle in a barrel. Which both, independently, work, for the greater glory of theoretical abstraction. This is directly contradictory to how the world works, and specifically because your abstract objects tend to be contextless, which requires too large an expenditure of "meaning" for them to exist,<sup><a href="#footnote_14_56091" id="identifier_14_56091" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Admittedly all this is beyond vague. Let's see if we can work it together.
Suppose you're God. Seeing how you just found this out, you count as a noob. Seeing how you're smart enough to be on Trilema, you're probably also not the sort of retard that starts immediately building a whole universe on his 2nd minute as a God. So you take it slow, decide to build a romance novel first. 
Can you ask your readers to believe your male hero is a socially marginal, insecure klutz ? Yes, you can. Easily. It'll not cost you anything, in fact, the readers will pay you to ask them to believe that. So this much is +EV and you even have a little capital to work with, which explains why you never read male-pov romance novels where the male is supercool (well, except for Trilema, but anyway).
Can you ask your readers to believe your female hero is a (and I quote), `buxom blonde with flowing hair` ? Yes, actually, but it will cost you. Not that many human females are blonde, most are brunettes. Admittedly you're not asking for redheaded miracles here, but still. Buxom, for any definition of the term, is also quite rare, and there you go, you've wasted your little capital and are headed straight into the red. 
Now, on strict statistical terms, there's hundreds of millions of blonde chicks out there, and out of them millions have double D tits or heavier. So what's the big deal, right, this is merely the story of one among millions! Well... the trouble is that you've run out of capital, suspension of disbelief is work, and work is capital, so there you go. Fair or unfair, capitalism is capitalism.
So now : can there exist an unicellular organism that moves about in its environment ? Turns out that yes, there can, and moreover there does. But can there exist an unicellular organism that lives in a cave, outside of any contact with the Sun at all ? (This is trickier than it seems, because all Earth energy cycling is backed by the solar FED, and without it you may not live long) Turns out that yes, there can, and there do! But can there exist multicellular organisms that live in such a sealed cave ? Yes, there can, and yes, they do. But... can there exist mammals ? Yes, actually, there can exist mammals. Except... they don't actually exist. Zing!
The reason for this is that `the Earth` (understood as all the planets with life on them in the Universe) is not currently large enough to allow for the certain theoretical possibility of a cave large enough and old enough to have given rise to cave mammals. So : it's not sufficient for a posited alt-thing to not break the strict laws of nature that show `such a thing could never exist`. It's also necessary to navigate the proportional laws of nature, that show `such a thing would require Y to exist`. If your thing can exist according to the first pass, but could only actually exist if fifteen billion years were spent in evolution to reach that point, zing! The universe's not yet old enough, come back in a billion years or two. How do you like that ?
And now we are equipped to understand the `meaning` comment : you see, all living things are meaningful in the sense any prototype is meaningful : if you give it to an engineer that engineer could tell you things about it. These things are not random strings, because if you give the same thing to a different engineer, he may tell you different things, but not different enough to feed a cryptographical application off their output. If the prototype you need is too meaningful it may readily be too meaningful to exist. Make sense now ?">xv</a></sup> which makes jurov's fap observation quite on point : you're not describing a real, live human female here, you're describing a mythological beast abstracted out of miles of pr0nz reel.<sup><a href="#footnote_15_56091" id="identifier_15_56091" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Sure the super-heroine that cooks very well, enjoys her bukkake work and is a F1 pilot by day could exist, just like the sharpshooter specialist in classical Greek literature with a side of stockbrokering could exist.

Chitlin MP : `Just an antenna.`
Dad of MP : `Sure. You need a jamming device.`
You see, making a jamming device for a specified antenna is one thing. Making a jamming device for any antenna is a scary project that as as far as I know has never been seriously undertaken. Now try and do it without any buttons, which is to say, make not an adjustable jammer, but a universal jammer. One that doesn't use an infinity of power, of course, and that's sustainable over time, of course. Note that we don't specifically know this to be impossible, either.

<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Well counterfactuals are problematic, but let's see if you can get painted into a corner.</p>
<p><strong>asciilifeform</strong> Please do.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Does this SU exist ? (Something useful.)</p>
<p><strong>asciilifeform</strong> That's the hypothesis. What if yes ?<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> We are already accepting your hypothesis, I'm asking you questions as if your hypothesis was reality.<sup><a href="#footnote_17_56091" id="identifier_17_56091" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="A little game of oracle.

<p><strong>asciilifeform</strong> I'd say it has not been used. Waiting to the pig to get fatter, before slaughter.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> So it's never been used. Is it physically located ?<sup><a href="#footnote_18_56091" id="identifier_18_56091" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="First, we establish if it's part of history.

As it isn't, we proceed on the triad, first by examining if it's part of ontology, then by examining if it's part of gnoseology. Because, you see, a thing that's not physically located and that isn't known about therefore exists as part of metaphysics. 
And mind that these questions are harder than they seem, because they don't allow much escape. For instance, say something exists somewhere nobody's ever been. Well... how come ? Why is that ? How did it get to be there ? Why does it stay there, and what happens the day someone stumbles upon this enchanted Amazonia where women actually somehow are fit to rule and yet don't wear bras ?

<p><strong>asciilifeform</strong> Help me along then, what's the experiment here?<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Well, either the SU keepers are in (absolute) power, or else they are not. If they are not, the number of problems that appear is overwhelming. If they are, then they have had to have kept it historically.

<p><strong>asciilifeform</strong> Why this dichotomy. Is it not possible for them to have absolute power to guard 'the goods' but not, say, to control other aspects of the world ? Like any ordinary guard.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> No. Power does not divide. This is why the government needs both the power to kill people and the power to inflate the currency, and this is why wrestling any away is enough to kill the thing.</p>
<p><strong>asciilifeform</strong> So, continuing with this lemma, the 'guard' is an impossibility because, were he to exist, he could trivially order his supposed superiors to disappear forever up their own arses, should he wish this?<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Basically. Now, in usual high fiction this is resolved as a bizarre order of sworn monks and so on. But mind ye that all through the middle ages about half the bastards were sons of monks.<sup><a href="#footnote_27_56091" id="identifier_27_56091" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="It's all an application of natura non facit saltus, which is why you can't have an infinitely large rock housed in an infinitely tiny box, nor can you have a ten ton bridge propped by a toothpick, nor a number of similar things.

<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Sure, but then <mircea_popescu> does everybody know about it ?</p>
<p><strong>asciilifeform</strong> I wouldn't imagine the 'sworn monks' can keep the lid on indefinitely - only thus far. As we've seen, they succeed in keeping the lid on 'suite a' &#038; co.

<p>So no, the current USG can never pay the people that are any good enough. Ever. No matter how much it borrows and spends, never could it have enough. The reason is quite exactly <em>the same</em> as the reason your wife will never take two dicks to the asshole or tan her skin <em>that other way</em> at the beach. That reason is that these are fundamentally different worlds, and each whole, complete worlds at that. (The misguided notion that "anyone could be a whore" is addressed <a href=http://trilema.com/2011/oricine-poate-sa/>here</a>, by the way.) It takes a lot of training, and a lot of <em>talent</em> and actual interest on the part of the subject to become that good a slut. All this takes time. Time that your wife didn't spend this way. She didn't run off with the circus when she was 13 to show everyone her only pubic hair at the time. She didn't spend every waking hour behind the cameras on porn sets when she was a well used 16 yo tramp, watching enraptured every drop of the action. It's just not her thing, she didn't put the time into it, she's not into it, she'll never be any good at it. Maybe she'll be good at other things, but generally speaking, you don't ask the doctor why he isn't a great lawyer and similarly you don't ask your wife why she isn't a great whore.</p>
<p>This is how it goes for all people that are good at things : becoming good at anything whatsoever is all about discrimination : this is right, that is wrong. Jimmy is doing it correctly, Johnny is doing it wrongly. Mary is a smart cookie, Imani is a fucktard. To become good at anything whatsoever you absolutely require a hierarchy, based on oppression of Imanis and Johnnys, and on discrimination against their actions, beliefs and opinions. A hierarchy to indicate who are the masters, and the experts, from whom you wish to learn. You can't do this on your own, because <a href=http://trilema.com/2014/patriarchy-is-a-thing-because-nobody-likes-living-in-a-world-populated-by-little-girls/>you don't know what you don't know</a>. </p>
<p>Meanwhile the USG is built on principles exactly contrary to that. The USG is all about inclusion, and all against discrimination. The USG is all about "making voices heard", which stands exactly opposite to "making the idiots shut up". It's all about "acceptance" and Gini indexes, which stand exactly opposite to the workings of competence and ability. The USG is all about equality, and not grading kids, and giving everyone a trophy, and preventing "bullying", which is its codeword for hierarchy formation. All this directly means that anyone who's any good at anything whatsoever grew up in a different space. Whether it's a geographically or intellectually isolated pocket within the physical space the USG tells itself it occupies or not, fact remains, any expert alive grew up outside of the USG. </p>
<p>Which makes the USG his enemy. Whether he has yet had that "moment of awareness" the soviet survivors talk of or not, whether he realises it or not, whether he's fighting the realisation or not, whatever his own contorted interior life may look like, nevertheless, the USG is all about destroying the very possibility of the world that he was born in. That's the very definition of the enemy. And now, ask yourself : how much does your enemy have to pay you to convince you to work for him ?</p>
<p>It can be done, right ? It's not that hard, really. Ah, but how much does your enemy have to pay you <em>to be able to rely on you in his hour of need</em> ? That one time when you can just drive a length of steel through his heart and walk away, how much ? How much would it have to pay you today so that when judgement finally comes, and it is sent to hell for being outright evil, how much would you take to go down with it then, for fellowship ? How much does your enemy have to pay you for you <em>to love him</em> ?</p>
<p>Different questions altogether. Evil can never be loved, and for this reason patriotism is such a sore word in the modern festering pustule occupying what was once the civilised world. Consequently, most people with any self awareness and self respect wouldn't work for the USG any more than they'd want two cocks probing their rectum, and when they do work for it they feel thus used. The minority without either self awareness or self respect isn't going to be very competent by the very implication of what these things mean : one can't ever get all that good at anything absent self awareness or self respect. </p>
<p>So there you have it : the USG can never afford to pay enough, and for this reason it is not long for this world. Or vice-versa. All it can afford are the social sciences postdocs, ie, the people with no self respect, and a bunch of mindless drones without any clear understanding of anything in particular, ie, the people with no self awareness. </p>

<p>How does claiming nobility go ? Well, suppose Mary sucks at parking, so after five painful minutes watching her fail to pull the car in, you kick her out and park the damned car. At which point do you know what Mary has to say ? </p>
<p>"Well of course I could have done it using the steering wheel. Anyone can do it with the steering wheel."</p>
<p>Right ? She was being noble, trying to use a car without touching plebeian later additions such as the steering wheel. This is Claiming Nobility : the pretense that one was trying to satisfy a set of requirements distinct from the actual requirements of the task at hand, and constructed after the completion of the task out of the errors of the speaker that failed to complete it. Generally (due to meta-cognitive issues that beset the unskilled) that hastily arrayed lot will be a) inconsistent, b) not a very good description of the errors made so that one could have still performed better than the speaker even admitting the nonsensical set of riders and c) not exhaustive, leaving various bits and pieces of practice unexplained ("So then why were both your hands on it at all times, even when you should have touched the clutch ?"). </p>
<p>This is what I'm seeing here. The US "secret squirrels" are leaking information at a shocking rate - the French never got owned this badly and yet nobody would share intelligence with them after WW2 because "they can't keep a lid on anything". This complete and utter failure can only be explained by a complete collapse of the system, because not being able to acquire anything valuable is one thing, which may be related to the enemy's hardness rather than your own incompetence, however an inability to keep your own, arbitrarily generated secret documents secret is disqualifying. Think of a second generation rich kid that never manages to extend the family fortune his father made, but keeps it safe. Think then of his son, third generation rich kid, that never manages to hold on to any part of the family fortune his grandfather made and his father kept. We are here.

You see, the larger something is, the more observable it becomes. This rule can not ever be broken, and this is why apparent failure for no apparent cause can not ever be explained by "a cause so large". </p>
<p>To best illustrate this problem, consider you're watching a work of fiction, say a crime mystery. Someone's killing butlers all over the place, horrifically beheaded and with the head missing. Imagine now that an hour into this thing, it was explained that nobody is really killing the butlers, they're all dropping dead because they said the word "it" and if anyone says the word it the knights of Ni pop out of nowhere and take his head.</p>
<p>Wouldn't you expect to have noticed this earlier, like for instance at minute 1:12, when the narrator said "it" and there was no blood gurgle audible ? If in fact there existed such a rule of the universe, you wouldn't find out about it examining the minutia of butler disappearances in well to do mansions, but quite a tad sooner I daresay.

<p>Getting back to the earlier point : how would you feel if you were an absolute expert, minutiously perfect, hired to do a job by the USG, which position you somehow accepted, contrary to the earlier discussion. Say because you're young and that makes you an idiot. But at your workplace, there's another guy, doing nominally the same job, on the same pay grade, who got there because he's black and the USG must has token black people in the white house. He's not doing anything useful outside of being you know, a complete moron, and in this making the USG's communist dedication apparent to potential critics/comissars. Would you tend to stick to your minutious perfection on the long term, or rather just go boozing with the morons ? </p>
<p>Self respect shot by self awareness, huh. Well, so there you go, that's why it can't happen. It just doesn't work that way. </p>
<p>How many minor infractions do you suppose were created in private Manning's workplace by the fact that he had "doubts about his sexuality" which failed to result in immediate canning and complete social mortification meanwhile ? It's obviously not the place of the guard to go, "I'm sitting here guarding with my life a bunch of trannies boozing in there" and get all depressed - he's merely a guard, and for all he knows that's how you crack codes : wearing a skirt and pouring Martini after Martini in the enema bag. However, it <em>would</em> be your place to observe that look at that poor guard, sitting there ready to die to defend - what ?! This fucktard ? </p>
<p>Oh, I see, such wouldn't have been nice. Great. Go be nice all over some "research" you made explaining all about how being nice trumps being good, and how you don't really need discriminating minds and steeled hearts to be good at anything practically useful. Preferably make that research based on a song you wrote based on some lyrics you wrote, and for bonus points include "Black and white are the same color" and "I've never been punched" somewhere in there. I'm sure Mommy will applaud and what difference does it make that this psychotic dynamic is what made Daddy leave ? Love is all you need, eh.

One, that you are probably ill equipped to judge if they are authentic or not, and the other because sharing them actually lowers the value of my trove.

<p>The whole concept of a Fuhrer as practiced by the Nazis is all about public image. As the actual shadow points out in a <a href=http://trilema.com/2014/millers-crossing/>recently reviewed film</a>, "You don't hold elected office in this town. You run it because people think you do. They stop thinking it you stop running it."</p>
<p>The point of the Fuhrer isn't that he's any good - which emphatically he was not, neither the original corporal nor the ulterior bank robber (you know him as Stalin) or shoemaker (you know him as Ceausescu) or whatever other later clone. All these people trying to reenact the Augustan model of governance weren't personally very inept, of course, but they were not in their position because of anything to do with their ability. It wasn't a position <em>merited</em> in any conventional sense of that term.</p>
<p>Instead, they were in the position because their face was on the coin, so to speak, or more plainly, because any system large enough and complex enough needs its own MP, which is to say one in whose hands the buck always stops, guaranteedly. Just how competent or incompetent or tall or sexy this person is matters not, what matters is that he predictably satisfies a need <em>of the system</em>, which is to not have any circular graphs : his inclusion in any graph means the graph is not a cycle and this allows the system to continue chugging along without getting lost into infinity.</p>
<p>This said, obviously a "shadowfuhrer" is exactly like dry water - a thing that could never be. Even admitting water somehow "were" dry, it still wouldn't be water in any sense, because the reason you even drink water in the first place is that it's wet, and its wetness is specifically and as such required by a gazillion little processes going on constantly inside your body. </p>
<p>Aryanism as a concept is no different, because it works very similarly to the Augustan model : it's a direct, simple, DIY means of social hierarchy. In most societies it matters not what the hierarchy <em>actually is</em> just as long as it exists, or to quote #7 in <a href=http://trilema.com/2014/bitcoin-assets-m/>#bitcoin-assets +m</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>The #bitcoin-assets aristocracy is not incompetent. Whether in anyone’s estimation others not named are just as or even more competent is immaterial : arbitrariety is not the problem, incompetence is. The #bitcoin-assets aristocracy is not particularly fixed, at least in the sense of it being extensible (in fact the list was 25 names long earlier). Therefore, objections on this line will have to be a lot more refined than simply “it’s undemocratic and therefore bad” or “it’s unrepresentative and therefore evil”. Reality doesn’t work that way.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, are you whiter than him or darker than him ? If whiter, you go before him, if darker after him. Problem of "who goes first" solved, and inasmuch as it's an irrelevant problem anyway, it doesn't matter <em>how</em> it's solved just as long as it's solved. The Arabs implement this exact solution, which is why I never saw <em>buluceala</em> in their very popular mosques. The Romanians do not implement it, or anything else, and as such <em>buluceala</em> is their way of life and they wonder why nothing can ever get done because all available time and any available resources get wasted in an effort to sort a group. (The Italians are the exact same way, by the way, and from what I hear the Greeks idem.)</p>
<p>It should be obvious now why partial Aryanism defeats the entire purpose : if there's cases and modes, you'll get the same  <em>buluceala</em> of people, with the only difference that they're arguing your cases and modes rather than whatever (exactly identical) nonsense they'd have argued otherwise. So might as well not have it then, not like it makes a difference, and so if it doesn't make a difference it can't pay for its lease on the domain name, so to speak. In other words, nobody would remember its name or call it by the name if it doesn't do anything. This is why you have a name to distinguish a knife from a fork, but all rocks are equally rocks to you. Unless, of course, they're boulders.

Let's see if we can work it together.</p>
<p>Suppose you're God. Seeing how you just found this out, you count as a noob. Seeing how you're smart enough to be on Trilema, you're probably also not the sort of retard that starts immediately building a whole universe on his 2nd minute as a God. So you take it slow, decide to build a romance novel first. </p>
<p>Can you ask your readers to believe your male hero is a socially marginal, insecure klutz ? Yes, you can. Easily. It'll not cost you anything, in fact, the readers will <em>pay you</em> to ask them to believe that. So this much is +EV and you even have a little capital to work with, which explains why you never read male-pov romance novels where the male is supercool (well, except for Trilema, but anyway).</p>
<p>Can you ask your readers to believe your female hero is a (and <a href=http://trilema.com/2011/ochiul-lui-argorn-de-jim-theis/>I quote</a>), "buxom blonde with flowing hair" ? Yes, actually, but it will cost you. Not that many human females are blonde, most are brunettes. Admittedly you're not asking for redheaded miracles here, but still. Buxom, for any definition of the term, is also quite rare, and there you go, you've wasted your little capital and are headed straight into the red. </p>
<p>Now, on strict statistical terms, there's hundreds of millions of blonde chicks out there, and out of them millions have double D tits or heavier. So what's the big deal, right, this is merely the story of one among millions! Well... the trouble is that you've run out of capital, suspension of disbelief is work, and work is capital, so there you go. Fair or unfair, capitalism is capitalism.</p>
<p>So now : can there exist an unicellular organism that moves about in its environment ? Turns out that yes, there can, and moreover there does. But can there exist an unicellular organism that lives in a cave, outside of any contact with the Sun <em>at all</em> ? (This is trickier than it seems, because all Earth energy cycling is backed by the solar FED, and without it you may not live long) Turns out that yes, there can, and there do! But can there exist multicellular organisms that live in such a sealed cave ? Yes, there can, and yes, they do. But... can there exist mammals ? Yes, actually, there can exist mammals. Except... they don't actually exist. Zing!</p>
<p>The reason for this is that "the Earth" (understood as all the planets with life on them in the Universe) is not currently large enough to allow for the certain theoretical possibility of a cave large enough and old enough to have given rise to cave mammals. So : it's not sufficient for a posited alt-thing to not break the strict laws of nature that show "such a thing could never exist". It's also necessary to navigate the proportional laws of nature, that show "such a thing would require Y to exist". If your thing can exist according to the first pass, but could only actually exist if fifteen billion years were spent in evolution to reach that point, zing! The universe's not yet old enough, come back in a billion years or two. How do you like that ?</p>
<p>And now we are equipped to understand the "meaning" comment : you see, all living things are meaningful in the sense any prototype is meaningful : if you give it to an engineer that engineer could tell you things about it. These things are not random strings, because if you give the same thing to a different engineer, he may tell you different things, but not different enough to feed a cryptographical application off their output. If the prototype you need is <em>too meaningful</em> it may readily be too meaningful to exist. Make sense now ?

Dad of MP : "What antenna ?"<br />

<p>You see, making a jamming device for a specified antenna is one thing. Making a jamming device for <em>any</em> antenna is a scary project that as as far as I know has never been seriously undertaken. Now try and do it <em>without any buttons</em>, which is to say, make not an <em>adjustable</em> jammer, but a <em>universal</em> jammer. One that doesn't use an infinity of power, of course, and that's sustainable over time, of course. Note that we don't specifically know this to be impossible, either. Nevertheless, contextlessness always increases costs.</p>

<p>Gravity's Rainbow and Against the Day are both about this. Much of Pynchon I suppose. His work satisfies the child in me obsessed with hidden things behind the clockwork.</p>

						<p>A minor nitpick: the proverbial 'water motor' violently breaks known physical law as presently understood; the hypothetical non-fissile initiator of fusion - does not. It is a mere engineering conundrum, like the 'space ladder.' The answer may turn out to be a negative in practice - but it cannot be immediately dismissed on elementary physical grounds like perpetuum mobile.</p>
<p>(You can trivially initiate fusion right in your kitchen: say, strike a brick of palladium deuteride with a hammer. But - no chain reaction. Fortunately for folks who have done this.)</p>
<p>Another minor nitpick: Dr. Evil's hypothetical competent servants could work from a sense of 'duty for the motherland' rather than paid employment in the usual sense. </p>
<p>Alternatively, they can be stereotypical 'von Braun' types - 'once the rockets go up, who cares where they come down; that's not my department, says Wernher von Braun.' Not like there are all that many places to work as a professional cryptologist these days. People - even what we think of as 'thinking people' - will carry out astounding feats of 'doublethink' gymnastics if it means that they can go on in work to their liking and remain fed.</p>

						<p>@<b>Stanislav Datskovskiy</b><br />
<blockquote>the proverbial ‘water motor’ violently breaks known physical law as presently understood; the hypothetical non-fissile initiator of fusion - does not</p></blockquote>
<p>This is absolutely true, and I agree cold fusion remains a perfectly respectable and valid area of research. Nevertheless, my analogy was made with a view to the social and political implications, rather than to the science involved.</p>
<p>Admitting the water engine existed, for the sake of argument, is not necessarily a larger step than admitting the cold fusion reactor existed : they both, inasfar as we know, don't exist. Things that don't exist don't exist equally and in the same way, the woman that's not here because she's with her parents this weekend is just as not here as the woman that's not here because she's never met you. While it's true that the former has perhaps a better chance at materialising at some future point than the latter does (and it won't be an easy argument, which explains the reluctance of women when it comes to spending the weekend with their parents alone), this nevertheless is not germane insofar as we're not discussing future points.</p>
<p>What's left is said social and political angle of it. Either of these technologies/magicks, should they exist in secret somewhere, would be "repressed" or kept secret in the same way and ostensibly for the same reasons. Keeping things that can be done undone and secret is particularly difficult, however, as any devout Christian family with strong views on masturbation and teenage children in the house is bound to sooner or later discover.</p>
<blockquote><p>(You can trivially initiate fusion right in your kitchen: say, strike a brick of palladium deuteride with a hammer. But - no chain reaction. Fortunately for folks who have done this.)</p></blockquote>
<p>You know now and for the next week at least most readers will think of you as that one guy sitting in his kitchen hitting magic bricks with hammers. Best prepare with some sort of emergency plan in case unrelated doom strikes your neighbourhood. </p>
<blockquote><p>Another minor nitpick: Dr. Evil’s hypothetical competent servants could work from a sense of ‘duty for the motherland’ rather than paid employment in the usual sense.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, and this is addressed in the footnote. To quote a relevant part,</p>
<blockquote><p>How much does your enemy have to pay you for you to love him ?</p></blockquote>
<p>The original mechanism discussed payment. I imagine we both agree that angle may be laid to rest, as it fails. Now, it is perhaps possible that yes, the agents of Dr. Evil love him unrelatedly to being paid. But the question remains, how ? </p>
<p>Was it the case that they used to share a beautiful love story, and meanwhile Dr. Evil has turned rotten but their affections haven't caught up with it ? I have at least a couple of friends undergoing this exact process, where they did in fact, many decades ago, share exactly that love story with the present day Dr. Evil, back when he was a spar strangled banner strappy young fellow. They're both over sixty years old. Are you telling me this thing is supposed to survive as a going concern on the dissipating affections of people old enough to retire ? The word "retire" has a meaning you know.</p>
<p>Or perhaps is it the case that they share something secret and beautiful, like persay Dr. Evil fucks them in the ass just right and they'll never betray that bond for the pure knowledge that no replacement assfucker will ever be found ? This is a tenuous proposition, the bond exists and the mechanism does work (which I suspect is the premiere reason for the historical repression of homosexuality - straight men's perception that in a male-only society this sort of thing creates undue advantages for the participants, which they won't be able to breach, think something like "old boy's club with benefits") but nevertheless it has to be personal. Unless you're ready to argue that somewhere in the basements of Washington DC an actual Manson lives and breathes, and the million or so muppets constituting the present Evil Reich actually visit, physically, and actually share intimate delights with him, I will have a lot of trouble buying this. </p>
<p>Yes, ideology may to some degree work as a substitute in this vein. For one thing, it's not as easy as it looks to create an ideology that both a) satisfies whatever external actionables you may wish to include and b) works as above. For the other thing, we'd fucking know, exactly in the way and probably to the degree we know of Christianity as a thing, which is exactly the degree required here (and yes, it did succeed in convincing women they were "the brides of Christ" - now if that's not substitute buttseks you tell me wtf it is). And in light of this example, consider the chances of a <em>secret</em> Christianity that didn't preach love and understanding but... uhm I'm not even sure. War on Drugs and War on Terrorism ? Srsly nao, it's not gonna fly this thing, and it's quite a lot more than a couple of twists and turns from flight.</p>
<blockquote><p>Not like there are all that many places to work as a professional cryptologist these days</p></blockquote>
<p>Are you <font color=red>C</font><font color=yellow>r</font><font color=blue>A</font><font color=pink>z</font><font color=purple>Y</font> man !? For one thing, von Braun needed extremely expensive toys to do his thing, and so was beholden to anyone with the means. A cryptologist needs nothing. Not even pen and paper. This is one of the major points which Satoshi conveniently proved : practical, useful applied cryptology is a Perelman affair. It doth not even need the "recognition" of the world in the form of prizes, certificates or whatever bullshit. It needs nothing at all.</p>
<p>Moreover, consider <a href=https://pthree.org/2014/08/18/whats-the-matter-with-pgp/ >the recently linked</a> article commenting on the same bit of idiocy that started all this. The guy says </p>
<blockquote><p>This post is written by cryptographer Matthew D. Green. As a result, even though I've never heard of Dr. Green, when I read the post, I was expecting something of high caliber. After all, this isn't some random dude on the Internet blowing his horn. THIS IS A GENIUNE CRYPTOGRAPHER. </p></blockquote>
<p>Now, does this give you the general impression that cryptologists are in ample supply and short demand, in this world we live in ? Like, consider a counterfactual : </p>
<blockquote><p>This post is written by redditor DerpyMcHerp. As a result, even though I've never heard of Drp. McHerp, when I read the post, I was expecting something of high caliber. After all, this isn't some random cryptographer blowing his horn. THIS IS A GENIUNE REDDITOR. </p></blockquote>
<p>Said nobody ever. Without even going into any sort of factual detail, you have got to be kidding me if you intend to seriously argue a brilliant crypto mind has no way to occupy themselves as a going concern. Which is exactly where this goes right back to the article : nobody with a clue and any self respect would work for the USG. Those that do indeed will carry out astounding feats of ‘doublethink’ gymnastics if it means that they can go on in work to their liking and remain fed - the only problem is that the work to their liking wouldn't be work in your, or my, or anyone's estimation. </p>
<p>Which is exactly where we are, good luck trying to get some work done by the leeches who are only there for the meal ticket, and would do anything and say anything just as long as they can keep getting the meal in question. Is Hearn's claim to fame on his own CV that he <em>did something useful</em> or that he <em>worked at</em> someplace or other ? So there you go, all the people who wish to tell people they work at the NSA are working at the NSA. The pay's good, they got dental, <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTow4eQfrIU >they're like a weed in Hitler's bunker</a>. Exactly, but <em>exactly!</em> like a weed in Hitler's bunker, you understand me. </p>
