<p>Altcoin is a straight-up competitor for Bitcoin. I won't bore you with the historical details and piles of insider jokes attendant, let it suffice to say that it's a direct awkisation of the Bitcoin codebase (0.6.something iirc) and nothing else.</p>
<p>Altcoin also has a problem recently, like so : </p>

<p>Let's understand what's going on gazing upon this graph : </p>
<p><a href="http://trilema.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/atc-mining.png"><img src="http://trilema.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/atc-mining.png" alt="atc-mining" title="atc-mining" width="570" height="420" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56074" /></a></p>
<p>Nice, huh ? Now let's try and make sense of it. On the X axis, blocks. On the Y axis, difficulty. The first, purple section represents a normal mining interval : for two weeks miners mined. The second, red interval represents an attack. Someone controlling 100x as much hashpower as the previous group of miners sets to mining. For a vanishingly small interval of about three hours, that someone will receive 99% of the block rewards, corresponding to a total of about 2k blocks. Then difficulty recalibrates, going up 100x. Which takes us to the gray questionmarked third zone. What happens there ? </p>
<p>Suppose the market value of the coin in question is just about at the level implied by the purple zone. The attacker loses nothing by dumping 100x as much hashpower on this chain for a few hours : the coins he gets are minted at the previous difficulty. Whether he had mined slowly or quickly, he gets the same reward, which is why purple and red surfaces occupy the same area : to get x blocks at y difficulty you need z total hashes, no matter in what hash/second debit. After the attacker leaves, however, the good folk of the purple persuasion find themselves into quite the quandry : either support the coin by mining for 2k blocks at 100x the hashpower supported by the fundamentals, or else quit altogether. As before, it doesn't matter at what speed this occurs : they can continue at their purple rate for 140 weeks, or just a little under 3 years, to get to that magical difficulty recalibration block and see difficulty drop 99%. Or else they could maintain the attackers' rate for two weeks just as well, because again, not debit is in question but total hash. Which total hash has a cost, which is fixed.<sup><a href="#footnote_0_56073" id="identifier_0_56073" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="If you're curious, currently something in the 2 to 3 satoshi per MH per day range, which means the dollar cost of one hash currently stands at about 0.00000002 × 600 ÷1000000 ÷ 24 ÷ 3600 = 1.38 to 2.08 × 10-16 dollars.
For comparison : gold costs ~1.3k dollars per ounce. Meanwhile gold also weighs 196.96655 kgs per kmol. Seeing how a troy ounce is 0.031103 kgs, and there's a total of 6.02214129 × 1026 gold atoms in each kmol (as is the case for all substances), it then comes to pass that each ounce contains  ~9.5 × 10 22 gold atoms, making each gold atom worth about 1.36 × 10-20 dollars. So roughly speaking, each hash is worth something like 10k atoms of gold, a subatomic fortune.">i</a></sup></p>

Bitcoin itself had in the past been vulnerable to something very similar, but fortunately that window <a href="http://trilema.com/2013/things-that-matter-these-days-things-that-dont-matter-these-days/">is now closed</a>.</p>

Because that's how systems work in nature.</p>
<p>So for the benefit of all the derps derping about "cryptocurrencies" : there is no such thing. There's Bitcoin and that's it, because there can only be one.

						<p>OK, let's isnert some facts here, as they are sorely needed.  Everything stated below is verifiable to even a mean intelligence.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Someone controlling 100x as much hashpower as the previous group of miners sets to mining. For a vanishingly small interval of about three hours, that someone will receive 99% of the block rewards, corresponding to a total of about 2k blocks.</p>
<p>Not at all.  If you understood bitcoin and its clones, as one would hope, you'd know difficulty goes up at most 4x and down at most 0.25x.  Here difficulty didn't even go up 4x, making your hashrate attack premise over 25 times wrong from the outset.</p>
<p>What happened is, someone mined at about 3.9x prior hashrate, for a little under 4 days (14 day cycle as you know), while they could dump their ATC for BTC scraps.  This has happened a lot with ATC over the last few months.</p>
<p>Said someone leaves once difficulty adusts (here 3.9 times), as they can't sell their future ATC for shit to cover costs.  But nor can the other 25% "standard background" hashrate any more, as they're only earning at 25% the rate, so they give up too.  End result: only suckers standing and ATC hashrate stalls at under 1% of what it was before our 4x multiplier friend comes in.</p>
<p>Further note: ATC difficulty will fall at most 75%, per protocol, not the predicted 93% of the broken bitcoin-asset bot.  So an awful amount of ongoing subsidy required here just to survive.  Rinse, repeat.</p>
<p>This is how all shitcoins ultimately go to the grave.</p>

						<p>The obvious defense for difficulty attacks is to not adjust the difficulty. Instead restrict the number of minted tokens per NTP time period to the protocol schedule and aggregate all block solutions within the interval. This does not induce Vitalik’s weak subjectivity and retains the “longest” (i.e. highest difficulty) chain objectivity. This requires several changes to Nakamoto proof-of-work which I won’t detail here.</p>
<p>Diff Geek’s point about the spiraling down effects of a cratered price is thwarted by preventing an acceleration in the quantity of newly minted tokens along with no adverse effects due to changes in the systemic hashrate. Given the cost-of-production model for market price one might contemplate that difficulty spiking attacks may bump the price to a higher level wherein cascaded network effects may sustain the higher price level. In short a design that is absorbs attacks as a positive contribution, lol.</p>
<p>Thus I conclude that the presumption of this blog — that no altcoins can survive and that the diabolical “Great Reset” scamdemic, complicit Bitcoin is the only one — will be incorrect.</p>

						<p>Gresham’s law contains to your point about selling the weaker horse to buy the stronger. Is everyone without significant exception to acquiesce to CBDCs as the silver to Bitcoin’s gold and accept Marxist devolution thusly self-immolation? Men (as distinct from other blobs of flesh with male genitalia but dysfunctional testosterone) prefer to die for liberty than live as a slave. And not everyone can employ the Bitcoin gold to transact. Some level of market demand will exist for a non-diabolical, <b><i>circulating</i></b> altcoin. If you’re correct as to what Bitcoin is disrupting then the fiat, centralized nature of CBDCs will be disrupted:</p>

						<blockquote><p>Why the hell would you introduce ntp as a dependency ?!</p></blockquote>
<p>NTP intervals as the Schelling point for the block period replaces the block announcement in Nakamoto proof-of-work’s Nash equilibrium. Nakamoto difficulty also requires coarse timestamp coordination. In both the time coordination is erasable, non-reified because it’s irrelevant to the objectivity of the longest difficulty chain. If the time coordination is insufficient the consensus diverges.</p>

<p>Further analysis concludes that weak subjectivity is required for the protocol I posited. That may not be a complete failure though. At least there not nothing-at-stake as in proof-of-stake.</p>

<p>You seem to misconstrue my point? My prior comments were somewhat incoherent. The essence of the problem with proof-of-stake is that there’s nothing-at-stake (no cost to attack it and thus no objective reality) — it’s essentially the delusion of democrazy. That was the point of linking you to my comments at the bottom of the Eth wiki wherein I reiterated the problems with proof-of-stake.</p>
<p>The problem with Nakamoto proof-of-work is that it’s also democrazy because it subjects the major minority to the will of the simple majority aka the 50+% attack. The attack will be profitable via the extortion of censoring transactions. It appears to have been designed for this outcome because eventually the mining reward-based Nash equilibrium is lost as the protocol reward shrinks relative to the transaction fees reward aka incentives compatibility for consensus is lost and an oligarchy must take control to enforce consensus. Bitcoin eventually becomes a permissioned, fiat system and there will be only one sovereign who controls it. It’s Biblical.</p>
<p>The design I vaguely contemplated and posited may be the only alternative. I essentially posit to combine proof-of-work to eliminate nothing-at-stake with the objectivity of being there in real-time (a facet of proof-of-stake without the nothing-at-stake) to eliminate the weakness of Bitcoin — i.e. 50+% attacks are eliminated. The tradeoff is that my design has no prima facie objectivity for those who weren’t there in real-time, so they’ll need to trust someone that was and thus the analogy to a WoT and my reference to Vitalik's weak subjectivity but that shouldn’t be conflated with nothing-at-stake. Yet there’s still prima facie objectivity as the amount of proof-of-work that has been burned and thus the value of that blockchain — thus ultimately the non-fraudulent chain should eventually become the longest difficulty chain possessing the prima facie objectivity of Bitcoin after all, without Bitcoin’s major flaw. And after further thought I do believe the design I’m contemplating converges on consensus. The key distinction is that the reward for consensus the cost of loss of value of all one’s investment in the tokens instead of the mining reward. All those who are sufficiently vested will not form a consensus around the longest difficulty chain which is a fraud (as they observed it in real-time) because if fraud can succeed then their investment is ultimately worthless. Thus my design allows for fraud chains to fork off in their 50+% uneconomic, democrazy delusion whilst the vested economic majority are unaffected.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is my <a href='http://trilema.com/2012/why-its-not-actually-in-your-best-interest-to-allow-a-hired-third-party-to-speak-for-you-in-criminal-proceedings/#comment-157612'>comeback ticket</a>.</p>
