Well, it says all that minus the thanks, really. As if people can or may even dare suggest they could do such a thing. I suppose the next step down outrage path is what, quarrel among `title holders` resulting in me having to forget Snow White because some schmuck in Kennebunkport, Maine figures it's his right ?

<p>Be advised that this thing is monstruously long.</em></ul>
<p>For five years I have been a recluse. I don't leave the house for months at a time <a href="#footnote_severity"><sup>1</sup></a>. I venture out into the world only when it is necessary to maintain my isolation. I'm not agoraphobic, I'm not depressed<sup><a href="#footnote_1_52053" id="identifier_1_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Notwithstanding pseudoscinetific views widely held in the US for purely economic reasons, depression is a transient, physiologically normal state, much like being hungry, or needing to take a crap. You can't `be` depressed anymore than you can be happy, it never lasts, it's not a thing to be. You can be boring, or obnoxious, and if you identify as `depressed` you're probably both, plus a healthy side of  lazy and conceited. Obviously there's good money to be made from `treating` the lazy, conceited, boring assholes of this world with holy water.">ii</a></sup>, and I'm not insane <a href="#footnote_psychosis"><sup>2</sup></a>. I simply don't socialize. </p>
<p>There are a lot of names for people like me. We are called shut-ins, hermits, recluses and so on. These words mean different things depending on what media you have been exposed to. To some, a hermit is a monastic human living high in the Himalayas connecting with his inner self through meditation and isolation. Some picture a crazy, bearded, old fellow, cooking up whiskey deep in the Appalachian wilderness. Some picture a Howard Hughes type, they imagine man that harvests his fignernails and wears tinfoil hats to keep the aliens out.  </p>
<p>Preconceptions are a difficult thing to overcome. The meanings we assume of words are our biggest obstacle to communication. Instead of fighting an uphill battle against meanings, let us leave the words we know behind and introduce a new one.<sup><a href="#footnote_2_52053" id="identifier_2_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="To quote an earlier article dealing with a strikingly similar asshole (except an old woman rather than a young boy),
I get it, the ignorant love their ignorance, and replacing a common word that has lost all its ignorance cachet with a new word or construction that still maintains all the innocent wonder and puzzlement of not knowing what the fuck anything means is a way for these people to derive their stunted version of intellectual pleasure through the abuse of language. The pleasure part does not make abuse any less abuse however, and you are well advised to consider that while raping a woman offers directly the excuse that at least she is being used in a manner in which she was designed to be used, thusly abusing words allows no such excuse. It is indeed a worse crime to be doing this to a word than to do anything you could conceivably do to a woman without using tools.
So, no. The meanings we give words are the one and only platform of communication. They can be checked, verified, adjusted on a temporary basis by convention with the other person or on a permanent basis by their holder alone, but there's nothing else nor should there be anything else. Learn to play the talk game as is with the pieces as they are or learn to do something useful with your hands. No alternatives.">iii</a></sup> </p>
<p><em>Hikikomori</em> is a Japanese word which means "pulling inward". It has been used as a label to describe an emerging phenomenon in Japan, that of adolescents withdrawing from the world. We aren't going to stick to any hard definitions of <em>hikikimori</em>. Instead, we are going to use it only as a convenient placeholder to refer to a spectrum of individuals similar to, but not necessarily, like me.<sup><a href="#footnote_3_52053" id="identifier_3_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The proposition that people living in a completely different culture a world away are `similar` is preposterous.">iv</a></sup> </p>
<p>The label will be used as a tool in uncovering meaning, it wont be the meaning; meaning is not a label. Set aside any biases, hold back any prejudices and save judgment for later. We can always figure out how to flame me later. Complimentary rocks and pitchforks will be provided next to the comment section.<sup><a href="#footnote_4_52053" id="identifier_4_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Sounds more like this runover squirrel is a case for custom made really tiny instruments, but whatever.">v</a></sup></p>
<p>You don't just get up one day and say <em>"Fuck it, people suck. I'm not going out anymore"</em>. It's not that you cant do that, believe me, there are people that can and do, it's just that the world wont let you. If you just quit the world immediately, without any warning, then the world freaks out; a million text messages will be sent, cops will be called to check on you, interventions will be held, walruses will be dispatched on rescue scooters.

<p>The point is that you cant just up and quit the world. To leave the world completely one has to cut ties slowly and steadily. You have to tug, warp, twist and tear at your connections until they're stressed enough to break. It takes systematic and conscious effort to leave the world.</p>
<p>It takes a <em>"special"</em> type of person to be willing to be push everything and everyone away until nothing is left. To understand how I became such a "special" person, we have to start at my beginning. This is the story of how I faded from the world.</p>

<p>Humans abhor things without labels. It's in our nature to label anything new we encounter. If we cant label it, then we ignore it. If that fails, then we get rid of it or kill it. When I was born humanity already had labels ready for me.</p>
<p>I entered the world on June 15th, 1990 at sometime in the afternoon. I cant remember exactly when, but I imagine it was at convenient moment for all involved. I have always been very tuned to the needs of others and surely would have arrived at a prearranged time. My name would be Kenneth Luke Erickson. I'd be male. I'd like blue. I would be a Gemini. I would be Christian. They'd chop off some of my penis so I'd never forget that last one<sup><a href="#footnote_16_52053" id="identifier_16_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I thought you got your skin chopped off either if you're Jewish to forever remember some obscure point of Jewish legal bickering, or else if you're from the US to forever remember you were born among stupid people that compensate as best they can for their lack of intelligence by following trends.

<p>My first name meant I'd be ruggedly handsome and one day like riding horses and impressing ladies by showing off my manliness in rituals of masculinity; if my mom only knew what the name Kenny would come to represent for my generation. Throughout my childhood the southpark comparisons were endless. I liked hoodies okay. The name would eventually start to be associated with effeminate gay men. Funny how names do that, they're like a pendulum, one generation a name cane mean masculinity, and the next not. The Jason's being born today better watch out. In ten years when people think of Jason they might not think Jason Statham<sup><a href="#footnote_17_52053" id="identifier_17_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I still can't believe that guy managed to parlay a middling performance in an exceptionally vibrant role Ritchie wrote into some sort of pop career, doing wrestling promotionals or whatever the hell he's doing.

<p>My middle name gave me all the attributes of my Grandfather. I'd be French Canadian. I'd have an addictive personality. I'd be introverted and obsessive. I'd be just like him.</p>
<p>My last name meant I was 25% Norwegian and my fathers son, which meant nothing. My father was a deadbeat, a drug addict, a loser, I'd be nothing like him. I'd look a lot like him, but I'd be nothing like him.<sup><a href="#footnote_19_52053" id="identifier_19_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Sigmund Freud, Marcus Aurelius, Sarah Bernhardt, Jean Cocteau, Salivor Dali, Isadora Duncan, Thomas Edison, Ben Franklin, Jimi Hendrix, John Keats, Paracelsus, E. A. Poe, de Richelieu, Shelly, Walter Scott, Jules Verne, Stephen King, George Carlin, Philip K. Dick, Charles Dickens and I could go on, and on, and onnnnnn. What do these people have in common ? Why, they were all deadbeats and they were all losers, and more importantly they were all drug addicts. 
Yeah, that's right. I guess it's not okay to zing niggers these days but it's quite okay to zing WW2 vets, notwithstanding that niggers don't count for shit in the world strictly because they're lazy and stupid, whereas WW2 vets don't count for much in the world anymore simply because they're old, and while you too will one day be old, there's no reason you too will one day be lazy, let alone stupid. And just so, it's okay to zing drug users, they're the uncool minority, and so political correctness (you know, that splendiferous shield of the faux-helpless and pseudo-minoritarian) doesn't bother protecting them. It's got much better things to cover than these guys, like for instance faggots. Those gotta be protected seeing how they're all rich and important and so it's quite lucrative, protecting the poor helpless rich important people. Whereas any dollar druggies got that they manage to keep from the dealer is definitely going to the state with the new pseudo-legal system they've got going in the US these days, and so... fuck them.
Not as much as pedophiles, mind you, the undisputed star on the list of minority groups that need no protection, being that they have no power and no defense and everyone shits on them. 
Appreciate the irony if you will, while I line up some prime coke. So some asshole kid who figures he's entitled to any liberty he may conceive, regardless if that liberty can even be meaningfully expressed or in any way backed in reality, some asshole kid who figures he's entitled to any choice he may dream up and further entitled to complete immunity and absolute insulation from any conceivable consequence of any possible choice (just as long as he doesn't want it, you know how that goes, much like rape) meanwhile has the unmitigated gall to speak ill of his father's liberties and choices. You read it here first, he's just that special, and while not in any way remarkable, important, powerful or valuable he's still in his own mind entitled to the entire world changing so as to fit him just as it does for me. Because why not, right ? Everyone's entitled.

<p>My earliest memories are fuzzy. They are not cognitive like my other memories. They come in flashes of emotions, sensations and visual images. They blur together and I often have trouble distinguishing between what really happened and what my brain has inserted to fill in the blanks.<sup><a href="#footnote_22_52053" id="identifier_22_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This is quite universally human.">xxiii</a></sup> </p>
<p>My early years are not something my mom talks about much, I guess it's too painful. I have zero contact with my Father's side of the family; so what little I know about my early years are fragments gleaned from memories and from my Mom. What I do know is that I was a very quiet baby. So quiet in fact, that my Mom once made me cry to determine if I was even capable of crying.</p>
<p>I do remember that I had a rich imaginative life and liked being the center of attention. My mom ran a large daycare and I spent a lot of time being the clown.  </p>
<p>Most of my memories from this time period are from my Grandmother's house. I loved her house, not because I was particularly fond of her (although she did bake excellent cookies) but because she had a pool, and I absolutely loved the water <a href="#footnote_swimming"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Most of my thoughts from this time period were spent reflecting on the next time I'd get to swim. I was apparently quite fearless around water and had to be watched carefully. Around water, if I was left unattended, for even a moment, I'd go jumping into the deep-end.</p>
<p>Water was a sensory escape from a world I found overwhelming. Underwater everything was dampened. Underwater the world was quiet, calm, predictable, and above all, free of hostile human voices. When I was underwater, for a brief moment, I could have no worries, no cares and no concerns. Underwater I just was. I'd let the water overtake my senses and I would fade away into my mind. To this day, I cant survive mentally without a daily shower. Although I have since learned to replicate the quiet of showers with the power of headphones.</p>
<p>I have never known my Dad. My mom left him when I was four. They were both drug users and to escape the drug usage my mom left him. I have only blurry memories of him. None of my memories of him are positive. I imagine this is not because he was a particularly bad person it's just that only the strong memories stick in a four years old mind. </p>
<p>I remember being terrified to go on visits with him. I remember being so terrified at the prospect of a visit that I would wet myself.<sup><a href="#footnote_23_52053" id="identifier_23_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I think the comparative is misused. This kid wetting himself doesn't on the face of it suggest the stimulus is in anyway more intense or anything, he's just a weird kid like that.">xxiv</a></sup> I don't know if my fear was due to psychological issues or if he was dangerously violent. I don't remember ever being hit by him but I do remember him hitting a lot of things. My impression has been confirmed by my mom. She has said that he was the type of man that was violent against things not people. </p>
<p>My only real insights into my Father have been gleamed through other family members and my brief visit with him eleven years ago. I prefer not to speculate further on the attributes of a man I have never known, so I'll leave off my discussion of him here.</p>
<p>All in all, I imagine it was very a good thing that my mom left him and went to live with my Grandfather,  which brings me to the next chapter of my life.</p>

    <a name="footnote_swimming" href="#"></a>Unfortunately for me, my Mom has never been a big fan of swimming. Although, on some level this helped, she would keep me enrolled in swimming lessons on a almost constant basis until I was eleven. There was no protest from me, I loved swimming.</li>

<p>When I was four my mom relocated us to live with my Grandfather. My Grandfather was retired and spent most of his time traveling around the country in a VW Camper. His home base, the place where we would live, was a cabin in Idyllwild CA, a small town nestled in the mountains above Palm Springs. </p>
<p>It was quite a drastic change from the chaos riddled life I was used to. Instead of a zillion daycare kids around it was just me and my mom all day. There were no arguments, no fights and no worries about visitation. I felt safe and secure. Plus, the first four years of my life had been way too noisy, I needed some quiet. I have a lot of memories from this period of my life, all of them positive. </p>
<p>Moving to the cabin afforded me a lot of quiet time for expanding my imagination and exploring the nearby woods.<sup><a href="#footnote_24_52053" id="identifier_24_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Speaking of weird kids `exploring the woods`, ever seen Spielen wir Liebe (Maladolescenza) ? What did you think ?">xxv</a></sup> The one on one attention from my mom (who was struggling to leave drugs behind and thus not working) is likely the basis of much of my cognitive development. We spent most of the day playing a variety of games and reading.<sup><a href="#footnote_25_52053" id="identifier_25_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Incidentally, the young woman with cub is one of the strongest images of mankind, and I'm entirely unsure why we broadcast that dorky guy through SETI all those years. Seriously, watch twentysomethings playing with their five year olds, snap a bunch of pictures, stylize one with a boy and that's it, that's the human species. And speaking of which, most sane countries afford the woman a year's worth of maternity leave, but I suppose they go about it wrongly, it's wasted around birth. Give the woman six months when she gives birth and a further six months when the kid's five, that summer, March to October. Best single move to improve any country you could make.">xxvi</a></sup></p>
<p>I don't know if I have always had a visual memory but my first memories of using it are from around this time. My favorite genre of games were memory games, more specifically, matching games. Y'know, the one were you flip over cards and remember their location. I became so adept at it that I could easily and consistently defeat adults. </p>
<p>The phenomena of, irritated adult wants a rematch repeated itself throughout my childhood. Unbeknown to them, I was so addicted that I'd often lose or win by a slight margin to goat them into a rematch. Even then, I was able to make up for my social disabilities by a keen awareness of human psychology. </p>
<p>My naturally mnemonic memory has been a main driver in my approach to learning ever since. Although at times, I have used it as a crutch to avoid actually learning. It's surprisingly easy to fake your way through multiple choice tests.</p>
<p>For most of my early years I was aware that I didn't fit in but blissfully unaware why. I was weird and not the kind of weird that garners positive attention either. You know the type, they're the kids that say the darndest things. Everyone compliments those kids and showers them with attention. Those kids win friends and influence adults. They go on to be full of themselves, incapable of growth and afraid of failure.<sup><a href="#footnote_26_52053" id="identifier_26_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This is not true. I was one such kid, and I'm perfectly unafraid of failure. I guess perhaps failure is afraid of me, but that's an entirely different story. To cut it short : sometimes those better than you actually are better than you, in every way, without remainder. It happens, the world isn't like cinema, centered on each viewer personally.">xxvii</a></sup></p>
<p>I pushed kids away and adult saw me as someone that needed help. Not only did the other kids dislike me because I was strange, but then their parents would force them to say hello to me. Believe me, forced hellos are enough to make any kid into a sociopath.<sup><a href="#footnote_27_52053" id="identifier_27_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="In any case forcing kids to say hi to the retarded/weirdo of the group is abuse, and of the worst kind. Some kids may enjoy being passed around to be finger fucked by a bunch of lecherous old men, no kids enjoy being forced to say hi to the weirdo. 
So: next time you feel the urge to conform and play the high and mighty liberated libertard, please, think of the children. You wouldn't take them to a lemon party to be passed around and fingerfucked, would you ? Just say no to child abuse, starting with not abusing your own children for your own, pettily misconstrued political goals.">xxviii</a></sup> I just wasn't very good at accumulating friends or unlocking achievements. </p>
<p>Sometime in 95 my Grandfather, Mom and I undertook an epic eight month road trip. I indulged my curiosity, developed a love of camping, hiking and the wilderness <a href="#footnote_ironywild"><sup>1</sup></a>. It was during this trip that I had my encounter with an insight lacking mine tour guide.</p>
<p>Tour Guide:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Does anyone have any questions?" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"How did they get all those lights down here?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone promptly burst out laughing at the adorable five year old. I was crushed. Not only did these humans find my question laughable but more importantly, no one bothered answering me. Wasn't this a perfectly normal question? Was it not worth responding to? </p>
<p>What kind of unqualified tour guide was this? Shouldn't he know something as fundamental as lighting of the cave? He works here every weekend and he has never bothered asking about the lights? Wait, why are they laughing? Is the tour guide doing one of his impressions again? Cant he take his job seriously!!?<sup><a href="#footnote_28_52053" id="identifier_28_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="As ridiculous as this may sound on the face, it is a common complaint of the highly functioning autist. In fact a surprisingly large number of kids that `can't` do all sorts of things in school can do them just fine once someone sits them down and clears up whatever broken presumption they're spinning on, like for instance why are fractions written this way other than that (pure convention without further meaning) or why does 3 xor 3 equal 000 (1000 truncated to the last three digits) even if 3 * 3 equals 1001(2) (the logic/arithmetic operand mapping is pure coincidence without further meaning) and so on.  ">xxix</a></sup></p>
<p>I now know there was nothing sinister going on. Laugher is a typical reaction to autistic type questions, normal humans don't care about light bulbs. How many humans does it take to screw in a light bulb? Answer: no one gives a fuck.<sup><a href="#footnote_29_52053" id="identifier_29_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Moreover in this case the question was poorly phrased, in that it was too general for the response sought (but hey, language is for `communication`, not `semantics`, right ?) As stated a sufficient response is that they used a truck, which is also sufficiently banal that it's not worth expressing, hence the laughter. That social convention (the fear of banal) is why a snide response is often offered - such as `Nubian slaves`. To which of course the autist mind will follow up with `why Nubian ?!` and so we can duly respond that `Pubian slaves would have been too outrageous` and that's that, we've made an autist trap. Because stupidity is predictable, and autism is in most practial applications pretentious stupidity just like a very fast car with a malfunctioning steering system is a pretentious bad car.">xxx</a></sup> </p>
<p>For some reason, that perplexes me too this day, adults are unable to mirror <a href="#footnote_monkeythought"><sup>2</sup></a> children. When faced with an intellectually developed child the monkey brain that establishes empathy fails to properly operate and malfunctions. These malfunctions come out as gibberish humans incorrectly refer to as <em>baby talk</em>. You know what <em>baby talk</em> is? It's a baby attempting to speak their native language. Your baby is trying to speak properly, maybe you should do the same.<sup><a href="#footnote_30_52053" id="identifier_30_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="But Santa speaks the language of all children! A notchie watchie dotchie do!">xxxi</a></sup></p>
<p>Somewhere out there, there is a cognitively aware baby that feels relentlessly mocked by humans that think they're bonding with him or her. They'll realize something is wrong when he or she grows up to be a serial killer.<sup><a href="#footnote_31_52053" id="identifier_31_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="More like it, the pompous asshole baby grows up to be a nothing at all. Being a serial killer is hard work, certainly harder work than starting a successful start-up. Perhaps not quite to the degree the relative proportion of serial killers (a few dozens) to successful start-ups (a few tens of thousands) may suggest, but still.">xxxii</a></sup></p>
<p>This was my first realization that something was different about me.<sup><a href="#footnote_32_52053" id="identifier_32_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Which is part and parcel of normal individuation in humans. Most people alive still recall the event in their early childhood that triggered their individuation process, but the ones that don't specifically recall the trigger still went through it just the same and forgot all about it. It's about as physiological as the closing of the aortic shunt.">xxxiii</a></sup> At the time, this event destroyed a great deal of my willingness to ask questions. I carried this memory around with me like a battle scar on my hippocampus <a href="#footnote_memorycampus"><sup>3</sup></a>. This wouldn't be the only incident nor the most significant, but it is definitely my earliest. </p>
<p>All this is quiet strange, because I don't think anyone else has lost any sleep over my traumatizing memory, but I like to imagine someone did. I call him Jason.</p>
<p>Jason was just nineteen when it happened. He just stood by while a five year old was severely traumatized by an ignorant mine tour guide. It wasn't that he couldn't see what was happening, it was that he was too afraid to do anything. You see, Jason had been bullied in middle school by the merciless tour guide Dick. Dick himself, had been teased endlessly for his unfortunate first name and he in turn, took out that pain on Jason.<sup><a href="#footnote_33_52053" id="identifier_33_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Contrary to pop-pedagogy, this entire circle-of-bullying theory is just as much bullshit. People bully people because the social hierarchy must be constructed, and as a central element to social stability its importance far exceeds any individual inconvenience its emergence may cause. It's true that all people that bully were in their turn bullied, because in any functioning society everyone was bullied, and if they weren't there's nobody to sit around and contemplate the fact as the whole world simply collapsed just like a mammoth without a bone in its body. An equally strong argument would be to say that cancer causes people to have sex so their offspring may in turn get cancer. While it's true that anyone who ever had sex comes out of people who in turn had sex, and it's also true that anyone who ever had cancer also comes out of people who had sex, nevertheless the train stops there. No causation whatsoever, sex being ubiquitous doesn't mean it also is the `cause` of any particular turn of ulterior events.
The political stake, of course, is that the state would like to significantly expand its self-declared `monopoly on violence` alllll the way into social hierarchy formation, in a vain hope that should it somehow become able to control societal hierarchies it will then become able to ensure its own survival. Neither prong of this strategy works in practice (yes, it's been tried to death, in no way a novel notion). This amusingly happens just as said `monopoly on violence` was violently shown to be a sham exactly every time anyone felt like bothering with it. It's the determined man who holds the monopoly on violence, be he a `terrorist` or `law enforcement officer`, and no corporation may ever obtain this fearsome lightning for itself no matter what happens.">xxxiv</a></sup></p>
<p>After that day, Jason was so traumatized that he went from being the star of the police academy to being such a disappointment that everyone was surprised he even made it on the force. I like to flash ten years into the future of Jason's life and imagine him then. His dreams are so haunted by my face that to sleep at night Jason has to take two Ambien. Even with the meds, there are still nights where he wakes up screaming and covered in sweat, my brown eyes gradually fading from his retinas.<sup><a href="#footnote_34_52053" id="identifier_34_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Admire the beauty of the Internet : this kid needs to understand that he doesn't matter. He's never going to however, especially not with people like me reading and commenting his natter. My incentives to do so have absolutely nothing to do with him personally, but good luck explaining to any one dork that he's simply a very convenient and well articulated stereotype of dorkdom rather than in any way personally relevant or important. You've got better chances making a ditzy fucktoy realise that all you care about is the firmness of her tits - and for that matter, why would you do such a thing ?!">xxxv</a></sup></p>
<p>Things never worked out for Jason. He lost his highschool sweetheart, a Portuguese skier, when she dumped him and eloped to LA with the Rock Star Tim Minchin. Eventually he recovered emotionally and settled down with Stacy, a cheerleader from his highschool. They got married when she was 18 and he was 21. </p>
<p>Stacy was hot but she was dumb as a doornail. Actually, she was dumber than a doornail, for doornails seemed quite capable of holding things level, something Stacy was incapable of. As a way of coping with his feelings of inadequacy and of course the haunting memories of my face, Jason would constantly remind Stacy of her stupidity. However, unknown to Jason, Stacy was not just dumb, but also vindictive, passive aggressive and most importantly, just a teeny bit psychotic. </p>
<p>Stacy had been slowly poisoning Jason with rat poison for the past three years. Although, for the first one and half years she had mistakenly been using rat feed instead of rat poison. The only side effect was that Jason had grown an extraordinary amount of hair; something researchers in a Texas pharma lab would independently discover years later and market as a cure for baldness. Ironically, one of the symptoms of prolonged rat poison consumption is hair loss. That irony would be lost on Jason as he would be dead, also bald, and one just cant enjoy irony while bald.<sup><a href="#footnote_35_52053" id="identifier_35_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This isn't really irony. It'd have been irony if the rat poison acted like a substitute Viagra and had no further effects. That'd be irony, but you can't appreciate irony when you're a self-consumed asshole. This I say from the bottom of my personal experience.">xxxvi</a></sup> </p>
<p>Eventually Stacy got the hang of it and successfully murdered Jason. It was slow and painful and Jason suffered chronic medical issues for years; and don't forget the chronic psychological issues from my haunting face. Fuck you Jason. </p>
<p>Now that I got that out of my system we can get back on track. Man this writing shit is emotionally difficult. I should take up drinking, move to Southern Idaho and develop paranoid theories about black op government organizations. Probably not though, because Southern Idaho is too much like Utah and paranoia is just so much work. I wonder if I could automate my paranoia or outsource it to an Indian.<sup><a href="#footnote_36_52053" id="identifier_36_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="It's amusingly ironic and ironicly amusing and so on and so forth to see the refuse of our own failed world despise the average representative of the other world. So Carnegie was pretty cool, and this schmuck happened to be born in the place which still to this day benefits, without any gratitude, from the coolness of Carnegie. Does that make them humbly realise that without such luck the Indian would have handed them their ass ? Why... no, of course. How did that quote go, `How many derps does it take to figure out just how derpy they are? Answer: no one gives a fuck.`
Wake up and smell the coffee, dear Anon S. Failure : unlike the Indian, whom we've not seen yet, you we've seen and we know you're scum. It's true that we're still clinging on to this nonsense whereby the taxchest is being misused to give you a much better living standard than the Indian enjoys or you deserve, but have no worry, Bitcoin will be making short work of that within the coming years, and even without Bitcoin it is doomed anyway.">xxxvii</a></sup></p>
<p>It was on this trip that my Mom and Grandfather discovered the beauty that is Northern Idaho. My mom made plans to relocate with her fiance (now ex-husband) and I to North Idaho. A couple years later my Grandfather would follow. I was excited about the prospect of moving but also deeply concerned about leaving my Grandmother's pool behind. One needed to swim as often as possible or risk some sort of unknown serious medical issues or something.</p>

<p>I didn't attend kindergarten until I was six <a href="#footnote_cahomeschooling"><sup>1</sup></a>. My first day started with excitement and curiosity; but also much anxiety. I had many questions but few answers. Why do kids go to school?<sup><a href="#footnote_38_52053" id="identifier_38_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="To have their plurious self centered stupidities beaten out of them by any means necessary so they may be useful to people who are actually important in this world.

Submissively.">xliii</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite my worries, I still anticipated the day with excitement. When the time came, I ventured forth into the school with determination and I imagine much swagger. Then I ran out of the building screaming. I had to be forced to stay. I never was a difficult child, so the extent of said "force" was to walk me back inside. I stayed.<sup><a href="#footnote_43_52053" id="identifier_43_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Cocksucker.">xliv</a></sup></p>

<p><em>facepalm</em> I thought, I'm six, I'm too old for this shit. Only with less french.

I imagined this was due to some sort of secret privileges adults acquired by initiation rights run by Barney <a href="#footnote_barneyilluminati"><sup>3</sup></a>. All hail the Free Barney Masons!</p>
<p>Peace came a few hours later when the teacher finally became fed up with the children and escorted them outside, where I imagined they would be re-educated and learn to act like civilized educated humans.<sup><a href="#footnote_45_52053" id="identifier_45_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This `educated` is starting to sound like wikipedia's queerintellectual.

<p>I found this question absolutely silly. Outside was where the noisy kids just went. Why in the world would I follow them? Outside wasn't even limited to the children from this classroom, outside was populated by an undetermined number of classrooms. I mean, there must be like 100 kids out there, perhaps thousands.

<p>It was possible the other classrooms possessed quiet children and these children had become annoyed by our classrooms populace. Perhaps taking it upon themselves to murder our classroom and wipe the scourge of them from the face of the planet; but I wasn't taken any chances getting caught in the crossfire of an epic school battleground. If Saturday morning cartoons had taught me anything it was that schoolground battles could quickly get out of hand. No way was I going out there.</p>
<p>She informed me that during recess all the kids went out to play. I informed her that this was nice and that this was exactly why I was staying inside. </p>
<p>Teacher:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Kenny, I think you'd like playing outside."</p>

<p>I thought, I can do this... I can kick her in the shin. I'll tell her <em>"if it's so nice outside then she should play outside"</em>. That will put her in her place. And while I'm at it I'll demand SNACKS and that NO ONE be allowed within two feet of my personal space or they will be thrown into a Mortal Kombat arena where they will fight to the death. Come on Kenny, stand up for yourself! </p>
<p>Just imagine you are Kevin Sorbo and she is that evil triple headed dragon. Don't look her in the eyes! That is how she turns you to stone! Close your eyes and just go for it! </p>

<p>I spent the next school year avoiding my one school "friend", a hyperactive kid that managed to injure himself for my entertainment at least twice. I'd like to think he went on to star on some MTV show and made millions injuring himself. Most likely though, he ended up working at MCDonalds and every Friday he gets drunk and drag races his idiot friend Stan.</p>
<p>All through that schoolyear I became thoroughly aware that I was different. My mom did too. That would be the last and only year I attended a public school. I was homeschooled until highschool, at which point I enrolled in a distance education charter school.<sup><a href="#footnote_48_52053" id="identifier_48_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Very bad idea.

He has to go to the local drama club and perform on the stage. He pisses himself or in any way acts indecorously or even ever so slightly deviates from absolutely perfect performance ? He has to go on the fucking TV show and perform live before the whole state. And if he cocks that one up he'd better have made peace with this world, because he's getting sold to the snuff making underground and that'll be the last time he performs on this Earth.

<p>Checkers has a strange community. A few factors have caused this; it's got too many variants, there is no money in it, the number of players is small <a href="#footnote_checkersdecline"><sup>2</sup></a>, and it has a major lack of respect. All these factors combine to create quite the eclectic community <a href="#footnote_kingme"><sup>3</sup></a>. </p>
<p>I began to notice two things about checkers that intrigued me;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This wasn't a simple game. I was continually wiped off the board by players stronger than me. What was this? Can't chickens master checkers? Why was chess so much easier when the rules were so much harder <a href="#footnote_chessvscheckers"><sup>4</sup></a>? Had I been lied to again? Was this another thing society told me that was utterly wrong?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The champions were playing in the same place as me. In chess, the champions were unreachable, they were mysterious enigmas I could only read about. In checkers, I could talk to the World Champion. This both fascinated me and encouraged me to take up the game.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The final catalyst was the fact I lived near a chess senior international master and strong checkers player, Richard Callaghan. Rick was a retired lawyer, former world class correspondence chess player and Virginia state chess champion.</p>
<p>Meeting Rick was the strangest stroke of luck I have ever experienced. I can only imagine how different my life would have been had we never met. At the time, there was only around 150 rated chess players in all of Idaho and he was the only rated checker player in the entire PNW. I was 30 miles from the only chess IM in my entire state! The closest other chess masters lived all the way in Seattle. Rick encouraged me to take up checkers instead of chess and my checkers journey had begun. <a href="#footnote_rick"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

    <a name="footnote_chessvscheckers" href="#"></a>Ignorance persists so heavily around checkers that I feel I have to briefly address it.<br />
      Hell, it's quite possible you think I'm joking. I assure you I am not. Checkers has masters and grandmasters just like chess. Checkers players dedicate significant portions of their lives to it just like chess. All popular checkers variants are well beyond the range of complete understanding by a human.
<p>  Checkers and chess have very different learning curves, produced by the very different qualities they have as games. I'm not going to do a lengthy analysis of the games but I feel it's worth briefly addressing some common ignorance about them.</p>
<p>  It is counterintuitive but too get good at checkers is way harder than chess. This is due to the "critical" nature of the game, one wrong move and it's all over. You cant reposition a piece, there is no backwards. You only have one type of piece. </p>
<p>  To the ignorant, these qualities of checkers seem like they make the game simple, they really just serve make the make the game brutal. In checkers, masters mop the floor with weak amateurs. In chess, weak amateurs routinely go up against masters and even occasionally win. </p>
<p>  Chess lacks criticalness, which makes it much easier to play well. In chess you can conduct yourself on general principles and get by quite well. Checkers is a game of calculation and brute pattern recognition, chess is a game of principles. There is a famous chess quote that say "chess is 99% tactics", this is literally true in checkers. Once you get the hang of learning checkers the learning curve becomes a matter of relentless training. </p>
<p>  In contrast to checkers, learning chess is not linear. It is a very rich game and requires a lot of refocusing. Getting good at chess is relatively easy but moving beyond that requires a study regimen that scarcely resembles checkers. </p>
<p>  Neither game can be said to be more difficult, they're just very different games. If checkers was a sport it would be sprinting and chess would be the biathlon. Both take equal amounts of training, but one has a much clearer path to mastery. After I got good at chess I seemingly hit every pitfall possible, but that is another story. </p>

<h2 id="connection_on_64_squares">Connection on 64 squares</h2>
<p>Checkers and chess for me weren't escapes, they were ways of connecting. On 64 squares I was king! There were no arbitrary socially invented ways of playing chess or checkers, everyone played by the same rules. I wouldn't get in trouble for breaking convention, in fact, any deviation from norms was celebrated as creativity. The only moves that mattered were good ones. On the board I could communicate! On the board I could be aggressive. On the board I didn't have to hide. On the board I was myself.</p>
<p>Checkers and chess were the only worlds that never rejected me. I was measured not by my oddities but my solely on my ability. At chess tournaments I was social, funny (sorta), outgoing (sorta) and confident. It was my element.</p>
<p>In 2002 I went down to Las Vegas for the National Checkers Championship, chaperoned only by my 72 year old Grandfather <a href="#footnote_mentaldevelopment"><sup>1</sup></a>. I had played the previous year and did rather poorly, but was confident that this would be my year. </p>
<p>Without the prying eyes of a mom that expected me to act a certain way I was able to be myself. I was social and let my curious nature take hold. I asked strange questions of checker players. I ate subway every day and learned to converse with security guards and tourists. I laughed and joked and stayed up until all hours watching and playing games.  Hell, I even said hello to drag queens in the elevator <a href="#footnote_dragqueens"><sup>2</sup></a>. Mild social interactions for most, but for me, they were very significant.</p>
<p>Despite some psychological implosions in key rounds I was managed to take 7th place in the minors division. This is the equivalent of a 7th place finish in an under 2200 division of a chess tournament open. For a 12 year old it was not a bad result at all, but was far below my expectations. I was seriously disheartened and demoralized.<sup><a href="#footnote_61_52053" id="identifier_61_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Obviously all those mastered sayan superpowers etc aren't quite working as advertised.">lxii</a></sup></p>
<p>Mid tournament (while just trailing first) I lost a key round against a fellow junior that intentionally harassed me until I lost. It took me awhile to recover and it honestly ruined my tournament. Psychological implosions would later plague my entire chess career.<sup><a href="#footnote_62_52053" id="identifier_62_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="`I suck` just isn't part of the mental universe of the vain failure.

In which context, you can readily understand why he `can't` leave the house.  ">lxiii</a></sup></p>
<p>When I returned home, the financial state of the family had deteriorated (due to divorce) and I knew that would be my last checkers tournament. Tragic, at the time I was progressing at a phenomenal rate and would have likely became a world class player.<sup><a href="#footnote_63_52053" id="identifier_63_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="There's no money in chess, either.

As far as I know, this makes me the youngest world championship challenger in any variant of any board game ever. I would lose the 12 game match 3 1/2 to 6 1/2. </p>
<p>I knew that I was going to have to take up something else if I was going to get to play OTB (over the board) again. I had played chess off and on but started to take it very seriously. Despite my best efforts, I never became more than a strong junior at chess OTB. Although, my results online were quite good. Psychological implosions plagued my tournament results and I never got a handle on them. Some scholastic players nicknamed me the "draw king" for my uncanny ability to turn won positions into draws. </p>
<p>Despite my inability to play to my best I was able to win many scholastic tournaments in Eastern Washington. This gave me just enough confidence to continue playing through much of highschool. All the while, delusionally hoping that one day I'd play just like I did online (I averaged a 2000+ ICC rating).  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, I lived 50 miles form any chess area and was never able to play enough to develop a comfortableness playing over the board.<sup><a href="#footnote_64_52053" id="identifier_64_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Isn't this roughly speaking an hour on the bus ?

<p>My most prized possessions until around thirteen were my checkers books. They were old (some dating to 19th century) and I loved the texture and feeling.

They sit under the huge sign in the evening and admire the skyscraped skyline. Then they decide to split up the buildings : that one's his and this one's mine and so on. Then they quarrel and herpderp on the topic until sleep overcomes them. In the morning they get taken into custody for trespassing and generally being disheveled weird people. At this juncture all the indians but one find out that they do not in fact own the buildings they had allocated to each other the previous day. Because that's not how ownership works in the world that made the buildings, and if it is how it works in their own opinion that really matters very little, as they've not in their lives built as much as an outhouse. The one indian however... he doesn't find any such thing. He maintains that indeed he is the owner of so and so building he's set eyes on for the first time yesterday, many years after the building was built by its builders and delivered to its actual owners. And furthermore, that his fellow indians that managed to sanely cope with the actual reality in the field are... wait fo it... are a different species.
This, obviously, isn't very judicious thinking, at the very least because the retroactive speciation is suspicious in its incredibly politically convenient timing. It didn't occur to him yesterday that them indians are a different species, back before their presence threatened his vanity.

<p>Being different sets you against the grain of the world and going against the world is very dangerous. When you push against culture, culture pushes back. Culture labels and isolates anything different, because anything different is a threat to the survival and propagation of <em>normal</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote_103_52053" id="identifier_103_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="No, actually the reason is that most everything different is stupid, inconvenient and at best useless. This is sometimes not directly obvious to the different in question himself, for a host of reasons such as confirmation bias, selection bias, various self delusions and assorted stupidity. All that notwithstanding, just like a random mutation has pretty good chances of being deleterious, a random `different` whatever it may be has exceptional chances to be either stupid, harmful or at best useless. Often enough it manages to be uselessly stupid and harmful at the same time.">civ</a></sup> Culture only allows differences to exist in a quarantined safe zone.<sup><a href="#footnote_104_52053" id="identifier_104_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="That's one way to put it. The saner way to put it would be that under the light of the sun most differences fail to thirve, because in point of fact most differences actually suck. Like you know, disco hair, or iron underwear, or stilts.">cv</a></sup></p>
<p>Culture turns us into the sum of other people. We cease to have our own identities and become the labels given to us.<sup><a href="#footnote_105_52053" id="identifier_105_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This is a common fear among the desocialised stupid, and it serves as a very effectual support for their own vanity, the thing that got them in the mess in the first place. To represent this, think of a very possessive mother, one that tells her son not to go to town because if he leaves for town he will no longer `be himself` but instead `become a ghost`. This may scare children and very hormonally imbalanced males also known as geldings into cooperation, but really, it's not very healthy. Even if your self-mothering vanity `only means to protect you`, it's protecting you from the wrong things, much like say a plastic bag securely twisted over your head and around your neck : it does indeed protect you from drowning, as it wouldn't let any water through. The only problem being that you're on dry land, and you've got about a minute or so before you're dead. You won't have drowned, however, which I guess is a plus.">cvi</a></sup> You become a label whether you like it or not. You can deny the label all you want but society will treat you like the label anyway. You either accept the label you're given or learn to conform to a different one. A human without a label doesn't exist.</p>
<p>Culture makes certain that anything different is quickly picked out, labeled, processed and put into in it's proper place. When we think of bullying we tend to think of kids being physically or emotionally harassed. Most bullying isn't done by malicious individuals, it's done by the system. Most bullies are unaware that they are simply henchmen of culture; enforcing the definition of normal where ever different is found.<sup><a href="#footnote_106_52053" id="identifier_106_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This is a misrepresentation of fact. While the bullies do proceed with the sound footing of culture understep, and while they are indeed agents, and while `the system` does indeed contribute significantly, nevertheless the entire echafaudage is actually designed to and works to check if whatever difference is healthy enough so that it may long endure. I can see that the availability cascade among all the failures cast aside by this process has created a very firmly held belief that it may only ever have one result, but I can attest that this is untrue. I myself was the weird kid which the other kids ended up capitulating to, and submitting to, and immitating. Not necessarily willingly, and not without a some or a lot of emotional thrashing about that was probably very painful for them. Nevertheless... it's not the case that the process is in any way bad or broken. It's simply the case that you suck, and you failed. Time to give up the pretense and take your place in society. There's nothing wrong with that, after all, find a good girl, raise some children well and in another generation you get another shot. By proxy, but nevertheless, another shot.">cvii</a></sup></p>

<p>Being different means constant pressure from culture to conform. You cant avoid the pressure, you cant rebel against it, you cant rise up and punch it, and you certainly cant ignore it. Normal is everywhere. </p>
<p>It's inevitable that anyone different starts to feel isolated and rejected by the world. When you're constantly reminded that you don't fit in, you eventually give up on fitting in. I gradually gave up on trying to fit in and focused on pretending to fit in.<sup><a href="#footnote_107_52053" id="identifier_107_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Because anything but dropping the stinkin' old monkey off your back.

<h2 id="fake_by_default_">Fake by default.</h2>
<p>For those that are different, labels are survival tools. The labels others give us become our easiest means to avoid hostility. You learn to pick and choose the right label to get the result you need. You cease to be you and become the sum of labels. Gradually you learn to turn off who you are and to become the labels you need to survive. </p>
<p>Don't like the way someone treats you? Play the jerk label. Need to extract yourself from a hostile situation? Play the psychopath label. Want to avoid going to a concert because loud noise overwhelms you? Play the social anxiety label. </p>
<p>It doesn't take long for labels to take over your way of expressing yourself. Falseness has a way of growing until the real you ceases to exist. You become nothing more than the sum of your current labels. You start being fake by default.<sup><a href="#footnote_108_52053" id="identifier_108_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The problem with this touchingly autistic analysis of ununderstood concepts and systems is that there's scarcely any definition available for false so as to contrast with real in this context. When I say `house` to denote a dwelling, am I being false ? Perhaps I've soulsearched for the `real` way one... should (?!) say dwelling and came up with `regjhke`, but abandoned that `truth` in favour of the house `falsehood`. Perhaps I haven't bothered to even look. 
How would you distinguish the true name of a house, and moreover, once you start with this preoccupation how do you distinguish yourself from the very infantile would-be magicians of three millenia ago who imagined that should they figure out god's `true name` they will thus obtain the ultimate phlebotinum, the Tome of Fate ? Isn't it a little sad to be trying to rediscover the roots of alchemy in 2013, completely unaware that that's what you're even attempting ? Does this suggest `different species` or `heinous illiteracy molding on a rotten basis of cultivated stupidity` as the better fitting theory ? 
Because this is the fundamental drawback of spending your time looking at walls instead of reading books, and this is the fundamental problem with reading Hancock, Fort, Cremo and Strieber instead of Russel, Husserl, Descartes and Bergson, and this is why anti-intellectualism can't compete with thinking, and why popculture ensures failure : you end up retracing very old ruts without even the slightest clue as to where they're going, without a trace of recognition or comprehension in your bovine eyes. This is a poor way to spend one's life even should one be immortal ; however one's not immortal. One's not immortal, and precisely because one's not immortal one's much better served by being able to read Ὁ βίος βραχύς ἡ δὲ τέχνη μακρή in its original notation than to pore over the drivel printed by the US drivel-printing industry.
I can definitely see the traces of US imbecillity in the unfortunate path this perhaps-under-other-circumstances-intelligent kid took. He found himself trapped in a confused space made out of outright mendacious relativism, holding that nonvalues under local copyright are even fit to print in the first place, whereas the immortal classics which to this day rule, willing or unwilling, the lives and fates of some ignominous, abject colonists lost somewhere in the middle of nowhere are not really worth their interest. The notion that some Johhny Hayseed may even claim to have received a college degree without attaining as much as fluency in Latin, the presumption to pretend that there have been written by US citizens five novels in the past hundred years, the unmitigated audacity of people who can not light a bulb with a battery and wire to discuss, barely enunciating with their soft palate `the premier engineering and science institution in the world... 
Yes, I can see that he's not much more vain than the unfortunate, unwashed hordes he was spawned by. I can see how the inculture of the mob he lived amongst ruined him, but I can not see that this affords him a second chance. For that matter, everyone's born among the imbecilles, it's part of life's great plan of bullying all people into their proper, rightful and most adequate shape.">cix</a></sup></p>
<p>I was around eleven when my weirdness started to impact my ability to function in the world. My quirks were no longer being ignored by my peers. Around the age of eleven human children begin to take up their sacred duty of protecting normal from whatever may threaten it and I was an enormous threat to normal. I quickly became an enormous target.</p>
<p>I gradually learned to hide all my quirks; to never show my sensory issues <a href="#footnote_senory"><sup>1</sup></a>, to never make strange noises, to never engage in strange behaviors and to speak in a proper human fashion using simple clear words. I had already been the type of person that constantly analyzed human behavior but now I made it a full time project. I learned all the tropes and psychological ways humans communicated. I studied psychology books by the ton.<sup><a href="#footnote_109_52053" id="identifier_109_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Because more is better, that's exactly how this thing works.">cx</a></sup> I spent hours watching and listening to stand up comedy.

<p>Around this time my Mom and my then Step-dad got divorced.

<p>I was emotionally struggling and not a single person cared. I felt so alone and isolated. I felt rejected by everyone. My mom leaned on me for emotional support and responded to any of my cries for help by blaming herself and threatening suicide. I used my new found knowledge from psychology books to try to trace down the source of my problems. If no one else was going to help me then I would. I didn't need anyone.<sup><a href="#footnote_114_52053" id="identifier_114_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This is actually pretty sensible.">cxv</a></sup> </p>
<p>I started to feel that my problems were due to a lack of communication. I don't express my emotions; I'll just start expressing them and it will all work out! Yeah, I can solve this thing, emotions are easy to fix! This is going to be so simple! I would just start communicating to the humans around me and once they understood me then they would be nice! It never occurred to me that mentally ill humans lack rationality. Mentally ill humans are well, mental. You cant expect the mentally ill to act rationally.

<p>Over the years I would learn that most mentally ill humans are ridiculous and completely unpredictable. My expressions of my emotions resulted in my mom threatening suicide (because she "was a piece of shit". her words not mine)<sup><a href="#footnote_116_52053" id="identifier_116_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="In general women saying that is roughly the equivalent of doning fuck-me boots.">cxvii</a></sup>. <em>Kenny, the divorce is not your fault. Kenny, I'm going to kill myself if you don't shut up.</em> To this day I keep things to myself when talking to my mom. </p>
<p>I ended up in counseling.</p>
<p>I was actually excited about the prospect of counseling. After some thought, I begin to warm to the idea. I didn't like the negative stigma of needing help, but I got over it when it occurred to me that no one would ever know. OMG I was finally going to have someone to rant to!</p>
<p>Counselor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Now Kenny everything you say in here is confidential. Except, your mom does have a right to my notes."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well fuck, this is going to be about as useful to me as sun tanning lotion <a href="#footnote_penguins"><sup>3</sup></a> is to a penguin. Now I just have 45 minutes of stressful fakery to look forward to every week. Thanks a lot for all the emotional help.</p>
<p>Does this guy have any idea how emotionally unstable my mom is? How much she will harass me if she finds out I have an emotional problem? Do you know how much she likes to snoop? She'll be getting the notes from this session the moment we leave. I said none of that out loud. If I had, I would have had to kill myself before the age of fourteen just to make the fallout stop.<sup><a href="#footnote_117_52053" id="identifier_117_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Strange.

<p>My first technique was to try shutting off during counseling sessions. However, he became annoying and eventually he wanted responses from me. I played the shy closed off kid that didn't know how to express his emotions verbally. Which ironically, wasn't too far off from what I was. </p>
<p>I eventually learned not just to fake certain behavior but to completely turn myself off. I learned to shut the fuck up and be someone else. My new found abilities made me feel super human but they decreased my ability to connect with the world. Now, I wasn't even vaguely being myself, I was playing a completely different person.

<p>In my teenage years I gradually went from socializing 2-5 times a week to only going out once a week, but that too would decline. By the time I was 16 I socialized only a few times a month.

I chose the latter. I was so fake to all my "friends" that I didn't even care about completely disconnecting from them.  </p>
<p>I reasoned that I was only going to "go monk" for a year or two while I got a business off the ground and became successful. I was going to set the world on fire but that was going to take hard work. In my mind I was better then everyone else. I was more functional, more devoted, more capable and more motivated. I was above the weak humans that needed social interactions.

<p>Fuck. None of that happened. I was eighteen and I had destroyed my first business.</p>
<p>In Feb 2008 I launched a service called PSD2CMS; a PSD to Joomla, Drupal, WP/whatever theme service. It wasn't significantly successful but it was successful enough. I was the first into the game of what would become a sizable market. The theme marketplace was just starting to explode and there was a massive need for such a service. It was the natural iteration of the popular PSD 2 HTML services that existed at the time. It would have been a viable business if I hadn't completed messed it up.</p>
<p>The dream quickly fell apart as my complete lack of experience made a head-on collision with my complete lack of stress coping skills. I must have spent more time closing down the business than I did running it. By the time I had paid off freelancers and refunded angry clients, I had netted about $2500 over six months.<sup><a href="#footnote_128_52053" id="identifier_128_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Work 16 hours a day every day to make money while you sleep!

<p>I was exhausted and I was disheartened at my failure but confident that it was a fluke caused by poor coding skills and a lack of experience. I thought, I'll study web-dev seriously for a year or two and then return to set the world on fire. I was so very wrong.</p>
<h2 id="the_cycle">The cycle</h2>
<p>The last four years of my life have been a series of failures.

So, what I am thinking is that at least you suck massive donkey balls on peanuts, as opposed to all your brothers and sisters in idiocy, who manage to create for themselves uncoverable liabilities to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars. It's something, this. Not much, but still, something.">cxxx</a></sup> Yeah, failure is normal, but what I do is more like failing to fail. I have yet to even get another business off the ground. My rationalization for a couple of years was that I "wasn't ready". I needed more experience! I needed more knowledge! In recent years I have had to get more creative with the lies I tell myself.<sup><a href="#footnote_130_52053" id="identifier_130_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="They're god's honest truth. You need an education before you can proceed in the world, starting with about 6th or 7th grade.">cxxxi</a></sup></p>
<p>Everything goes great at first. Development is smooth, collaborators are excited. We are going to set the world on fire. Eventually the time comes to make the last push towards a launch. This is when it all goes horribly wrong. This is when my psychological issues take hold.</p>
<p>I become unable to take the pressure and start sabotage myself and the project. I always have a set of rationalizations at the ready. I was so busy with client work! So many things went wrong! We made terrible technology choices, we should have gone with <em>tech</em> instead of <em>tech</em>. </p>
<p>I have never intentionally derailed and destroyed my projects. I'm not sitting playing PS3 while the ashes of our ambitions fall around me, it's much more subtle than that. I'm startup mindset incapable. I cant gravitate from one mode to another. I cant pivot from developer to marketer and back again. Development goes fine because I can get into a routine. I wake up every morning and do the same thing all day. Unfortunately, startups are anything but routine.</p>
<p>Startups are unpredictable and chaotic. There are emails from beta testers to answer. There are Skype chats, phone calls, app deployments, support tickets and Apple submission processes. ()((Management is the most important skillset for any business. It can not be faked, it can not be done without. This is why people with any sense that find themselves in his situation seek out a master to own them, and if they are lucky one that's competent might maybe accept them. There's no way around this, impudent cocklets do not set anything on fire. Not the world, not the cunts of the world, not any one single cunt in this world and not even their own ballsack. It's a rule.)) All of these I avoid like the plague. I create problems, because whether I realize it or not, I desperately want to keep my routine. I want to code. I want to solve problems. I want to feed my curiosity addiction. All other things are just distractions.</p>
<p>Regardless of how it happens, it always ends the same way. The project never gets launched and I move on. Sometimes bridges are burnt, other times we part ways with no hard feelings.</p>
<p>All I can say to the people I've failed is that I am sorry. Sorry for letting you all down. Sorry for not being open enough. Sorry for not being honest. Sorry for all the businesses I've destroyed and all the friendships I've strained. Sorry.<sup><a href="#footnote_131_52053" id="identifier_131_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Maybe show up at their funeral ?

<p>If you're fake for long enough you'll eventually start to fake yourself. The same tricks you pull on others you'll start to pull on yourself. And trust me, there is no better person at deceiving you than you. You know all the right things to say to make you feel good. You know all the buttons to push. You know all the quotes, phrases, logic, rationalizations and flashes of epiphany that you'll swallow hook line and sinker. You're your most deceptive foe.

All these other humans need breaks or suffer from burnouts. I'll code for six months without a break. I'm awesome!</p>
<p>When the habit is negative I either ignore it or twist it into something positive. Faults either become necessary sacrifices for my super human powers or they are re-interpreted as strengths. My faults became my strengths and my strengths became the proof of my power. My lack of socializing wasn't a fault, it was a strength. I was better than those weak humans that needed other humans.

<p>I think I might have been a tad delusional. First of all, it turned out to be a lot fucking harder to the learn stuff I wanted to than I thought it would be. I still cut a decade or two of learning down to five years of constant focus, but it did not nearly go as fast I planned. Most importantly, I became addicted to my lifestyle. </p>
<p>In the last couple of years I have intended to leave my hermit lifestyle behind. I was ready learning wise. I was a damn good coder. I had read a ton of business books. My chess was strong. I could do all I wanted and more. I was ready to set the world on fire. I couldn't do it. I had become used to my lifestyle. </p>
<p>I tried turning on the <em>'new me switch'</em>, but I forgot that I still had no idea how to be me in the world. I forgot that I still wasn't normal. I had become less normal than I was before. The real me had become so weird that I didn't dare act even a fragment of my real self. I tried going out a few times but I was so fake that it hurt to breath.

<p>I had become surprisingly adept at faking. I was multitudes better than before. Being a comedy buff had paid off I guess. I could play anyone like a master. I could be outgoing, funny, and social. I had Matt Damon mode at will. </p>

<p>Maybe I'd take up serial womanizing, like that guy in Mad Men. I could do that. But then again, sex is pretty yuck. Wait, I'm stupid, just don't even bother with the sleeping part. If you don't sleep with women they'll assume you're just extra douchey. Okay, I got this, I just need to devise a step by step plan to achieve this identity.

How would I know if the traps worked well? Video evidence? I cant stomach horror films though. Maybe the traps could be non lethal so I could ask them about their effectiveness?

But what would I use for prizes? I guess I could use money. After all, I'll be a super wealthy actor. But what if one of them gets hurt during transportation or has a peanut allergy and dies? What the hell can I do with my new sociopathic skills?</p>
<p>Yeah, so sociopath definitely wasn't going to work out. But unless I was fully 100% fake I really didn't want to bother faking. Why be only half me? Once I realized that I had no choice but to be myself I started to drift.  </p>

<p>When you are so different there is no frame of reference to figure life out. I don't suffer from the normal issues. There is no guidebook for being me.<sup><a href="#footnote_150_52053" id="identifier_150_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This incredibly obnoxious snobbishness of these idiots. Apparently there's a guidebook to being Joe the Plumber, he doesn't have any sort of existential problems that guy, his life is easy, it only sucks being this particular fuckwit. Everyone else is so banal and simple and never runs into any inner conflict or anything.
Here's the kicker : you can interact just fine with people `being fake`, you can't interact with people when you don't admit they're people. That's the problem there, this theoretical `fakeness` is entirely constructed, and for no purpose other than to paper it over.">cli</a></sup> I've had to learn everything from trial and error. I do great when I can generate my own guidebook from feedback in the environment. Progress in programming, chess, checkers, even comedy and writing can all be quantified. But how does one quantify progress psychologically? How do you get measurable feedback about your emotions?</p>
<p>For me growing intellectually or physically is a piece of cake. It's the emotional stuff that throws me totally off course. It's easy to think you're a emo-superman <a href="#footnote_emosuperman"><sup>1</sup></a> when the only one that evaluates you is you. For example, it took me years to learn that my emotional reactions would vary based on environment. I'd get up to speak in front of a group only to realize that holy shit humans aren't like bathroom mirrors. They talk, they lack reflectivity and they laugh when you make funny faces. Driving a car wasn't like NFS. Playing chess online wasn't like over the board. </p>
<p>Each life lesson took years to sink-in. I wrote off every single failure as a fringe event. I had a million explanations. I was tired that day. I drank too much Mountain Dew.<sup><a href="#footnote_151_52053" id="identifier_151_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I knew it.">clii</a></sup> I had a cold. It felt like a green day <a href="#footnote_greenday"><sup>2</sup></a>. I wasn't focused enough.

<p>The truth is a hard pill to swallow. When you do, it's like being orphaned from reality, again and again. Whenever I face myself I quickly rationalize my way back to a place that allows me to continue as I was. Inevitably the problems and stresses pile up until I cant take it. In the last several months I've realized that I have two choices; 1. Learn to be myself <em>OR</em> 2. Fade away completely. </p>
<p>I'm never going to engage in the world unless I connect with it and to connect with it I have to be myself. Basically:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have to name my toaster, imagine the life story of the mailman as a character in a Kaufman esque universe, where his wife is played by his wifes twin sister, one of the sisters was a secret agent but the original wife died, and since the mailman is a sleeper agent from a top secret government project her sister had to step in and play the wife, when they have family dinners she has to quickly change clothes and pretend to be herself;<sup><a href="#footnote_153_52053" id="identifier_153_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="There's nothing either wrong, dangerous, disabling or particularly concerning about this. And besides, it's not a bad story.">cliv</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, I have to share that with person next to me so we can bond over shared interests or something. Yes, I do that. Shut up, it makes me awesome. </p>
<p>I realized this and was going to try be myself. Unfortunately, I have psychological issues (and unfriendly humans) that have made it impossible. In recent weeks I had become depressed. I didn't even know what I was feeling at first. I had never ever been depressed, it's why I could survive emotionally as a shut-in. I thought maybe it was medical issues so I started walking five miles a day <a href="#footnote_medicalissues"><sup>3</sup></a> and taking vitamins. Nothing worked though and I still felt like shit.</p>
<p>It was only the last several weeks that it started to occur to me what I was feeling. It was this thing humans called <em>depression</em> that I heard so much about but never understood. I pushed the feeling deep down and I felt better for a bit, but it was short lived. I made plans to focus really hard for 30 days, I'd finish up important stuff and then deal with my emotions. I would just set my emotions aside for awhile and go on without them. It didn't work.</p>
<p>Depression started to make me feel helpless. It was zapping my productivity and killing my desires. Not one to let me interfere with myself, I set about to fix it. I was not going to be beat by some stupid human emotional weakness. I started to see depression as a problem I could engineer a solution to. I first had to determine the cause.</p>
<p>I had never been depressed before, so what changed? Well, for starters, I had way too many commitments. I had two active projects and a zillion stagnating ones. I had a mail app, a design app, a full-time job<sup><a href="#footnote_154_52053" id="identifier_154_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="No fucking way.
Do you realise what this means ? Jury duty, job... they're among us. Well, you, as I don't live there. They're among you, they're probably dicking about on the ipod right now over there. 
Adorkalypse.">clv</a></sup>, a design discussion site, a game, and I wanted to launch a blog. Yep, I might have just a tad too many commitments.</p>
<p>All these commitments were zapping me of autonomy. I had become a shut-in because I couldn't stand losing self-direction, now I had no self-direction and I was still isolated as fuck. Every day and hour was spent working for someone else, accomplishing their goals not mine. There was no me time. </p>
<p>I had rules to prevent this from happening but I had broken all of them. I started working on client work on weekends. I had stopped being open about schedules and gave vague deadlines for everything. I had stopped communicating properly. I had gradually lost control of the one part of my life I always had control over. Of course I was depressed, I was incapable psychologically of coping with this. I had become 100% fake.</p>
<p>Then, it hit me like whirlwind, I was solving psychological problems, like a programmer. Holy shit, I thought: Can I fix my own mind using the same skills I use to learn things? I'm amazing at learning, if this works, I thought, all my problems will be solved.</p>
<p>That was a few weeks ago. As I started to analyze myself using my re-discovered approach I realized that I was going to have change everything.</p>

<p>I'm taking all the skills I have learned from learning and applying them to my psyche. I'm going to re-build and re-form my emotional centers from the ground up. I'm going to take my unhealthy mental state and refactor it into a functional vibrant self. I'm re-life-ing. </p>
<p>First things first, to become myself, I'm going to have to first learn to be myself. I cant quantify what I am if I'm isolating myself from insight. I'm adopting an open by default approach, both to myself and to others. If you don't like who I am then you can go fuck yourself. The more I want to avoid something the more I'm going to force myself to face it.<sup><a href="#footnote_156_52053" id="identifier_156_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Check it out, he fell on it.

<h3 id="focus_simplify">Focus/Simplify</h3>
<p>You cant solve a problem if you don't even know what it is. You cant be doing one thing and claiming to be doing another. Well you can, you just don't actually make any progress on your problem. If I applied my current approach to life, to programming, I'd be asking questions in the wrong language, about the wrong subject, to the wrong community; I'd be trying to solve a clojure problem by asking ruby questions on stackoverflow.</p>
<p>The way to make sure you are solving the correct problem is to break things down. You have to get so close to the source that no matter how hard you try you cant over complicate it. Everything must be 100% clear or the problem will cease to have actionable solutions. Things have to get so simple that action becomes not just natural, but the default direction.<sup><a href="#footnote_157_52053" id="identifier_157_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="All good points, actually.">clviii</a></sup></p>
<p>I have two major sources of complexity in my current life; 1. I have too many commitments. 2. I live in a toxic environment.</p>
<p>I'm cutting back on my commitments and focusing on low(er) stress ventures. I'll be attempting to make money by writing books (Leanpub here I come)<sup><a href="#footnote_158_52053" id="identifier_158_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="If this works I'll eat my hat.">clix</a></sup>, developing open source software, apps and games. At least for now, I feel I'm not capable of handling SAAS products. Why I tried to do SAAS for so long, I don't know, I guess I'm  stubborn. I will be cutting down any ongoing contract or freelance work to four days a week. I'm tired of killing myself with insane workloads for clients. No more weekends spent working. Sorry, I just cant do it anymore.</p>
<p>I'll be relocating to a better place, one with a community I feel I can get involved in. I am open to relocating anywhere, so feel free to make suggestions. I'm actively looking for a low stress coding job so feel free to checkout my <a href="http://github.com/bookworm">github</a> and send offers my way.<sup><a href="#footnote_159_52053" id="identifier_159_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="No activity, no repositories, no nothing. Le lol.">clx</a></sup> </p>
<h3 id="cut_the_legacy_code">Cut the legacy code</h3>
<p>Like any overcomplicated project, my life has accumulated a bunch of legacy it no longer needs. I'm taking a step back and asking basic questions like; "What is it that I am?" "What is my purpose?" "Do I really need this?" A lot of things that I have accepted, tolerated, or even asked for, I don't actually need. </p>
<p>I'm questioning everything about myself and getting to the heart of what I am. I'm no longer accepting anything from culture, parents, friends, colleagues or society at large that I don't think is rational. I'm not drawing silly lines in the sand but rather maintaining a constant awareness of what I am. I'm to going to be open and have a open mind. I'm going to change, adapt, and constantly refactor myself.</p>
<p>I'm starting off with my name. After some reflection, I have decided my current name is legacy. Western naming conventions come from an outdated era when populations where small and you were unlikely to leave your village. It's ridiculous to hold to things because culture says we should.</p>
<p>I'm dropping my name and following in the footsteps of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM-2030">FM-2030</a> by changing my name to something I choose. I've chosen K-2052. If you need something to verbally call me you can use a phonetic pronunciation of the letter K, i.e Kay. If you need a short version just use "K". i.e <em>"Hey K, did you finish your time machine? Wait K, I think someone might be reading this"</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote_160_52053" id="identifier_160_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Just when you thought it couldn't get more needlessly complicated... but I suppose it's still better than Beyonce or Kayne.">clxi</a></sup> </p>
<p>There is nothing special in my choice of the letter K. Although, in many languages Kay means "water" which is very apt, considering my life long obsession with water. The meaning behind 2052 will be explained soon. Ultimately though, the meaning behind my name is what I give to it. I'm not my labels.</p>
<h3 id="mastery">Mastery</h3>
<p>It's important that I test my social skills, that I make sure I quantify and measure my progress at every turn.<sup><a href="#footnote_161_52053" id="identifier_161_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Yes please. Google Analytics that shit, on a multiple times a day basis. It helps, it matters, it's the future.">clxii</a></sup> No more deluding myself that I can activate my skills whenever I want. If I believe I have a social skill I'm going to force myself to test it out. </p>
<p>I'm focusing on fundamental skills and mastering them absolutely. I'm going to be trying all the human activities I have avoided for so long. It's time I get out, live, and learn all the human things.<sup><a href="#footnote_162_52053" id="identifier_162_52053" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I vote for `Acting in gay pron` as the list starter. It's warm, it's human, it's definitely a skill, why the hell not.">clxiii</a></sup> </p>
<h2 id="the_end">The End</h2>
<p>Publishing this was hard but it felt like my only option. For years I have not been living my life, I have been delaying it. Five years ago I paused my life and now it's time to choose between play or stop. I'm pressing play. The world pushed me and instead of pushing back I hid, now I'm pushing back. I'm determined to be myself no matter the consequences. </p>
<p>I know that facing what I am and facing the world is really going to hurt, but I now know that I can survive it. I know that eventually all pain fades away and you're left with only scars. I know that no matter how shitty my emotions tell me things are, that it's not actually that bad. I'll come out the other side no matter what. I'm going to step once more into the fray, come whatever may.</p>
<p>I still recognize that I'm different, but I now recognize that this doesn't mean I cant fit in. At least, I believe it doesn't. I'm not going to try pretend to be normal anymore, I'm not normal. But I am going to try live my life more connected. I think I can find humans that will accept me, and maybe if I'm just a bit lucky, I'll find a few that are like me. </p>
<p>For now, I'm going to;</p>

<blockquote>I get it, the ignorant love their ignorance, and replacing a common word that has lost all its ignorance cachet with a new word or construction that still maintains all the innocent wonder and puzzlement of not knowing what the fuck anything means is a way for these people to derive their stunted version of intellectual pleasure through the abuse of language. The pleasure part does not make abuse any less abuse however, and you are well advised to consider that while raping a woman offers directly the excuse that at least she is being used in a manner in which she was designed to be used, thusly abusing words allows no such excuse. It is indeed a worse crime to be doing this to a word than to do anything you could conceivably do to a woman without using tools.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, no. The meanings we give words are the one and only platform of communication. They can be checked, verified, adjusted on a temporary basis by convention with the other person or on a permanent basis by their holder alone, but there's nothing else nor <em>should there be</em> anything else.

People bully people because the social hierarchy must be constructed, and as a central element to social stability its importance far exceeds any individual inconvenience its emergence may cause. It's true that all people that bully were in their turn bullied, because in any functioning society everyone was bullied, and if they weren't there's nobody to sit around and contemplate the fact as the whole world simply collapsed just like a mammoth without a bone in its body. An equally strong argument would be to say that cancer causes people to have sex so their offspring may in turn get cancer. While it's true that anyone who ever had sex comes out of people who in turn had sex, and it's also true that anyone who ever had cancer also comes out of people who had sex, nevertheless the train stops there. No causation whatsoever, sex being ubiquitous doesn't mean it also is the "cause" of any particular turn of ulterior events.</p>
<p>The political stake, of course, is that the state would like to significantly expand its self-declared "monopoly on violence" alllll the way into social hierarchy formation, in a vain hope that should it somehow become able to control societal hierarchies it will then become able to ensure its own survival. Neither prong of this strategy works in practice (yes, it's been tried to death, in no way a novel notion). This amusingly happens just as said "monopoly on violence" was violently shown to be a sham exactly every time anyone felt like bothering with it. It's the determined man who holds the monopoly on violence, be he a "terrorist" or "law enforcement officer", and no corporation may ever obtain this fearsome lightning for itself no matter what happens.

The situation is more akin to something like this : a bunch of indians that have lived their entire lives without ever having seen a town happen upon contemporary Hollywood. They sit under the huge sign in the evening and admire the skyscraped skyline. Then they decide to split up the buildings : that one's his and this one's mine and so on. Then they quarrel and herpderp on the topic until sleep overcomes them. In the morning they get taken into custody for trespassing and generally being disheveled weird people. At this juncture all the indians but one find out that they do not in fact own the buildings they had allocated to each other the previous day. Because that's not how ownership works in the world that made the buildings, and if it is how it works in their own opinion that really matters very little, as they've not in their lives built as much as an outhouse. The one indian however... he doesn't find any such thing. He maintains that indeed he is the owner of so and so building he's set eyes on for the first time yesterday, many years after the building was built by its builders and delivered to its actual owners. And furthermore, that his fellow indians that managed to sanely cope with the actual reality in the field are... wait fo it... are a different species.</p>
<p>This, obviously, isn't very judicious thinking, at the very least because the retroactive speciation is suspicious in its incredibly politically convenient timing. It didn't occur to him yesterday that them indians are a different species, back before their presence threatened his vanity. To be perfectly frank, the entire edifice of bullshit speaks quite strongly <em>against</em> the lone indian's intelligence, or in other words you'd have to be pretty fucking dumb to buy this sort of crap.

This may scare children and very hormonally imbalanced males also known as geldings into cooperation, but really, it's not very healthy. Even if your self-mothering vanity "only means to protect you", it's protecting you from the wrong things, much like say a plastic bag securely twisted over your head and around your neck : it does indeed protect you from drowning, as it wouldn't let any water through.

I myself was the weird kid which the other kids ended up capitulating to, and submitting to, and immitating.

This is a poor way to spend one's life even should one be immortal ; however one's not immortal.

						<p>I attempted to re-read this pile of crap, but couldn't actually get through half of it.</p>
<p>The moron in question, "K-2052" whatever, looks exactly like a moronic canadian its approximate age, beard starting to gray, stupid hat, double chin, what have you. It continues activity in the pointless crap a moronic canadian his approximate age would engage, there's a github with "code" that isn't really (but "nobody could accuse it" etc), there's a pinterest full of typically bad hand-drawn cartoons, you know the sort, "it's okay because I make it so plainly obvious I don't even try" and "artistic" crap of moderate kitchiness (also loads of "animals" ie cats), a twitter, a reddit, a whatever...</p>
<p>In retrospect the attention was unjustified. Yes he's representative, the original intuition was quite on point ; but no, he's not representative of anything worth the mention.</p>

						<blockquote><p>
I want to code. I want to solve problems.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I've heard this exact thing in #o not so long ago and even several times in various forms, except it's of course not actual problems that the guy wants to solve but simply more puzzles of the exact sort that fit his narrow, very limited grip (that he perceives however extremely wide and great and all that, of course). Predictably, in the most typical case, he then totally refuses to hear <a href="http://ossasepia.com/2020/04/21/ossasepia-logs-for-08-Feb-2020/#1017844">anything that doesn't fit his expectation</a> and gets all shocked when that doesn't work.</p>
<p>I don't even know if it's an American thing as such, by now I'd be inclined to say it's more widespread really. A few weeks ago it was a Romanian (from Cluj, too!) running into precisely this very same thing and the only difference was one of form really in that he had otherwise clearly a saner social experience so that he didn't run into it head first but nevertheless, once confronted with the fact that no, "more code" is not at all "solving" anything, he... silently faded away.</p>

						<p>Unbeaten children of unraped mothers, it's exactly like building a "civilisation" of sandcastles. </p>
<p>There'd be "walls" of sand, with "towers" of sand having "rooves" of sand made of "wood" (of sand) insidewich, through the "windows" of sand one can perceive "furniture" of sand and generally speaking -- "anything and everything one could expect to see".
