                        <div class="entry">
<p><strong>First off</strong>, to get a methodological point out of the way : beliefs, feelings, more generally speaking mental processes without a concrete reference can nevertheless still be mistaken, and provably so. </p>
<p>One could for instance believe that the number five was given to him by God personally, as a gift. This belief is neither here nor there should that same one propose that 5 + 6 = 7. While his belief as to the source of the number five may be true or false and in any case does not interest us, his proposition about adding five and six is nevertheless wrong.</p>
<p>Another could put forth his imagination of "dragons, superb beings made out of pure energy", and again, this nonsense is neither here nor there - if it interests it would principally be for either aesthetic or psychiatric reasons. However, should that another also propose that his dragons (superb beings made of energy purée) heated a cup of water to boiling while expending no energy whatsoever, that another would be mistaken. Pure and simple, his dragons don't enter in the discussion of water and its heating.</p>
<p>The common way in which naive bystanders fail in evaluating these types of claims is some variation of "if broken once she's a slut", which is to say : if we've already granted that something unlikely may exist, then any further such requests should be granted by default. Plainly stated, the idiocy involved is obvious. Seriously, if you've ever bought a woman lunch you're now to buy all lunches she ever eats ? If you borrow from a bank once they might as well give you the keys to the vaults ? If you've bought a stick of gum from a store six weeks ago you now own that store ? Good luck with all this heh.</p>
<p>Even if requested specifically, one has to bear in mind that the grant creates a difference. Suppose one were to say "God gave me the number five as a personal gift, and this five that he gave me added with six yields eight". Clearly, the thing God gave him, while apparently called "five" in their relationship is in fact what the rest of us knows as two. So, the proper restatement in third voice of that proposition would be that "God gave him two as a personal gift and for some reason called it five". Equivocating between "five" and "the two God gave away and for some reason called five" is obviously improper, and if driven by a profit motive plain and quite prosecutable fraud. Similarly, should the another have specifically requested, "and in the magical land where they live water boils or cools without exchange of energy", then clearly that "water" is in no proper sense water, and while the name may be used, it is used metaphorically, not properly. That "water" is in fact no more water than electromagnetic "bottles" are bottles. You could arguably fill one such "bottle" with fermions of the same "aroma", but you definitely could neither crash it against the bar nor taste the contents. In all such metaphoric contexts, the question is meaningful "you mean the water before the grant, or after ?" or directed at any one ambiguous instance, "which kind of water is this ?". Equivocating between the two is just bad reasoning, of course, except if driven by a profit motive it is, again, mere fraud.</p>
<p><strong>That out of the way</strong>, the historical accident needs to be discussed where for the past fifty or so years, the intellectually broken and practically bankrupt approach to thought championed by the USG and followed by its scant<sup><a href="#footnote_0_57508" id="identifier_0_57508" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Yes, I am aware you believe this constitutes `the entire world`. This belief is descriptive of you, not of the world.">i</a></sup> vassals and satellites has been a Ford-isation of sorts, creating perverse incentives across the board towards the publication of mere words, meaninglessly fashioned together into strings of specified lengths, without further consideration. Originally this worked acceptably for actual science<sup><a href="#footnote_1_57508" id="identifier_1_57508" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="In the sense that pretty much any policy works about as well for actual science, as that's a process driven by individuals not policies and as such evolves for purely individual, entirely un-politic reasons.">ii</a></sup>, but it was disastrous for humanities, which were readily refashioned into simple pseudoscience.<sup><a href="#footnote_2_57508" id="identifier_2_57508" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="There is absolutely no difference between the US school of political science and astrology, today, except for sheer complexity and volume, proxies for the ammount of money poured into it.

<p>Arguably this effect was an unavoidable result of the destructuring of society following WW2, because humanities can only exist as the fruits of the superiority of the socially superior ; may not exist (indeed, may not even be meaningfully defined) in flat societies ; and in all intermediate cases their quality and general development serves well as a proxy for the hierarchy of society : the sharper the angle at the peak of the social pyramid, the more advanced the humanities it can support. Nevertheless, avoidable or not, three decades later the poisonous creatures came home to roost, and the pseudoscientific pursuits that used to be humanities infected otherwise respectable science to the degree that we're now stuck cutting out all of the "Earth science" and large swaths of medicine and biology, not to mention all the economy penned after 1940, because it's cheaper to throw out pasta in which someone's taken a dump and re-make it than to attempt and remove all the fecal matter. </p>
<p><strong>Which brings us to</strong> the point of our discussion today. When confronted with pseudoscience, which is to say any text purporting to discuss science<sup><a href="#footnote_3_57508" id="identifier_3_57508" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="As opposed to fiction, which is entirely broken too but perhaps for different reasons, in different ways and in any case not our concern here.">iv</a></sup>, written after 1940, either in English or by any author living in a vassal or satellite state (NATO is the name of this particular Warsaw pact) <span style="background-color:#d3d3d3" id="select">the proper approach is not to proscribe, but to ignore.</p>
<p>Specifically what I mean is, one shouldn't attempt to further interact with all that shitpile, for instance by trying to create lists of banned expressions, or otherwise some sort of crude implementation of a Bayesian filter or another. One should simply ignore the whole matter wholesale, and then allow the proponents to either introduce their ideas <em>de novo</em>, in the original manner such is handled, or otherwise work themselves dry of spittle and wither away.</p>
<p>This flat, unyielding ignorance-as-the-forerunner-of-oblivion is both perfectly safe<sup><a href="#footnote_4_57508" id="identifier_4_57508" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Since there's no actual value in the subject matter ignored, ignoring it is not unlike ignoring the firm convictions of the mentally ill. Such things exist, people in an asylum somewhere could go on about them at length, what difference does it make ?">v</a></sup> and exactly the adequate pill for the poison in dicussion, because it expends very little productive effort on the part of the productive members of society, while at the same time forcing upon the unproductive the exact Gordian knot they've been trying to talk their way around (and plenty, no doubt, hoped they had succeeded). That knot is of course practice, which is to say : if I were to declare I am ignoring "all that Einstein jazz", all physics penned after 1900 or so, and then built a cathodic tube television that worked just fine without accounting for quantum effects, the trashing and bashing of Einstein fans would be all in vain : I'll just shrug my shoulders, keep building and selling my television sets and care not on whit of whatever they may write.<sup><a href="#footnote_5_57508" id="identifier_5_57508" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Incidentally, this is exactly how Bitcoin has in point of fact worked. In other words, it's not a speculative discussion, but merely a recounting of actual history.">vi</a></sup> Eventually they'll run out of ink, because unlike the productive system of making things, the grant seeking system relies on outside inputs to function.<sup><a href="#footnote_6_57508" id="identifier_6_57508" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Here's a thought for all the `sustainability` scholars, jetting here and there to eat catered meals and sleep in hotels they don't own and can't afford to pay for: when are you going to come up with a `sustainable sustainability research` paradigm ? One where you manage to pay for what you yourselves, personally, consume, out of the value you yourselves personally produce ? No, finding a[nother] sugar Daddy does not count. No, no matter how you disguise it. No, it's not true that `everyone lives off a sugar Daddy. Ready for the most challenging challenge ever ? 
Didn't think so. Now stfu.">vii</a></sup> </p>
<p>While it's true that most objects produced and consumed in a sufficiently advanced society are ideal objects, and while it's true that most people in a socialist/welfarist society are patent idiots (who have no use for ideal objects, and so could be made to value any list of ideal objects in any arbitrary order, just like the primitive minds of the original red skins could be convinced to value the fruits of industry pretty much randomly, and in any case divorcedly from their actual market value), it still doesn't stand that the producers of worthless drivel may create a system where they may thrive that's also stable. </p>
<p><strong>So, this is what is meant</strong> when one says Bitcoin is revolutionary : that the ideas it embodies, and its exact workings, the precise manner in which it <a href="http://trilema.com/2014/the-death-of-taxes/">wages an attrition war</a> <em>it can't lose</em> against <a href="http://trilema.com/2012/the-problem-of-too-much-money/">fiat currency</a>, and the <a href="http://trilema.com/2012/bitcoin-and-the-poor/">welfare state</a> dependent upon that fiat currency, can be readily expanded to other fields. You can wage an attrition war on public idiocy on the same exact paradigm, and obtain - just as definitely and just as certainly - the same exact results : the complete, utter and unavoidable ruin of the pile of nonsense. Without any possible recourse.</p>
<p><strong>PS.</strong> If the idea of throwing out 60 years' worth of pseudoscience masquerading as science seems to you unprecedented, consider that this is merely a result of your very sheltered existence. I have lived it, personally, once before, I'm not discussing imaginations and projections into the future here but mere history. Lived history. Specifically, I still remember the piles of trampled pages, knee thick, in front of various Romanian Universitary libraries, pages that before one winter made perfectly good "science", on Marxism-Leninism and Socialist Economy and Socialist Philosophy (aka Dialectic Materialism) and Socialist-everything. Then after that winter they were pulp, or more properly said, they were officially seen as the pulp that they had always been. And I remember the surprised face of one particular parasite who thought himself a "professor", being thrown out of a second floor window. </p>
<p>Contrary to what you may imagine, cutting off warts - while woefuly deadly to the actual wart - nevertheless does no harm to the healthy body the wart is dragging towards the grave. Romania did a lot better in twenty years after having squished this lice than in the sixty years prior, and so will you. History repeats itself, it's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, the sooner the when, the lower the pain.</p>

						<p>&gt; One where you manage to pay for what you yourselves, personally, consume, out of the value you yourselves personally produce ? No, finding a[nother] sugar Daddy does not count.</p>
<p>This is where we smack against the frailty of meat. Specifically, e.g., George Boole would have run into some problems living off the 'value personally produced' by Boolean algebra, on account of his inconveniently short lifespan.</p>
<p>'And so on, day after day, month after month, year after year -- sometimes, all through life. Sometimes the life of the inventor is not long enough, and other inventors must pick up the problem and continue to search for a solution. 'What if we do it this way?' asks the next inventor.' ('And Suddenly the Inventor Appeared', Altshuller (Eng. translation by L. Shulyak.) W4r3z copy on #b-a somewhere in the logs.)</p>
<p>Some very essential things are only possible with obscenely long 'time horizon' for computed ROI. And time horizons tend to get guillotined just as reliably as necks in historical upheavals. Ask the Russian physicists driving cabs in NYC. I don't expect they're especially thrilled with the fact of being doomed to compete with former professional climatistas in the cab business. (Compete they will.)</p>
<p>AFAIK there is no general-case solution (as discussed in an early English piece on this site, concerning Dooglus.) Known attempts at solutions include 'patron king' (no references needed) and 'monastic order' (as fictionalized in Stephenson's 'Anathem').</p>

<p>But you see, Boole did not pretend he is a scientist of "sustainability", did he ? He did not go around sprouting nonsense about how "for a more perfect produciton of nonsense, "we" need to trade carbon credits", did he ? So no, he's not an example in this discussion.</p>

						<p>That is perfectly fine. In discussion is not research without [obvious] practical utility, but merely pseudoscientific discussions as to how "better" arrange the political affairs. As long as the useless stay out of the political, they retain their intellectual legitimacy and may be financed by whosoever feels inclined. Once they step that threshold however, they can no longer be.</p>

						<p>Pediwikia has following conclusions about Boole:</p>
<p>&gt; Boole's work and that of later logicians initially appeared to have no engineering uses.</p>
<p>&gt; Combining his interests in mathematics and theology, he compared the Christian trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost with the three dimensions of space, and was attracted to the Hebrew conception of God as an absolute unity.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether they are factually true in this case, it's true that many scientists in that age mixed into their work a life force and other "for greater glory" philosophical concepts. In many cases it was only their followers that separated pseudoscience from real science. We can easily presume this is how it works even today, if using other concepts and some magnitudes bigger and messier.</p>
<p> So I really don't see how fight against socialism and bitcoin relates to this.</p>

						<p>Consider the tree in my front yard (or any other green growing thing) that ever grows in the direction of available sunlight, only to be ruthlessly trimmed by cable maintenance crew each year.</p>
<p>At my local uni, a few years ago, just about all of the faculty working in genuinely-physical or pure-mathematical fields were administratively herded into a 'college of physical and mathematical sciences.' (I.e., there is no longer a separate 'department of mathematics' with own funding pool, bureaucratic trappings, etc.) And no prizes for guessing who - weren't. The sinecures are untouchable, and can only die when the entire thing goes south as a going concern. Ending with the expected plethora of newly-minted cabbies.</p>
<p>When the king pays for Boole - we get Boole. When the king pays for climatistas - ditto.</p>

						<p>@<b>Jurov</b> On the other side, I don't see how </p>
<blockquote><p>Combining his interests in mathematics and theology, he compared the Christian trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost with the three dimensions of space, and was attracted to the Hebrew conception of God as an absolute unity.</p></blockquote>
<p>even were it to be accepted as factual and discussion worthy (which it is not, on either count) could then lead to </p>
<blockquote><p>many scientists in that age mixed into their work a life force and other “for greater glory” philosophical concepts</p></blockquote>
<p>Seems akin to saying "MP wrote <a href=http://trilema.com/2012/runcible-doom/ >Runcible Doom</a>" so therefore his Bitcoin writings were "mixed" and it was upon the brazen posteriority to oh so valuably "separate" these, which is patent nonsense. If we're going to do that route may as well say things like "Newton fucked his wife and MP beat his slavegirls, so clearly they had no fucking idea".</p>
<p>Doesn't work, this approach, especially when you stop and look at what nobodies like Iris Marion Young did <em>other than</em> derpage. No Newtons to be had, in the arid field of US official pseudoscience, and the comparison is unduly flattering.</p>

						<p>The question, in my mind, is - where is the black hole which swallowed the kings and the Newtons. And, how to get it to cough them back out again. And does it even have a reverse gear. Or do 'we' have to wait for the rise of other civilizations, with gigantic rat kings presiding over cockroach Newtons...</p>

						<p>Speaking of your latest article, have  you ever heard of <a href="https://www.cos.io/blog/many-labs-4-failure-replicate-mortality-salience-effect-and-without-original-author-involvement">COS</a>?</p>
<blockquote><p>We present results from Many Labs 4, which was designed to investigate whether contact with original authors and other experts improved replication rates for a complex psychological paradigm. However, the project is largely uninformative on that point as, instead, we were unable to replicate the effect of mortality salience on worldview defense under any conditions.</p>
<p>Recent efforts to replicate findings in psychology have been disappointing. There is a general concern among many in the field that a large number of these null replications are because the original findings are false positives, the result of misinterpreting random noise in data as a true pattern or effect.</p>
<p>But, failures to replicate are inherently ambiguous and can result from any number of contextual or procedural factors. Aside from the possibility that the original is a false positive, it may instead be the case that some aspect of the original procedure does not generalize to other contexts or populations, or the procedure may have produced an effect at one point in time but those conditions no longer exist. Or, the phenomena may not be sufficiently understood so as to predict when it will and will not occur (the so-called "hidden moderators" explanation).</p>
<p>Another explanation — often made informally — is that replicators simply lack the necessary expertise to conduct the replication properly. Maybe they botch the implementation of the study or miss critical theoretical considerations that, if corrected, would have led to successful replication. The current study was designed to test this question of researcher expertise by comparing results generated from a research protocol developed in consultation with the original authors to results generated from research protocols designed by replicators with little or no particular expertise in the specific research area. This study is the fourth in our line of "Many Labs" projects, in which we replicate the same findings across many labs around the world to investigate some aspect of replicability.</p>
<p>To look at the effects of original author involvement on replication, we first had to identify a target finding to replicate. Our goal was a finding that was likely to be generally replicable, but that might have substantial variation in replicability due to procedural details (e.g. a finding with strong support but that is thought to require “tricks of the trade” that non-experts might not know about). Most importantly, we had to find key authors or known experts who were willing to help us develop the materials. These goals often conflicted with one another. </p>
<p>We ultimately settled on Terror Management Theory (TMT) as a focus for our efforts. TMT broadly states that a major problem for humans is that we are aware of the inevitability of our own death; thus, we have built-in psychological mechanisms to shield us from being preoccupied with this thought. In consultation with those experts most associated with TMT, we chose Study 1 of Greenberg et al. (1994) for replication. The key finding was that, compared to a control group, U.S. participants who reflected on their own death were higher in worldview defense; that is, they reported a greater preference for an essay writer adopting a pro-U.S. argument than an essay writer adopting an anti-U.S. argument. </p>
<p>We recruited 21 labs across the U.S. to participate in the project. A randomly assigned half of these labs were told which study to replicate, but were prohibited from seeking expert advice (“In House” labs). The remaining half of the labs all followed a set procedure based on the original article, and incorporating modifications, advice, and informal tips gleaned from extensive back-and-forth with multiple original authors (“Author Advised” labs).* In all, the labs collected data from 2,200+ participants.</p>
<p>The goal was to compare the results from labs designing their own replication, essentially from scratch using the published method section, with the labs benefitting from expert guidance. One might expect that the latter labs would have a greater likelihood of replicating the mortality salience effect, or would yield larger effect sizes. However, contrary to our expectation, we found no differences between the In House and Author Advised labs because neither group successfully replicated the mortality salience effect. Across confirmatory and exploratory analyses we found little to no support for the effect of mortality salience on worldview defense at all.</p>
<p>In many respects, this was the worst possible outcome — if there is no effect then we can't really test the metascientific questions about researcher expertise that inspired the project in the first place. Instead, this project ends up being a meaningful datapoint for TMT itself. Despite our best efforts, and a high-powered, multi-lab investigation, we were unable to demonstrate an effect of mortality salience on worldview defense in a highly prototypical TMT design. This does not mean that the effect is not real, but it certainly raises doubts about the robustness of the effect. An ironic possibility is that our methods did not successfully capture the exact fine-grained expertise that we were trying to investigate. However, that itself would be an important finding — ideally, a researcher should be able to replicate a paradigm solely based on information provided in the article or other readily available sources. So, the fact that we were unable to do so despite consulting with original authors and enlisting 21 labs, all of which were highly trained in psychology methods is problematic. </p>
<p>From our perspective, a convincing demonstration of basic mortality salience effects is now necessary to have confidence in this area moving forward. It is indeed possible that mortality salience only influences worldview defense during certain political climates or among catastrophic events (e.g. national terrorist attacks), or other factors explain this failed replication. A robust Registered Report-style study, where outcomes are predicted and analyses are specified in advance, would serve as a critical orienting datapoint to allow these questions to be explored. </p>
<p>Ultimately, because we failed to replicate the mortality salience effect, we cannot speak to whether (or the degree to which) original author involvement improves replication attempts.** Replication is a necessary but messy part of the scientific process, and as psychologists continue replication efforts it remains critical to understand the factors that influence replication success. And, it remains critical to question, and empirically test, our intuitions and assumptions about what might matter.</p>
<p>*At various points we refer to “original authors”. We had extensive communication with several authors of the Greenberg et al., 1994 piece, and others who have published TMT studies. However, that does not mean that all original authors endorsed each of these choices, or still agree with them today. We don’t want to put words in anyone’s mouth, and, indeed, at least one original author expressly indicated that they would not run the study given the timing of the data collection — September 2016 to May 2017, the period leading up to and following the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States. We took steps to address that concern, but none of this means the original authors “endorse” the work.</p></blockquote>

						<p>Can't say as I have, and to my detriment -- there's some serious comedy bricks in there. Then again... this procedure whereby spinsters and wankers self-importantly inquire with "large" (in the sense of, <a href="http://trilema.com/2015/the-genetics-of-intelligence/#footnote_13_60664">small</a>) groups of <a href="http://trilema.com/2014/this-is-just-about-everyone-on-the-internet/">campus ditzes</a> what "their feelings" are on whatever X, then meticulously misinterpret the "results" towards whatever <a href="http://trilema.com/2021/covid-is-not-a-hoax-and-assorted-new-bureaucrat-mythology-misinformation-mendacious-if-self-serving-bullshit/">politruk pipe-dreams</a> momentarily fashionable is in no danger of ever being mistaken for science. How's the ozone hole layers doing these days btw ?</p>
<p>In particular these idiots' procedures (and the related "Death Salience" morons, "measuring" word completion for chrissakes, did you complete sk___ with skull more often than with skill ? <a href="http://trilema.com/2021/degeneration-by-max-nordau-adnotated-diagnosis/?b=When,&#038;e=doubled#select">MEASURABLE</a>!!!) come down to just so much repurposed Rorschach. Once that <a href="http://trilema.com/2020/forum-logs-for-23-jan-2018/#2399908">crystal ball</a> crashed open (in ten thousand shards of <a href="http://trilema.com/2019/thelastpsychiatristcom-8-characteristics-of-family-annihilators-adnotated/#footnote_13_85307">laughter</a>), the idiots did what they always do -- moved on. You wouldn't have expected them to <em>learn something</em>, which is to say <em>change</em>, I hope. They can't change, which is why they're <a href="http://trilema.com/2011/strategia-nulitatii/">where they are</a>.</p>
<p>Old gypsy women (which is to say "clever", because hey, under such pressure as a demographic minority experiences in a nation-state, one'd better learn how to be clever) have an equally scientific scrying practice whereby... Actually, <a href="http://trilema.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/an-old-hand.jpg">here</a>, let me return the favour by publicizing some ethnographical notation of my own :</p>
<blockquote><p>Bobii, se aleg 41 de fire de păpuşoi[corn], la nevoie şi altă sămânţă, cum e fasolea, şi se învârt grămăgioară[pile] cu mâna dreaptă în dreapta, cum merge soarele, descântând: "41 de bobi, bine ştiţi, bine gâciţi[guess], dacă va fi să fie bine şi după gând, să pice pe 9, colac în prag şi bucurie într-amândouă mâinile, dar dacă nu, să pice unul şi doi şi să nu se aleagă nimică din voi!" [including the non-tenure threat, fancy that wonder, it's older than dirt!]</p>
<p>Apoi face cruce cu mâna pe grăunţe şi le desparte în trei grămăgioare. O grămăgioară vine de-a stânga, acolo se cheamă "în mână străină", alta în mijloc, se numeşte "în casă", şi a treia în dreapta, aceasta se numeşte "în mâna sa", a celui ce caută.</p>
<p>Din aceste grămăgioare, se numără – începând de la cea din mijloc – câte patru bobi şi tot se dau deoparte, iar cei ce rămân, fie 1, 2, 3 sau 4, se pun în linie sus, făcându-se tot astfeli şi cu celălalte două grămăgioare. Iară bobii rămaşi se amestecă şi iarăşi se face un rând de bobi gâcitori, puindu-se sub rândul de sus. Tot aşa se face şi a treia oară şi restul se dă deoparte, ca netrebuitori.</p>
<p>Bobii – rândul întâi luat în lat, trebuie să cadă pe 5 sau pe 9. De cad pe 5, are să fie lucrul în grabă, de cad pe 9, mai sigur dar mai târziu. 3 fire, unde cad la un loc, e bucurie, 4 sunt vorbe, iar dacă cad 4 bobi la mijloc, în casă, însemnează că eşti plin la inimă, sătul, mulţămit. 2 fire însemnează îndoială sau supărare, 1 e în deşert sau veste, dacă e sus, iară dacă cade jos e bob sositor, are să sosească cineva.</p>
<p>Dacă cad doi câte 1 sau trei în rând, înseamnă drum. 3 dacă cad sus, la mijloc, se numeşte bucurie în cap sau colac. De cad în rândul de jos, la mijloc, e colac în prag. Unul de cade jos în prag, în casă, e bob sositor şi astfeli e bine, se va împlini ce gândeşti, căci e drumul slobod, pe când, dacă sunt 4 jos, în prag, e drumul închis, nu se va împlini sau sunt vorbe.</p>
<p>De-ţi cad în bobi lângă 4, 3 înseamnă vorbe de bucurie; de-ţi cad lângă 4, 1 şi 2 sunt vorbe de supărare şi deşarte. Când cad la mijloc, în curmeziş sau pe jos, tot câte 4 în rând, nu se va împlini ce gândeşti, e închis, sau vei avea proces [legal proceedings], huit [as in hue, of hue-and-cry]. În alte locuri spun că e bine, e masă.</p>
<p>Dacă cad bobii câte 1 şi 2, atunci să n-ai nici o nădejde, că "e mai rar decât apa" [confessing to the practice's desert nomadic roots], nu e nimic în deplin. Dacă însă fiind aşa răi, numărând toţi bobii, găseşti că sunt 17, atunci totul va fi bine. Bobii din mâna stângă arată ce gând are persoana ce ai pus în gând, pentru tine.</p>
<p>Dacă bobii din mâna stângă sunt tocmai aşa ca cei din dreapta, atunci eşti cu aceea gând la gând şi, prin aceasta, se arată dragostea. Bobul sositor din corn, din mâna dreaptă jos, e împlinirea gândului; de sunt mai mulţi bobi în corn, arată întârziere. Bobii ce rămân afară câte 4 se cheamă "mese", dacă sunt mesele cu soţ, e de bine.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am not kidding : if "scientific" means "confirmation" over "large datasets", nothing a coupla dozen "labs" managed over a few grosse silly gooses could possibly compare to the literal millennia of practice here available. <em>Datul in bobi</em> has way the fuck more "data behind it" than anything contemporary niggers could ever hope to achieve -- and the exact same sort of data, too.</p>

					<p>[...] Now, supposing there's two sets, one consisting of a million natural numbers from one to one million, and the other consisting of the numbers 8, 75, 119`500 and 996`000 -- what does the utterance "That 996`000 is a good example of a million" say about the numeral 996`000 ? Nothing at all. At issue is not the value, but its context, what's said's entirely that "the largest value in your set is not so far off from the largest value in my canonical set". That's all ; and the exact same statement could be applied to any other two sets, with whatever other numbers -- it'd still not be about the god damned numbers. I say "it's a good example" because in my moral system goodness of examples is closeness, and my ethical approach readily resolves 996`000 as close enough to 1`000`000 in that context ; no more is involved whatsoever. There's nothing good about the number, there's nothing good about the example. Because I had pre-decided that in the case of examples closeness is what counts for goodness, therefore I said "it's a good example". It's not the number that "earned" it, it's my divine grace that granted it. Sola gratia et gratia sola ; the assignment does not flow the other way, there's nothing in that example that characterizes or qualifies goodness whatsoever. Should all eternity hence be spent assigning "good" to examples involving odd numbers, the "empirical observation" that "there's something about Mary odd numbers" will be and perpetually remain absolutely spurious. Unless and until I declare oddity good, oddity's entirely irrelevant, and stays irrelevant irrespective of "social sciences". [...]</p>
