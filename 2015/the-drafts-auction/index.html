<p>Seeing how the attempt to seed the draft cycle <a href="http://logs.minigame.biz/2015-10-26.log.html#t10:19:26">failed</a>, let's try to seed again. </p>
<p>To go on the block Sunday, November 1st, at 6pm GMT, the following : </p>
<ul>
<li>3 Supplication of Berries Draft, q 100</li>
<p></p>
<li>3 Supplication of Leather Draft, q 100</li>
<p></p>
<li>3 Supplication of Mosses Draft, q 100</li>
<p></p>
<li>3 Supplication of Snails Draft, q 100</li>
<p></p>
<li>3 Supplication of Stones Draft, q 100</li>
<p></p>
<li>3 Supplication of Thorns Draft, q 100</li>
</ul>
<p>The total base value for this being 180 coppers, the auction will start at a record breaking (the other way) 200 coppers. See you then!</p>
