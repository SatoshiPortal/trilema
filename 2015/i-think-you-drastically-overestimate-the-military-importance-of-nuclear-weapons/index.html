<strong>I.

Just about 0.72% of this is usable for the purpose. Uranium molar mass is ~250 [grams/mol] which means ~ 6*10^9 * 1000/250 * 6*10^23 atoms in total. </p>
<p><strong>II. Energy output</strong> is ~200 MeV per fission event. The total ideally available energy is thus 6*10<sup>9</sup> * 0.0072 * 1000 / 250 * 6*10<sup>23</sup> * 200 * 10<sup>6</sup> = ~2 * 10^40 eV. </p>
<p><strong>III. Land surface</strong> is ~1.50 * 10<sup>14</sup> square meters, so on average there's a total of ~1.3 * 10<sup>26</sup> eV available per square meter, ~21 or so MJoules. This means that if there's water on the floor<sup><a href="#footnote_1_61572" id="identifier_1_61572" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Room temperature water costs about 2.6MJ per liter to dry off, and a liter of water stands a milimeter tall on a square meter surface.">ii</a></sup>, eight or so milimeters high, all-out nuclear war will dry it off.<sup><a href="#footnote_2_61572" id="identifier_2_61572" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="We're making the generous assumption that all that energy can in fact be transferred.

</ul>
<p>This, of course, provided you manage to mine all the uranium there is<sup><a href="#footnote_4_61572" id="identifier_4_61572" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Mostly in Australia.">v</a></sup>, and manage to fission it in such a way that no atom escapes your wrath, and further provided that the sea is magically off limits to the enemy.<sup><a href="#footnote_5_61572" id="identifier_5_61572" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Which it very much isn't.

<p>Consider also the problem of costs.</p>

Therefore the entire US atomic armaments (all 1.4 * 10<sup>34</sup> eV's worth of it) come to almost 0.0001% of what's contemplated here. Provided, of course, they <a href="http://trilema.com/forum-logs-for-14-nov-2014#1521856">even work</a>. </p>
<p><strong>For the other thing</strong>, a single Trident missile (which is, as alf well points out, not at all <a href="http://trilema.com/forum-logs-for-26-nov-2014#1536851">the whole story</a>) costs 30 to 40 million dollars, and delivers 15-20 TeraJoules, ideally. The delivery costs of fissile material involved in the Operation Dry Bathroom Floors would alone count for something like... 4 to 5 trillion dollars.<sup><a href="#footnote_7_61572" id="identifier_7_61572" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Provided of course the supply of these things is absolutely elastic, and you can buy ten million for the same price you paid for one.

						<p>Not disputing the numbers, but the conclusion does not follow. A weapon does not need to boil the earth to be effective. Consider an ordinary rifle bullet. Or, for that matter, poison.</p>
<p>Even think of conventional explosive - the energy in a hand-grenade is considerably less than what is contained in a coffee cup of petrol.  To borrow the chemists' parlance, it is the -kinetics- rather than -thermodynamics- of the situation which matter here.</p>
<p>Humans also have a way of concentrating themselves conveniently for the kill, like the proverbial 'fish in a barrel.' - e.g., city, or column of tanks.</p>
<p>Hey, let's do the numbers after all! - 21MJoule ? A heavy anti-aircraft gun yields ~20KJoule on impact. And yes, I would rather take the 20KJoule from being pushed in a car for a hundred metres, than from a direct hit of an antiaircraft cannon, and the 21MJoule by sitting in the sun for a day rather than from a nuke. Why might this be ?</p>

						<p>But the predicate of the effectuality of this particular weapon is specifically that it "would boil the earth". That is why the title reads as it reads - because to many people, nukes are a sort of magical, "will boil the earth" device. They aren't. </p>
<p>The point isn't that they are not useful at all - that'd be ridiculous. The point is that they aren't the magical "press this button to win any war" weapons fat lazy slobs wishing for a magical "press this button to solve any problems" are looking for and thus very likely to "find".</p>
<p>The comparison with the hand grenade and the discussion of kinetics vs thermodynamics is particularly weak. There is no frag nuke. It is a purely thermodynamic weapon, exactly like fuel bombs (which is what they technically are - different type of fuel, just as wasteful and primitive, as <a href=http://btcbase.org/log/?date=11-05-2015#1127660 >decimation well pointed out</a>).  It is altogether improbable that an advanced power in war will find such wastage to its advantage. Germany did not throw gasoline bombs at London for similar reasons.</p>
<p>Human concentration is a thing of Versailles, and thus of the past. That entire model of human civilisation is gone, with "popular democracy" and socialism. Sure, winning the wars of the past is the principal preoccupation of [inept] war planners. Nevertheless, it's neither sensible nor does it win wars.</p>

						<p>The context where I mentioned the atomic weapon was this:</p>
<p>asciilifeform: when it was, instead, 'who has longest sovereignty cock' - folks willingly died for the glory of $empire, yes</p>
<p>and I don't see how the glory of $empire can be maintained if one or few largest centers or "holy shrines" of that civilization get turned into barren wasteland. Not even wasteland - few nukes can be creatively used to disable large part of nation's power transformers, or pipelines/oil refineries... can go on. The entire model of human civilization is not gone, instead its critical points are now elsewhere.</p>

						<p>But the critical points of human civilisation have long been gone out of the physical land. </p>
<p>Think of it in practical terms : both Russia and the US know that China is too large to be effectually nuked, which knowledge quite visibly informs their policy towards it. Now if nukes actually worked... why would this be ?</p>

						<p>The only thing "effectually nuked" means is the very meta "spending a lot of time talking about it as if it were a thing". The bonehead move is to insist it actually means anything other than that.</p>

						<p>I reproduce below a PDF that was originally published by <a href=http://cryptome.org/2015/05/william-mcneilly.pdf >cryptome</a> and graciously de-stupidified (STOP USING PDF OMFG!) <a href=http://dpaste.com/00YX117 >by alf</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p>My name is William McNeilly. I am an Engineering Technician Submariner for the UK's Trident II  D5 Strategic Weapons System. I sent this report on the 05/05/15 to every major newspaper,  freelance journalists, and whistle-blower I could find. It is now the 12/05/15. I’ve had one email  reply; I am a Strategic Weapons Systems engineer who has sacrificed everything to tell the public  how close it is to a nuclear catastrophe. I’ve sacrificed my freedom, time with my family and  friends, a good paying career, my life savings, possibly my life itself; just to get this information out  to the public, and it seems no-one wants to help me inform the public. This is more like David vs  Superman than David vs Goliath, alone I have no chance, but you the people are the kryptonite.  </p>
<p>This is document will enlighten you to the shockingly extreme conditions that our nuclear weapons  system is in right now, and has been in the past. It describes different threats and events that have  happened and are threats that are highly likely to happen; each one individually should raise  maximum concern. I need you to publish this document or send it to someone who will; please, for  the sake of the people and land for generations to come. </p>
<p>This will jump between things like food hygiene and a flooded toilets, till describing the complete  lack of security, floods, forced diving, crashes, N2 leaks, how the system can’t pass tests to show it  could’ve launched, fires such as the blazing inferno in the Missile Compartment… Much more.  My  aim is to paint an overall picture of what I've seen, and to break down the false images of a perfect  system that most people envisage exists. </p>
<p>I gathered the information by: Listening to O Group meetings, reading documents, conversation,  briefs, listening in to conversations and seeing with my own eyes. O Group meetings are meetings  that discuss the incidents onboard and plan all boat evolutions. They are held in the Navigation  centre, which is a Top Secret compartment. My Top Secret clearance is only in the pending position.  I shouldn't have been able to gain entrance to that compartment, but part of my job is Strategic  Weapon System navigation, so they gave me access for training purposes. At the beginning of patrol  I was kicked out of the Navigation centre when O Group were about to begin, but I found a way to  stay. There's a computer down the back that I worked on. Out of sight, out of mind. I could hear  everything, and no-one told me to leave when I was there. </p>
<p>This contains references to CB8890: The instructions for the safety and security of the Trident II D5  strategic weapon system.  I'm sure all the Strategic Weapon System (SWS) personnel are scratching  their heads and wondering how I'm writing this on my personnel laptop and referencing a book,  which is contained within a safe in the Missile Control Centre (MCC). The MCC is the  compartment used to control the launch of the nuclear missiles. It can only be accessed by people  on the access list, and no personnel electronics are allowed. I was on the access list but how could I  have gotten a copy of every single chapter on to my phone? A hidden camera? No. Smuggled the  book out then filmed it? No. What I did was walk into a room were no recording devices are  allowed. I sat down; took my Samsung Galaxy SII (white) out of my pocket, and recorded the entire  book word for word. I held the phone still, about a foot in front of my face and anyone who looked  at the screen or used common sense, would've seen I was recording. There were other SWS  personnel in the room; in the video you can see a SWS JR about 3 feet in front of me talking to  another SWS JR sitting right beside me.  You probably think that's impossible but I've got the  evidence to prove it. The complete lack of concern for security worries me. The fact is it would've  been even easier for me to cause a  nuclear catastrophe than to gather that information, and   gathering that information was actually quite simple, due to the amount of ignorance.     </p>
<p>We are at war, with a new kind of enemy. The terrorists have infiltrated every nation on our planet.  Our nuclear weapons are a target that's wide open to attack. You don't have to be Alexander the  Great to see we must adapt our strategies. The cold war is over; are we still in situation where we   must invest billions upon billions into a system that puts our citizens at risk? NO! We must adapt to  the evolving world in order to survive! </p>
<p>Here's an example of how little people outside of the Trident Program know about the Trident  Program: I was part of a squad that had went through basic training, and had almost finished our  phase 2 weapons engineering training before we knew we would be joining the SWS department  (Strategic Weapons System). We came into contact with a lot of instructors and there was only one  person who knew anything besides the names of the Vanguard class submarines (Trident). The only  reason he knew was because he served on them. There is a strict need to know policy for the HMS  Vanguard class submarines; Regardless of military rank or political authority. </p>
<p>I had envisioned a system with strict security and safety. I didn't see how wrong I was until I arrived  at HMS Neptune, (Faslane) and started doing the dry phase of the submarine qualification (SMQ  Dry). My class sat in a room that overlooked the submarines. We all looked at the defences and  contemplated how any enemy might take one out. We thought of multiple ways that one could be  taking out but they all required military grade equipment. I still thought it was as safe as it gets; no  alarms bells were ringing in my head until the first boat visit. </p>
<p>In the classroom we were told to take all electronic devices out of our pockets, and warned that we  might be searched. We headed down to the final access gate to the Green Area; the last security  check point. Unless you count the Quarter Masters; (QM) I've walked past them so many times  without showing ID that I don't consider them a line of defence. I'll explain those situations later on.  At the gate the guard barely looked at my pass, which was a paper sticker with my face on it;  mounted onto a piece cardboard. The whole group throw their passes into the security office  without the security officer examining them or even showing an interest in having a look to see if  their faces matched the pictures. It's harder to get into most nightclubs than it is to get into the  Green Area. There's still the pin code system to get through the gate! Oh wait, No there's not, it's  broke, and anyone standing there that has thrown their security pass in or NOT, will get buzzed  through. If you have a Green area pass or any old green card you can just show it to them from  about 3 metres away (if the boat's on the first berths; if not 1 metre) then get Buzzed Through!!   That's the toughest part of the security!! There are some security guards that will expect you to put  the pass to the window so they can inspect it, however the vast majority of them don't. </p>
<p>We approached the QM's box to get our security brief then headed down the boat. No search at all.  It wasn't because we're Royal Navy personnel, it was because that's the standard procedures. 100's  of contractors go down the boat when it's alongside. Their equipment isn't searched and they are not  pat down. All it takes is someone to bring a bomb onboard to commit the worst terrorist attack the  UK and the world has ever seen.  A perfect example of how pure the security is, is when I first got  my Green Area Pass I was assigned to a boat which was in the ship lift. It was a rainy dark winter’s  morning. The bus took us down to the gate and about 10 people were about to gain access to the  Green Area at once. We All throw our Green Area North (GAN) passes into a pile in the box;  without showing any ID. Then we all got buzzed through. Anyone without an ID or a GAN pass  could've easily gotten through in the group. This was not a onetime occurrence, it happens every  morning. Sometimes when it was windy and raining I kept my face looking in the complete  opposite direction from the guard so they couldn't see my face; I was still buzzed through. Anyone  can catch that bus from the Yellow Area (normal base area/ area before Red Area). IDs are checked  on the way into the Red Area (Area before Green Area) on the bus; by a guy who just walks up and  down barely looking. I've gotten through a few times by just showing my pale white room key;  looks nothing like a Green Area Pass. Also if you just walk into the Red Area from the Yellow area  most of the time they will look at in your ID from about 4 metres away then till you to go on  through the road part (especially if it's raining). </p>
<p>At a Base security brief we were told that thousands of Royal Navy IDs go missing every year. A  terrorist can use them, or create counterfeits with them and easily gain access down the submarine.  Considering most of the guards barely look at them from a few metres (couple of feet if they’re the  rare ones) away the fakes wouldn't have to be too perfect. I've shown a room card or nothing, at  least once at every check point. </p>
<p>I had gotten into the Green Area in a cluster of  about 10 people and then I found out I needed to go  to the boat that's in the ship lift. I was in a group of six personnel that was going to do BSS on the  boat. Which is basically walking around every compartment onboard learning about the boat. We  went through the ship lift, past the QM, down to MC (Missile Compartment) 2 deck, set our bags  just feet away from the missiles and no-one had stopped us. Keep in mind, this was our first time on  the boat. No-one in the crew knew who we were but they still didn't stop us. I done the same thing  every morning, for the next four days. I went through into the Red Area without my ID being  checked for facial resemblance, through into the Green Area in a cluster of people, then walked  straight down to MC 2 deck and sat my unchecked bag beside the missile. I done it for almost a  week before we a QM stopped me to see if I was on the access list. He told me that I should be  handing my ID into the QMs box so they know who's on board if there's an emergency. One QM for  one night done his job, all the whole time I was there. Accessing a boat which isn't in the ship lift is  just as easy. People very rarely get stopped by the QMs unless they're in groups or look like their  lost. </p>
<p>You can carry anything through the security check points without it being checked! When I helped  with storing ship; I brought things of all shapes through and none of it was checked. Before sailing I  brought my own stuff onboard in a huge grip bad; it wasn't checked. There were 31 BSQ's + ships  staff + civilians = over 180 people bringing huge unchecked bags onboard. </p>
<p>If you've been through airport security after 9/11 you'll have seen how thorough the security is  nowadays. If airport security and Nuclear weapon security were both compared to prisons, the  airport would be Alcatraz and Base security would be house arrest. </p>
<p>Jumping back to my first time down the boat (SMQ Dry). I was far from impressed with the  security and I was about to be extremely disappointed in the conditions of the equipment. We went  to the control room; the instructor said don't touch anything. A crew member responded by saying  “it doesn't matter none of it works anyway, you can touch what you want.”  Everyone laughed. They  also complained in the Missile Control Centre (MCC) about how their equipment is “F**KED!”.   There were a lot of red tags on equipment in most of the compartments we went into. I highly  suspected a lot of them were for defect rectification, rather than standard maintenance Tagouts.  Seeing the condition of the security and equipment made me more than concerned, for the safety of  the people. It was at that point I realised I needed to gather as much safety and security information  as I could. My intentions at that point were to make the changes by reporting through the chain of  command. </p>
<p>In SMQ dry I learnt that HMS Vanguard is in the worst of the worst condition. Countless times it  tried to sail but had to come back in; forcing the other boats to do extended patrols. In one of the  lessons the instructor mentioned they found a problem with one of the nuclear reactors on one of the  boats. He said all boats might need to get their reactors replaced. The instructor didn't give away  much information. I knew I had to get assigned to a boat and go on patrol as soon as possible in  order to gather this information. Fast Track to a Leading Engineer was the answer. If I got fast  tracked I would be on the first available boat after training. I worked hard day and night, and at the  end of the 10 week course I had the achieved the highest test result on average out of a 20plus  people on the SMQ course.  At the end of SMQ dry training No-one received fast track. However  the achievement went onto my JPA record. There was just one course left, one last shot.. The   Trident Training Facility (TTF).  At the end the course I was told I had more SWS (Strategic  Weapons System) knowledge than most of the supervisors onboard. It was a nice compliment but I  doubt it. I was awarded Fast Track to Leading  Engineering Technician and received an award for  best student. </p>
<p>Just weeks after passing out of training I had a draft for HMS Victorious. My work mates started  calling me a terrorist robot because I remembered everything and I have a Northern Ireland accent.    This reputation would have undoubtedly made it difficult for me to gather information. I needed to  create distance between them, and create a  new persona; I aimed for mixture of dumbness and  eagerness to learn for simple curios reasons. Within days of being on patrol I was no longer the  terrorist robot, soaking up all the information for terrorist reasons. Playing dumb came easy for me,  I've been doing it and been it most of life.  It makes people open up and explain a lot more. If  someone assumes you know something they might leave that part out of the conversation, meaning  you've just lost information which might have been valuable. It also helps with getting out of certain  situations. I watched a lot of Columbo when I was a kid. </p>
<p>Stores Ship – The crew was getting ready to sail; I was assisting with storing the supplies on the  boat. This day gave a good indication as to how the patrol was going to be; disorganised and a risk  to health. Nobody took charge of storing ship. Most of the crew that was supposed to be helping us  left early, there was food on the ground, food thrown in skip/bin, with wrappers busted and  people  throwing food at personnel on the casing and a lot of food to still waiting to get brought onboard.  We had started in the morning and it wasn't until the night that the PO came out to take charge. He  ordered us to bring onboard the meat which was laying on the floor and in the bin for a good part of  the day. There was meat which had dirt on it because the wrapper was busted; it was still brought  onboard for us to eat on patrol. The firefighting equipment was brought on broad at the last minute  and stowed away in a rush by BSQs (non-submarine qualified personnel); most of them didn't know  where to put the gear. If the suits were stored incorrectly it could dramatically affect the response  time to an incident. I also don't like the idea of removing a lot of the firefighting equipment from  the submarine whilst in harbour. Their reasoning is, it's for re-entering the submarine from the  casing if there's a fire. How about having sets onboard and sets at the fire dump for re-entry, so the  other PPI Gold teams have the option of getting dressed anywhere onboard or from the casing. I  said that to a PO and his response was “it's a good point, they probably don't do it for money  reasons.” Considering the Billions that's poured  into these submarines, I doubt and hope it's not for  money reasons.     </p>
<p>Day one of patrol - It was a dark, rainy and windy morning I made it through the Gate to the Red  Area with my helmet on and looking down so the guard couldn't see my face; he never asked me to  look up. I  made it through the Green Area checkpoint by keeping my face away from the guards, I  didn't show my ID, and I never handed any ID in. I got buzzed straight through with the others. A  roll call was done for the BSQ's (Basic Submarine Qualification). It  turns out there were too many  people onboard and a bunch  of people weren't actually supposed to be there. A few of them got  asked to leave but they still kept too many. Which meant there would always be two people sharing  one bed (Hot Bunking) because they didn't have the space. They also set up new beds, one of which  blocked a major hydraulic isolation and  another two blocked the Port &#038; Starboard DC switch  boards. Three things that we need to gain access to in an emergency. The risk was recognised  after  about a week , and two the beds at the switchboards were taken down. There were 31 BSQs on the  boat.  31 extra people to get in the way of the damage control teams in an emergency. 31 people to  distract watch keepers with their task books. </p>
<p>Initial dive – On the first dive there was loud continuous bang being heard by everyone. It was   down the forward starboard side. The next day in the junior rates mess, I heard people complaining  amongst themselves about it being ignored.  After all patrol objective No.1 is to remain undetected  except by forces allocated in direct support. They suspected it might have been the fore-planes. The  fore-planes is a control surface that is used to alter the depth of the submarine. There were jokes  about the fore-planes being defective throughout the entire submarine. They joked about getting  them stuck in dive mode.  The aft-planes on full rise would compensate, if that did happen.  However would you feel safe having a plane fly over our cities that had a problem with getting  stuck in dive mode?   When the boat was on index they shut off from diving and stayed on the  surface for safety concerns due to the fore-planes. We need to dive whilst on patrol to remain  undetected; the safety concerns were as always, dismissed. We are down to two boats that are  available for patrol. Both of which have major defects. Question is what does it take for us to stop  the Continuous At Sea Deterrent CASD?  CASD forces there to be one submarine at sea on patrol  all time. </p>
<p>A problem occurred with the Main Hydraulic Plant. I stood at the laundry where the mechanical  engineers (ME's) hangout; to gather information. Somehow sea water was getting into it. The  amount of actual hydraulic oil in the plant had fallen to 35%  the rest was sea water. An  ET ME SM  called the officers plans to deal with the situation “stupid”. Weeks had past and the problem was  still there. I then heard a Leading ME say there's an estimated 4-5 hundred Litres of sea water in the  main hydraulic rep tank. The problem was there until the end of the patrol. Hydraulics is used to  open the muzzle hatches. This defect stopped them from doing a Battle Readiness Test (BRT) which  proves that the muzzle hatches could have opened whilst on patrol, and that if we needed to we  could've launched. </p>
<p>Throughout the patrol there were constant problems with both distillers. One distiller didn't work at  all; the other one would produce half of the recommended output until it would also stop working,  at random times. The distillers are used to turn sea water into freshwater. You would expect one of  the “most advanced submarines on the planet” to be able to provide fresh water. </p>
<p>I could sometimes here alarms on the missiles Control and Monitoring Position (CAMP) while  lying in bed. I later found out that I would've been hearing them more frequently if they didn't mute  the console; just to avoid listening to the alarms. This is the position that monitors the condition of  the missiles, and they muted the alarms.  One of the watch keepers told me and laughed about how  they would deal with any issues; they would deviate from set procedures because the procedures  can be “long and winding.” He said “sometimes you just know that you can adjust a valve slightly  and that would solve the problem.  Following the procedures might take you down a long and  winding path.” You might think that's no big deal, just an engineer using his engineering skills; if he  was caught doing this kind of action on an American submarine it would cost him his job and  possibly his freedom. If you work on the Strategic Weapon System you must follow the procedures,  mistakes can be catastrophic. </p>
<p>CAMP for obvious reasons is a position that requires constant manning. This is another rule that  isn't followed. This time it's not always the CAMP watch keepers fault. During the captains rounds  period for example, they're forced to clean a massive compartment. This draws them away from the  monitoring screen and if the alarms have been muted … Most of the time they sit talking in a tea  area; the screens aren't visible from this position. Sometimes the MC patrol and CAMP watch  keeper completely disregard the rule of constant manning. I was in the Missile Control Centre when  I heard a pipe saying “could the CAMP watch keeper please report to CAMP.” They got caught out  that time.   </p>
<p>There were 31 BSQs (Unqualified submariners)  running around and distracting people that are in  these crucial monitoring positions such as the nuclear reactors Main Control Desk (MCD),  the   nuclear missiles Control and  Monitoring Position (CAMP), the control room Panel etc. These are  positions which require permanent manning and permanent attention. However those rules aren't  followed. When I was doing my BSQ I could see the lack of attention they were paying. It was only  a matter of time before a mistake was made, and of course a mistake was made. </p>
<p>A mistake was made on the Panel in the control room. A small mistake from this position can cause  a disaster. The fixed firefighting system Weapon Stowage Compartment (WSC) fog spray was  accidentally activated by the control room panel operator. None of the electrical isolations that are  required to be made were made; creating a high risk of fire in a compartment which contains  torpedoes.  It sprayed seawater over everything in the compartment; torpedoes, lights, torpedo  monitoring panel; everything. I was called down to help with the clean up by the coxswain; the  place was flooded. Lucky there was no fire, this time. The coxswain exclaimed “I wonder why  anyone wants to work here, everything is dangerous; one little thing and we're all f**ked!”  He also  expressed concern about water spraying on electrics. Someone then said “lucky it's your last patrol  then.” We all laughed. The general consensus is there's no set person for senior survivor. However  the coxswain in an emergency sub sunk situation is the expert in escape, and I've read  documentation that says he is the senior survivor. Hearing those words come from his mouth means  a lot. As far as I know the control room panel operator got away with it. People were saying things  like “we all make mistakes” and “he's completely shaken up about it”. It confuses me how someone  could make an almost disastrous mistake and get away with it that easily. Anyone who turns up late  for a shift gets a MAA and a day’s wages deducted. Almost kill everyone and its aww poor guy he's  shaken up.   </p>
<p>That wasn't the only mistake made by the control room panel operator during my patrol. The panel  also accidentally  shutdown the hydraulic pumps. Momentarily we lost all main hydraulics before  the emergency pump kicked in. There may have been all incidents that I didn't hear about. All it  takes is for them press one wrong button in that position to cause a disaster. </p>
<p>A Fire Control Supervisor seen my interest in submarine disasters, so he gave me a book that  contained detailed information about Submarine accidents.  A lot of submarines have been lost due  to simple accidents. If one simple mistake is made it can be all other. You can find some of the  information online but most of it is covered up. It's only a matter of time before one of the Trident  submarines are lost. HMS Vanguard a Trident submarine makes an appearance in the book for the  deep depth incident. The submarine exceeded 300 meters (safe depth is 65meters). They under  estimated the weight of the submarine and didn't have enough speed for the Aft-planes to create  raise. The further the submarine descended the more the weight of the submarine increased due to  pressure. The rate of weight increase was greater than the rate that they were pumping out water.  The submarine was extremely close to being lost. </p>
<p>There was another incident on HMS Vanguard that did not appear in this book. Possibly due to the  date of the book or the fact the tried to cover it up, but everyone who serves on the Trident  submarines knows that it was HMS Vanguard that crashed into the French submarine. I was talking  to a Chief who was on the submarine at the time. He said they told him if he told anybody about it  he'd faced a prison sentence. However there was an atmosphere in the room were people felt like  telling their stories of near misses, plus he knew that we knew it was HMS Vanguard. He said “We  thought, this it we're all going to die. I was laughing my ass at the time; I think it must have been  the nerves.” He went on to explain what happened. The French submarine had took a massive  chunk out of the front of HMS Vanguard and grazed down the side of the boat. The High Pressured  Air (HPA) bottle groups were hanging off and banging against the pressure hull. They had to return  to base port slowly, because if one of HPA bottle groups exploded it would've created a chain  reaction and sent the submarine plummeting to the bottom. Luckily the boat made it back safely for  repair. There was a massive cover up of the incident. For the first time the no personal electronic   devices with a camera rule was enforced. </p>
<p>The HMS Vanguard crash didn't appear in that submarine disaster book but there's a book it will be  in. I was talking to a SWS Navigation supervisor. He told that HMS Vanguard has had so many  crazy incidents that they've got their own book filled with them. He said he's read it himself, and  some of the of things that's happened on that boat are insane. A lot of people think the boat is cursed  and try to avoid being drafted to it, but  maybe it's blessed,  after all It has survived all of these  incidents and yet somehow it's still classed as operational. It won't be long now before HMS  Vanguard makes its way to America.    </p>
<p>In another conversation with the SWS Navigation Supervisor, I got him to tell me about his  experiences onboard.  He has experienced 4 floods and fires onboard. He told me the worst was a  flood in the DC equipment space. The whole back section was submerged in electrified water, from  the 10 kW motor generators. He said they were lucky they didn't follow the normal emergency  operating procedure for that incident. Due to where the flood was coming from if they had followed  the normal procedure the submarine would've been lost. He also explained in detail the time he was  the attack BA for a fire back aft. When he got back Aft he couldn't see a thing yet the fire was just a  small one that was out before he got there. He explained how the new safety culture has created a  relaxation of heaves; we no longer have heaves/drills with a blind folded EBS. This means most  people aren't prepared to be blinded by smoke, which is what happens in a real incident on a  submarine.   </p>
<p>Fire in the Missile compartment, in harbour – One morning I standing in the Missile Control Centre  waiting for a heave/drill. The fire control chief started to tell everyone about the time they had a  scheduled heave for 10am and a real incident happened before the safeguard rule pipe was made  (SGRIF). After the safeguard rule is enforced the pipe's for fires etc, so they don't have to say “for  exercise”; it injects realism. The pipe for the fire on Missile Compartment 4 Deck was made.  Everyone was waiting on the safeguard rule so they assumed the person making the pipe had  forgotten to make the safeguard pipe first. They thought it was an exercise and he laughed at how  they were “tabs out” and in no real concern. He said once they arrived there they shit themselves. 4  deck was filled with smoke. There were reports of smoke on 1 deck before it reached 2 deck and 3  deck because the smoke was so thick it had created a smoke cloud that travelled up sides then down  through those decks. The chief said if it had been at sea there would've been about 50 dead bodies  on 3 deck because of the amount of people struggling to find an EBS coupling in order to breath.   There were then jokes about how people struggle and fight to find an EBS coupling during a  heave/drill let alone a disaster with no ability to see. Plus take into account there were 31 BSQ's on  this patrol, getting in the way. Some of the BSQs would've been useful but most of the BSQs have  never experienced it before and undoubtedly would have gotten in the way.  They would've been  using EBS couplings and blocking the path of experienced personnel; this happened a lot during  heaves/drills. The chief said they used all the SFU 90 fire extinguishers that could reach the fire,  and they were running out a portable extinguishers. The fire control junior rate said “did you not  consider using N2 drench?”  The chief replied “we were less than minutes away from N2 drenching  the compartment.” He said they finally got the fire out after using almost every portable  extinguisher onboard. </p>
<p>The fire was caused by the ships toilet roll being stacked from deck to deck-head  they whole way  along 4 deck (right beside the missiles and firing units). They reckon it was the heat from the cables  that caused the fire. Now a days due to environmental concerns we don't ditch gash/rubbish at sea.  In numerous compartments on the boat you'll find plastic bags filled with rubbish sitting on top,  underneath and beside electrical cables and equipment that generates heat.  I made my concerns  clear to a leading hand, a chief and a warrant officer. I said “There's Plastic bags filled with  cardboard touching cables and equipment that generate heat.” I reminded them of the time the toilet   rolls went on fire. The first responded by agreeing then laughing because I said plastic and  cardboard are both great materials for starting a fire. The second agreed but said there's nothing we  can do about. The third one agreed but then explained the operational advantage of not ditching  rubbish; the enemy might find our rubbish on the seabed. Well.. It's not funny, I can at least try to do  something about it, and I think a fire on a nuclear submarine is a bigger threat to the safety of the  people, than some Russian boat detecting our rubbish. It's only a matter of time before they cause a  fire. Most people that I talked to who were leading hand and above had experienced a fire of some  kind on board. The Warrant Officer had experienced multiple fires. A few times he mentioned how  the belts in the fan room are just waiting for a fire. He said we'll all shit ourselves when the  submarine fills with smoke in a matter of seconds. He's probably the hardest working most switched  on guy I've ever meet, but even he can't  stop the inevitability of a fire. </p>
<p>CB8890 (0214) - If the HE charge is exposed to excessive heat without burning, it may become  more sensitive and could cook to (non-nuclear) detonation, releasing radioactive materials and  aerosols over a wide area. </p>
<p>(0219) - The chief potential hazard associated with a live missile is the accidental ignition of the  first, second or third stage rocket motor propellant. If this were to happen in the missile tube with  the muzzle hatch shut and locked., the pressure hull and bulkheads of the MC would burst within a  matter of seconds. In addition the missile contains a number of subsidiary propulsive and ordnance  items that could cause damage to the missile and/or release toxic gases into the MC if initiated  prematurely. In some cases, this could also result in ignition or detonation of one of the rocket  motors. </p>
<p>There was a leak coming through the roof in the junior rates mess beside electrics. I asked them  “are you going to isolate it?” They replied “It's happened before, we didn't make any isolations last  time and there was no fire.” Even though water was travelling through the lights they didn't feel it  was necessary. It took over 8 hours to stop the leak. It then returned  on a few other occasions. </p>
<p>In the riders mess there was an extension cable attached to an extension cable, with clothes touching  them and sometimes wet towels were hung above them. Anyone who has passed out of nursery can  spot that hazard straight away. All personal electronic devices needed to be PAT Tested to see if it  was safe for use. This rule was never properly enforced. There was only one guy onboard who PAT  Tested the equipment. Two people in my mess got caught on week 7. I personally never got mine  PAT Tested so I could see how sloppy their enforcement was. I never got caught the whole patrol,  even though I'd sit in the JRs mess with an unmarked plug on display for all of them to see. </p>
<p>CAMP isn't the only place where alarms are ignored. In the Missile Control Centre there is a CAMP  Fault alarm that appears quite frequently. Due to it appearing frequently if the alarm is sounded  most of the time people won't even bother looking at the screen because they assume it's that same  fault. I heard there was a problem with the Starboard TG. I then found a letter in the bin telling the  Aft engineers “Starboard TG combined emergency trip stop valve. Don't follow standard operating  procedures (SOPs). Open it a little instead of fully so that indications are correct on the Propulsion  Service Panel (PSP).”  Basically they avoided the standard operating procedures so they didn't have  any alarms on their panel. There was a problem with one of the TGs. We only have two TGs  onboard. We need them to generate electricity from the reactor. If we lost both TGs we would've  been down to using the battery. Problem with that is there was also a problem with one of the  MGs  (motor generators). One MG was dysfunctional. They had problems with it before and when it went  faulty instead getting a new one, they “fixed it” and sent the same one back. Which obviously hasn't  been fixed properly. There was a lot of problems of the electrical generation equipment. Losing  power could result in losing the submarine. </p>
<p>E. Electronic equipment in the MC other than that required for safety and security must not      be operating.   A good communication system is said to be the most important thing onboard. Yet we have an old  speaker system that no one understands most of the time. Take into consideration that during most  emergences they talk through a breathing mask and you have a disaster waiting to happen.   </p>
<p>If you've never seen a missile compartment before you probably have a picture of a  glistening high  tech piece of equipment in your head. Before Captains rounds or a VIP visit it is pretty glistening  but during most of the patrol it's far from it. Missile Compartment 4 deck turns into a gym. There  are people sweating their asses of between the missiles, people rowing between a blanket of s**t  because the sewage system is defective, sometimes the s**t sprays onto the fwd starboard missile  tubes and there's also a lot of rubbish stored near the missile tubes. Not an image you would expect  of the “most advanced weapon system on the planet”. </p>
<p>There were a few incidents of people in the gym dropping weights near the nuclear weapon's firing  units. I heard one person joke about how he accidentally throw a weight and it nearly hit a missiles  firing unit. A person was caught using a Bluetooth speaker to play music on MC 4 deck.  The  captain found out and a warning issued over Full Main Broadcast (FMB) all personal electronics  would be banned if anyone else was caught using Bluetooth in the Missile Compartment. </p>
<p>This is a quote from CB8890 (0430) - With live missiles embarked, the only portable radios  authorised for use in the MC / AMS 2 are Cromwell Radios and Fire Fighter helmets with built in  communications (FFHBC). </p>
<p>Personnel Electronics should be banned yet the policy isn't enforced. You can bring whatever  electronic devices you want onboard: laptops, phones, pads etc. Almost everyone onboard sleeps on  a level of the Missile Compartment. They use their own personal electronics right beside the  missiles.   </p>
<p>Simple rules like no e-cigs and no shaving are also not obeyed. With the ventilation constantly  circulating air around the submarine it is possible for the hairs to be picked up and cause short  circuits. In the Missile Control Centre a Power Alert Alarm kept appearing and disappearing. A  possible cause is something like dust or hair creating a short. </p>
<p>I was working in the senior rates mess for a week. I heard them complain about the atmosphere not  being in spec.  For a while everyone was sleepy and then there were times people couldn't sleep.  Too high or to low O2 or CO2 levels can cause this.  Around the time of Captains rounds people  were complaining about being sleepy all the time. It could've been because of the extra work but a  lot of people were saying it was the atmosphere. Most people onboard were using a cleaning  solution which was supposed to be banned onboard. People were also mixing the cleaning agents  together to create a super cleaning agent. Someone told me they made a cocktail of cleaning  products which evaporated instantly when they added hot water. I had a headache that lasted for the  whole cleaning period; it went away shortly afterwards. We had to start cleaning again for the VIP  visit. The person I was cleaning with brought a bucket which had the banned substance in it, and  within a few minutes my headache was back. I told him it was banned but he just cracked on. The  product had a distinct smell, and it didn't take long before it was picked up. The medical assistant  walked past and recognised the smell. He said “said that smells like Terry's chocolate orange, you  know that's banned.” then walked off. Yet again the rules weren't being followed. </p>
<p>I was in the Navigation centre listening in to a conversation between the Navigation supervisor and  a Sub LT. They started talking and joking about how there's a complete lack of concern for Top   Secret information. They shared their experiences; the Sub Lt talked about someone she knew  who'd just leave Top Secret information laying on his bed for anyone to see. When the guys in the  Navigation centre got used to seeing me, they let me see Top Secret information such as:  PBNZs  and the current location. There were also times were the Navigation supervisor and the JR would  leave the compartment. One time the supervisor was of somewhere and the JR was cleaning the  outside the compartment; I was only in the compartment for about 5 minutes with the PBNZ folder  and Top Secret laptop nearby. It would've been easy for me to gather the PBNZ information. To the  right buyer this information would sell for millions. However I wasn't interested in it. Releasing that  information would show the positions the submarine would travel to on patrol. Any enemy could  use it to help them find the submarine. It is possible for a foreign enemy to eliminate one of our  submarines and get away with it. The information I have released in this document has been  carefully selected.  I would never release information that I haven't considered the implications of.  An idiot may say that releasing information about how open to attack we are will invite terrorism  and create an increased risk to security. The truth is the threat already exists. I can sit on my ass  hoping they don't find out about how ridiculous the security is or I can let our Government and  people know so they can make a change. I tried to make the changes from within. I expressed my  concerns too many times without any action being taking. </p>
<p>The reason the Navigation supervisor let me see the information was they knew there was a chance  that I would come back as a Navigation supervisor on my next patrol. However I don't have that  level of security clearance yet. There was another incident more disturbing. I was with seven other  new SWS personnel on that patrol. None of us have DV security clearance, none of us had our bags  checked, all us got to see inside the missile and a few of us got to climb inside a nuclear missile  which could have had up to 12 nuclear warheads on it. At the end of patrol we remove the missile  inverters. In order to get parts of our task books signed of we had to witness the removal. After the  removal was complete I was asked “do you want to have a look inside?” I climbed the ladder, put  half my body inside the missile and had a look around. They pointed out explosives and said “when  you’re doing this procedure don't touch them.” If any of us were terrorist we would've been given  the perfect opportunity to send nuclear warheads crashing down on the UK. A Vanguard class  submarine can carry up 12 warheads on each missile and has 16 missile tubes which means there  could be up to 192 nuclear warheads on a single boat at one time. Due to Nuclear agreements the  number would most likely be around 48 nuclear warheads; still enough to poison our atmosphere. </p>
<p>CB8890 (0215) - If RB containment is breached, several radioactive and/or toxic materials may be  exposed to the atmosphere. These include plutonium, uranium, lithium compounds, tritium gas and  beryllium. If mixed with water, fumes or toxic gases will be generated. When installed in a Trident  II D5 missile, RBs clustered around the Third Stage Rocket Motor are at risk from a rocket motor  propellant fire. </p>
<p>(0216) - The RB could become physically damaged due to collision or fire in peacetime and in war  could be subjected to splinter attack or the effects of detonation from enemy projectiles. This type  of damage could also result from a successful terrorist attack. </p>
<p>(0217) - An accident or enemy action may cause rupture of the RB, burning or possible detonation  of the HE and release of radioactive contamination.   </p>
<p>The port team removing the inverters from inside the missile, had removed them at almost twice the  speed of the starboard team. When the port team started to work on the starboard missiles, the  starboard team called them cowboys, they laughed about how much of a rushed job they done. I  didn't get to observe how the port team removed them so fast, but I did get to observe the starboard  team for two missiles. Even the starboard team wasn't following the correct procedures. Normal  reader worker routine was completely ignored; the worker carried out the operation from memory   instead of doing it by the book. They also joked about how the Americans do it. They said the  Americans lay on top of each other and if one hand goes out of site from the other person there will  be a lot of shouting their head off. I think that's better than letting a bunch of non-security cleared  people climb inside for nosey. </p>
<p>luckily none of us were terrorists. However the rate at which people are getting pushed through the  system because of man power shortages is scary. SWS is so short on man power it's unbelievable  and people are getting pushed through at an alarming rate. There are leading hands doing the jobs  chiefs used to do. There is a SWS leading hand who still hasn't got his DV clearance and he's in the  position of a launcher supervisor. If I ignored the threat and stuck with my job I'd be on course to be  a leader in the SWS department with a matter of months. 30% of my entire SWS task book got  signed of inside 10 minutes without me talking over or performing any of it. This is a task book that  has a limit of 18months, 12 months for fast track. A guy that was in my squad completed his task  book alongside in less than three months. He is now fully qualified to watch-keeper who may have  to carry out emergency operating procedures in the MCC as a fire-control JR even though he has  never been on a patrol, and hasn't even completed BSS or BSQ. BSS being the complete basic  understanding of the boat. It's just a matter of time before we're infiltrated by a psychopath or a  terrorist; with this amount of people getting pushed through. </p>
<p>Some of the personalities onboard are already alarming. Probably the most worrying is the SWS  Junior Rate whose hobby is killing small animals. He also expressed his interest in watching dark  porn, like crush porn. Which is basically women stomping kittens to death while a guy masturbates.  I have no idea how that guy isn't mentally discharged. </p>
<p>There's other people onboard that should be raising suspicion in people's minds, especially after that  guy went on a shooting rampage on the A-Boat. One guy specifically. I don't want to name any  names in this report, so for now I'll just refer to him as pole.  During the morning of captains rounds  pole physically attacked someone because they started cleaning too early. It happened in front of my  bunk. The poor guy was verbally assaulted by pole, and when he asked pole “Who do you think  you're talking too?” Pole jumped out of his bed and attacked the guy.  After the fight pole threatened  to kill the guy. I witness Pole get aggressive with five different people; he threatened to kill two of  them. I was one of the people, but he never lived up to his promises of attacking me. </p>
<p>Pole also snapped at a leading hand on the last day of patrol. Pole was promised early departure on  the first boat transfer because of his situation at home, but command decided his situation at home  wasn't as demanding of early release as some of the other guys in the crew. Pole took a position in  the queue for food ahead of the personnel who were next on watch. A SWS leading hand said to him   “you're not even next on, get behind me.” Pole snapped at a leading hand in the dinner line, he  called him a “F**KING C**T”, then stood behind him like a demented pit bull ready to attack. The  leading hand said “what's your problem? Get to the f**king back, now!” but Pole didn't move until  one of the JRs escorted him to the back.  After my breakfast I went up to see what the leading hands  response would be. With my usual dumb curious look I asked him “What happened in the dinner  line”. He responded “He tried to get in front of me, even though he's not even next on watch”. I said  “He shouted at you, didn't he?” His reaction was “he's just on edge because he never got the boat  transfer”. That was that. If threatening everyone, attacking someone and calling a leader a  F**KING C**T whilst looking at them like your about to kill him, doesn't make you a suspected as  a threat to other personnel then I really don't know what does. </p>
<p>It appeared most people had breaking points at some point on patrol. There was one guy who  presented a prime example of how someone could go from saying things like “back to back patrols  won't bother me” and “patrols aren't that bad.”  Till completely losing it over a missed placed pair  of flip flops. This guy smoked electric cigarettes which are banned onboard. His supply ran low and   that's when he became aggressive. After losing his flip flops he went berserk, he was throwing  things everywhere, looking for them. He shouted “everyone on this boat is a bunch of f**king  re***ds.” he punched lockers and went on shouting and banging for over ten minutes. Not once did  the CAMP watch keeper come over to see what the banging on his compartment was. When  someone trying to sleep said “what's your problem?” he responded by verbally assaulting him. He  told him “get back in your f**king bed now you...” If this is how people react to a lost flip flop after  a tiny adjustment to their nicotine intake, then what else are people capable of doing once the  electric cigarette ban is properly enforced? If the Captain was to catch anyone with electrical  cigarettes he would have most likely enforced the ban. </p>
<p>I heard the Launcher and Fire-control Supervisors whispering to each other in the MCC. The Fire- control supervisor spilled coffee on the missiles Data entry subsystem keyboard. It set of an alarm.  That's all the information I gathered on that incident because they were trying to cover it up so the  Weapons Engineering Officer (WEO) wouldn't find out what happened. </p>
<p>One of the BSQ's told me he was contemplating leaving after his first patrol. He went to see the  coxswain; the coxswain took him into his office. The coxswain recommended he should leave; he  said “it doesn't get any better. You might as well leave now before you waste your life here.”     A hydraulic leak was found on a missile's valve.   </p>
<p>During a battery clean the BSQ's were sent down to help out. Afterwards one of them was  complaining about how his fingers went numb, but little sympathy was felt by everyone because he  nearly blinded someone by throwing a rag at his face. The rag just missed his eye, but that was  enough to irritate it enough for him to require medical assistance from the doctor. This incident  highlights the lack of concern for safety. There was no safety brief, the appropriate PPE wasn't worn  and a careless action was performed. </p>
<p>When to raise a nuclear weapons safety for a radiation alarm – The SWS Navigation Supervisor  role during a missile radiation alarm is, Command Advisor. In order to learn what I need to as  Command Advisor the Navigation Supervisor asked me to watch him during a heave/drill. One  thing I picked up on was people I different ideas of when the nuclear weapon safety alert should be  raised. Most people think you alert inboard straight away; whilst some people think you don't alert  inboard until the radiation alarm has been confirmed as an actual leak and not a faulty alarm. </p>
<p>On my BSQ board I was asked “what would you do if The Sun or someone like that got your  number, and asked about the problems with the reactors or humidity, stuff like that.”  I told them “I  would just hang up.” The reactor situation is something I've been trying to gather information on for  over a year now, but nobody wants to talk about it. If I pushed too hard for information people  would've become very suspicious; which they probably already were since they asked me that  question on a BSQ board. I felt I couldn't say “So what's the problem with the reactors then?”  I did  ask them about the humidity problem though, because I had seen how bad it was.  Forward dome  and 1 deck WT flat were the worst; there was water dripping from the roof onto all sorts of  electrics. They told me that there's a problem with the system and the condensation levels are 15%  higher than they should be at.  I then told them “There's a pump in AMS1 that sprays water on an  electrical distribution box.” One of them said “that's a bit of a design flaw.” They laughed and  changed the subject.   </p>
<p>At one point on my board I was told the best way to take down a submarine. He said “nobody ever  things of it, but if they targeted that it would take out the whole submarine.” I'm not going say how  on here, that's information nobody should talk about. A lot of people have had conversations with  me about how easy it would be to take down the submarine. It's disturbing to know that the people   serving on these boats are aware of many ways to destroy them from within. One of the biggest  threats we face is suicidal attack from within. There have been suicides onboard, and on an A-boat  we had a shooter kill his own work colleagues. There were some people that I served with on that  patrol, who showed clear psychopathic tendencies. The odds favour destruction, if no action is  taking. </p>
<p>N2 bottle group pressures dropped below 3625 psi, the stated required minimum. N2 drench is used  to extinguish fires in the missile tube or in a compartment: </p>
<p>CB8890 (0438) - In the event of a fire within the MC or AMS 2 that cannot be brought under  control by conventional firefighting methods, the MC/AMS2 can be nitrogen drenched using the  procedures contained in DC documentation. </p>
<p>(0441) - Nitrogen bottle group pressures must be maintained above a minimum of 3625 psi in order  to safeguard the nitrogen drench facility. </p>
<p>The reaction to the N2 drench falling below these levels was, there's nothing we can do whilst we're  the on patrol SSBN. The cause of the leakage was still unknown when we got back from patrol. The  last time I seen the pressure it was over 100 psi below the ordered minimum. I listened in to a  conversation between the port and starboard crew CAMP watch keepers. The Starboard crew Camp  watch keeper said “We had a problem with ours on Vanguard, and they found a massive hole on the  back of one of the Missile Gas reducing stations.”   </p>
<p>I went to Camp to learn about their EOP (Emergency Operating Procedure) actions for a missile  emergency. Two Camp watch keepers and a MC patrol were in the tea area, near CAMP.  They  wanted to know what I knew about their EOPs for a missile emergency. I told them what the book  says they do. They disagreed with me; they were all convinced that it doesn't say in the (EOP)  book   for  a missile emergency in harbour,  they need to check the Tam 73 fixed radiation monitor. One of  them said “I bet it doesn't say that, we never do that.”  I said “Okay £20 it says that.” I could see in  his eyes he started to worry that he might be wrong, but that didn't last for long and he accepted the  bet. I got the book out, and proved them wrong. Maybe they don't check it but this was about what  their EOP book says they do for a missile emergency. This is a book they should know word for  word. Their list of actions isn't even that long. It was shocking how none of them new what the  book said. </p>
<p>There were 2 prank 999 phone calls whilst on patrol. A 999 phone call sets of an alarm in the  control and the whole boat has to carry out phase 1 damage control checks. </p>
<p>A CB8890 exam was coming up; to test people’s knowledge on the safety and security of SWS. I  was asked “Have you read CB8890?” Instead of saying yes, I have read it twice and I have a copy  of it on my phone.” I said “I read through it quickly once and I skipped the annexes.” Playing dumb  worked out again. One of them began to tell me how to read the book. He said “no one fully reads  the book, they just know which parts are going to be questions, and they learn them.”  I Launcher  supervisor disagreed, he said “everyone should know that book, especially SWS.” I agree with the  Launcher supervisor; it's a book containing information about the safety and security of SWS and  we're SWS. The exam was a totally farce. They told everyone most of the answers, and any answers  people didn't know they just copied from the person beside them. I was in the MCC and I seen the  launcher supervisor ringing up people who had missed the exam. He asked them “pick a number  between 27 and 30.” The number they picked was their test result. </p>
<p>I could've got the code for the WEO's trigger safe. I was standing just a couple of metres behind   him when he opened the safe. I didn't pay attention to the combination but the point is they seem to  forget I'm not DV security cleared.   </p>
<p>After I was asked “what do you do if you find the Firing Unit or Jettison Panel key?”  They told me  the correct procedure and what they actually do. They told me about a few occasions where this has  happened. If someone gets their hand on both keys, they can jettison a missile. Jettisoning without  following the proper procedure to list the boat or turning off power to the Variable Energy Eject  Panel (VEEP) would send the missile out of the tube at full force and it will fall back down onto the  submarine. What they actually did when they found the key was they handed them back to the  person who left it laying around. The normal reporting routine was aborted. </p>
<p>There was an excessive amount of Trouble Failure Report's (TFRs) being filed in SWS department;  due to operator and defective equipment. An example of one of the operator errors: They allowed a  trainee to carry out a procedure he had never seen done before. It was a simple procedure, all he had  to do was click Yes when he was told to click Yes, but he clicked No.   </p>
<p>CB8890 (0207) -  Authorised personnel work to carefully controlled and documented working  practices. </p>
<p>There's a board with a list of SWS defects on it in the MCC. It is very close to being full. </p>
<p>When we were passing in as a fully qualified submariners they told us we couldn't drink the shot of  Rum with the dolphin metal/badge in the glass. Considering everything that was happening around  us it made me feel like Harry Houdini getting forced to wear an extra pair of socks encase his feet  get cold during a stunt. </p>
<p>The other crews WEO came on our boat after the patrol. People mocked him behind his back; they  didn't like him because he showed keenness to do his job properly. There's an attitude common to  most people onboard; they show hostility to anyone who works too hard.   </p>
<p>Final tests - At the end of a patrol tests are done to see if the weapons system could have performed  a successful launch. These tests let us know if we really were providing the UKs strategic nuclear  deterrent / CASD. It had reached the end of my three month patrol. It was time to do WP 186  missile compensation test. The test was carried out 3 times and it failed, 3 times. Basically the test  showed that the missile compensation system wouldn't have compensated for the changes in weight  of the submarine during missile launches. Which means the missiles would've been launched on an  unstable platform, if they decided to launch. Another test was the Battle Readiness Test (BRT)  which proves that the muzzle hatches could've opened whilst on patrol; if they needed to launch,  they could've launched. The BRT was cancelled due to the main hydraulic system containing mostly  sea water instead of actual hydraulic oil. Basically they're endangering the public and spending  Billions upon Billions of tax payers money for a system so broken it can't even do the tests that  prove it works.   </p>
<p>Five minutes before leaving the boat for leave I walked into the JRs toilets; the whole deck was  flooded in a couple inches of brown water. I tried the senior rates and it was the same. This summed  the system up. </p>
<p>A Back aft ME told me he was going to tell his family about everything that happens onboard. I said  “like what?” He said he was going tell them about how everything onboard is nothing like you  expect it to be, everything is broken.  He was on the exact same wave length as me. We'd both   witnessed a lot, but the amount events we didn't see is what's scary. I know most people know the  Trident programme is a disaster waiting to happen, but they never tell the public. I've heard of  people getting caught selling information and people writing stuff on Facebook, but I've never heard  of anybody trying to alert the public.   </p>
<p>A lot to lose – One of the main reasons nobody tries to talk about it is they've a lot to lose. A SWS  submariner in the Royal Navy gets paid quite a lot of money. They're handing out £50,000 bonuses,  to keep people in the job. It's a good career for education and work experience. There's been more  than a few people go into 6 figure jobs afterwards.  There's a lot of stories about people getting  caught talking about information. People have been caught and punished for putting information of  Facebook, so there is a general feeling that you wouldn't get to say much before being silenced. </p>
<p>You’re guaranteed to lose everything, if you talk. Career, money, everything you own, your  freedom, possibly your life, contact with family and friends. It's a lot to lose especially if you think  there's a good chance you won't get much information if any out before your caught, and of course  there's good chance any information you do get out will be covered up. </p>
<p>After rising from the depths I knew I had gained enough information to eliminate the biggest threat  the UK faces. I also gained the knowledge that my desire to serve the people no matter what, wasn't  some fantasy.  I have sacrificed everything: a good career, a chance to be a millionaire by selling  the information, my life savings, my freedom, quality time with family and friends, possibly my  life… The decision to release this information was the easiest yet most painful decision of life.  </p>
<p>If I die it wasn't suicide. I'm willing to sacrifice everything, but I would never use my own hand to  take my life. If I'm killed and this report is made public, there will be a high chance of a violent  revolution. I'm not seeking or promoting violence. </p>
<p>There's still a good chance of me receiving a pardon from the Prime minister. I only released  selected information, I'm not selling the information to the paper or a foreign government, I will be  handing myself in to the police and my desires to serve the people are same as the Prime Ministers  (hopefully). I also believe it's in the Prime Ministers best interest to release me. Prosecuting  someone for alerting the people and the Government to a major threat isn't a good image for any  government. </p>
<p>I'm realising this information in this way because it's the only way I can to be sure it gets out. I  raised my concerns about the safety and security of the weapon system through the chain of  command on multiple occasions. My concern couldn't have been any clearer. Multiple times I  complained to people of various ranks about being able to walk straight down to the Missile  Compartment with a bag on my back which wasn't checked. With the only security being lazy  security guards that don't check IDs properly. Another example: I mentioned to a Leading Hand, a  Chief and a Warrant officer about how storing rubbish in plastic bags next equipment and wiring  that generates heat will cause a repeat of the blazing inferno on 4 deck. I raised concerns for a lot of  things, and not once did someone even attempt to make a change. I seen two paths in front of me.  Ignore the threat or risk everything I have to inform the Government and the people. </p>
<p>I was listening in to a conversation in the senior rates mess about the VIPs we get on board at the  end of patrol. One of the Chiefs brought up the time he meet the Prime minister, David Cameron.  He was treated like every other VIP that comes onboard in the sense he was kept in the dark. Every  time a VIP comes on board the boat becomes a Ghost town, all off watch personnel are to be out of  site. No-one can say anything bad about Trident.  The focus is always maintained on why we need  Trident. </p>
<p>I strongly believe that the Prime Minister and most people that defended Trident had no idea about  how dire the situation is. This is not the time to judge on what they did when they didn't know; it's  about what they do now that they know. </p></blockquote>
<p>I know of no better proof that the "atomic weapons not actually militarily useful" than this sort of perennial wank. If you don't know that the security surrounding these allegedly essential important weapons is at best a joke and at most something outsourced to Hollywood, if you don't know about the malfunctioning latrines, the missing tools, etc etc... well, that just says something about how informed you are.</p>

						<p>Mr. Popescu: While I don't question your math with respect to uranium energy, aren't you failing to take into account that it takes relatively little fissile material in order to start a massive fusion reaction? Modern fusion warheads release 1000x the energy of their WWII predecessors. The amount of available fusible material may indeed be enough to "boil the seas".</p>

						<p>It is true that the math presented discusses an obsolete approach, and it is true that modern weapons use fusion/fission sandwiching to achieve payloads grossly speaking three degrees of magnitude larger than what's contemplated here.</p>
<p>Whether this is sufficient to boil the seas or not in anyone's view is, of course, open to that one's own arbitration. Nevertheless, in pure energetic terms, three degrees of magnitude take the energy expenditure from "one afternoon's sunshine" to "three years' worth of sunshine delivered within seconds", or roughly speaking drying off meters' worth of water. This certainly seems to qualify.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as far as the issue of costs is concerned, this modernisation also significantly increases the costs involved. Perhaps not by three degrees of magnitude, but nevertheless significantly enough. You will remember the part that says</p>
<blockquote><p>For the other thing, a single Trident missile (which is, as alf well points out, not at all the whole story) costs 30 to 40 million dollars, and delivers 15-20 TeraJoules, ideally. The delivery costs of fissile material involved in the Operation Dry Bathroom Floors would alone count for something like... 4 to 5 trillion dollars. The 2015 US budget is in total a shade under 4 trillion, so it wouldn't cover delivery. To get an idea of what this means : the US couldn't afford to pay for the taxi. Not the show, not the dinner, and definitely not the girl. Just... the taxi.</p></blockquote>
<p>Delivery will still be required, irrespective of type of payload - and the ratings of these missiles is actually based on the modern process from what I can determine, so nothing seriously changes on this score.</p>
<p>In any case, the proposition here isn't that nuclear weapons don't exist, or don't work, or can't be had or can't be made to work. The proposition is that their principal utility lies in military marketing rather than military operations, and that the general public's apparent ignorance on the topic seems to have a lot to do with the propaganda needs therein incumbent. Similarly to how ownership (or drivership) of a red Firebird doesn't make one rich, or a good sexual fit, or an apt future parent - even if teenagers seem to have thought so at some time, in some place, somewhere, in a galaxy far, far away...</p>

						<p>It's funny how the duck and cover campaigns are the subject of so much scorn. As if those guys from the 1950s were idiots. Really? Those "idiots" survived WWII, and they better understood war, bombs, and even nukes than anyone since. They knew that in the event of a nuclear attack, unless you're in the epicenter (unlikely), you aren't going to be vaporized, but neither do you want the kiddies running outside to stare at the pretty light.</p>
<p>Contrast that with the 1980s, where they were hanging up posters saying "Warning! In the event of a nuclear attack, follow these instructions: 1. Bend over. 2. Put your head between your legs. 3. Kiss your ass goodbye."</p>
<p>Proves your point, I suppose. Nukes are military marketing.</p>
<p>As are the Olympics...</p>

						<p>In the golden age of the nuclear bomb, 1950s to 1990s, the mantra went "If you own you've won, but if you use you lose." That is exactly correct, and contrary to what was alleged in the propa-press throughout and hence, nobody was going to use them in retaliation of someone else having used them first. Why waste an excellent opportunity to take wholly hallucinated "higher moral ground" and deliver to the poor sod a thorough Nazi thrashing?</p>
<p>With the gradual demise of the colonial powers, all huddled together in the tiny roost of Europe like a colony of noisy birds and the rise of the large Eurasian land powers (Russia, China, the slowly aggregating Arab panstate) the value and importance of the nuclear bomb evaporated. It seemed like a big deal in 1950, regarded through European eyes and an understanding of conflict that was strictly Continental - the same type of error that led Hitler to his failed attempt at subduing England through bombardment without actually having enough bombs, that had led Napoleon to try and dominate Russia without actually having enough soldiers and so on. It never was a big deal universally, just like Europe was never the world, just like Urbi et Orbi was a figure of speech, not a literalism.</p>

						<p>@<b>qes</b> Speaking of kiddies - the Ukr children of Chernobyl had famously bathed in the hot water (ex-coolant) leaking out of the re-configured reactor. Because hey, hot water was such a rarity in <a href=http://trilema.com/2013/the-dilemma-of-fake-money/#selection-97.1-97.39 >the Soviet Union</a> no ape could pass it by! So... yeah.</p>
<p>The Olympics were, originally, exactly created for the purpose of advertising the sort of male prowess that constructed war at the time (in the Greek period, war basically consisted of what throughout modernity has passed for a children's game - namely, form two lines, hold tight together, bash into the others' line), and through that ploy a peace mechanism, yes. It also created the fat, unfit Athens that was later easy prey for the Macedonians (under Alex's father), the Latins and generally speaking any unwashed horde worth the salt on its skin. </p>
