<p>From <a href="http://trilema.com/2020/thelastpsychiatristcom-taboos-are-the-ways-christians-try-to-control-us-adnotated">Taboos Are The Ways Christians Try To Control Us</a> : </p>
<blockquote><p>What did Epstein do wrong?  Incest and infidelity.   He did both, right?   What's happened in the press?  The incest's severity has completely erased the infidelity.  At no time does Epstein have to confront the internal guilt of infidelity, because he's battling an incest charge.  I don't mean publicly-- I mean privately, he never faces himself about infidelity, only incest.</p>
<p>Now incest-- terrible, we all agree, but should the law really be monitoring the sex lives of consenting adults?  Of course not.  "Incest is wrong," I might say, "but we have no business policing it."  What just happened there is that "Epstein" has managed to get me to partially support him.  I may hate him, but irrelevant- "he" interprets my partial support as part of a global judgment of him, and thus has mitigated his guilt by converting it to shame, and the shame is lessened because some people are partially supportive.</p>
<p>I realize that HE didn't do this on purpose or consciously (though his lawyer is), and HE does not care about my support.  But it happened nonetheless.  That's the whole point of the media's involvement, our generational solution to the problem of guilt.  This is what we will all be doing, the internet as confessional and for the remission of sins.  Whether we do it on purpose or not, once a private guilt that (should) gnaw at you gets exposed as a public shame, and the public/whatever newspaper you have at your disposal/your facebook friends/etc start taking sides, that internal guilt is obliterated.  Epstein still has to deal with the shame and social and legal repercussions, but not guilt.</p>
<p>What's the result? The result for Epstein isn't my interest, it's his life and it's not my right to keep his guilt alive for him.   But now, FOR SURE, incest is no longer a taboo, it is no longer a matter of guilt, but of shame.  Everyone is free to decide whether they can take the shame; everyone has become a Nietzschean superman, deciding for themselves if there are any taboos. Which, of course they were always free to do-- but they had the good sense not to try.  Now it is possible to ask "am I free to have consensual sex with my adult daughter?" -- which, of course, you are free to do, and which, of course, you are never free to do.  It's that simple.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, you understand, postmodernity's way of getting rid of the taboo as a mechanism and instead rely on the connected society for support is no good, because REASONS!</p>
<p>Not even a year earlier, in <a href="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2008/05/my_daughter_deserved_to_die_fo.html">"My daughter deserved to die for falling in love"</a> : </p>
<blockquote><p>Though I doubt anyone in this country would sympthize with this nut, there is a certain deference to the notion that some cultures have honor killings, as if that is sufficient explanation; as if merely abandoning that practice will solve the problem. </p>
<p>But what really is going on here?  We can try to frame it in terms more real to us: pretend this  is a Jewish family and the British soldier is a Nazi.  Let's add that the Nazis have already killed this man's brother, and raped his sister; let's say that the Nazis even did this right there in front of the 16 year old girl-- yet she still falls in love with the Nazi soldier.</p>
<p>In this context, we can better understand the anger, the betrayal, the incredulity-- "how the hell could you...!!!"  But none of this explains why he killed her.</p></blockquote>
<p>Really ? None of that explains why he killed her ? And what pray tell should he have done, defeated the taboo in the postmodern fashions of his adoptive society, and went on to complain to the newspaper ? Maybe it doesn't explain why he killed her because what he should have done is bring her on Jerry Springer ?</p>

<p>Time to look away. There's slavery here, there's education = beatings here, there's "if you've never caned your wife not only you're not a good person, but you're actually a miserable whelp whose failure to contribute to the education of society is ruining society for everyone", there's a standing moral imperative to <a href="http://trilema.com/2012/the-crime-of-being-american/">murder agents of your government</a>, let alone an absolute interdiction in paying any tax, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Aren't you glad you looked away ? Forget those "principle" things - they're for sociopaths.
