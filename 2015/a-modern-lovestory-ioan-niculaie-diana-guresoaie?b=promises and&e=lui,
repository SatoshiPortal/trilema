<p>I come from a world very different from any world you're familiar with, especially if English is your first [and only] language. Circumstances exceedingly convenient just provided me with a usable chunk of life, which allows me to produce<sup><a href="#footnote_0_64003" id="identifier_0_64003" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Term of art.">i</a></sup> for your benefit a very informative slice of my originating culture. I feel obligated, consequently, to take the time and go into detail. The result, while lengthy and involved, and while necessarily not a complete story<sup><a href="#footnote_1_64003" id="identifier_1_64003" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This means, it's not enough for you to go `I know Eastern Europe now` or pass muster to be a spy there.">ii</a></sup>, is guaranteed to go all the way to the root of the tree, which should be something.</p>
<p>Before we proceed, we must lay down some groundwork.</p>
<p><strong>Ioan Neculaie</strong> is what they call there "om de afaceri", ie "man of business". He is not, pointedly not, what you'd call a businessman. The term is used in its own context to distinguish him from the alternative, which would be "mafiot"<sup><a href="#footnote_2_64003" id="identifier_2_64003" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Also does not mean Mafioso / made man / mobster or any such. If you will, a fantastic ethymology would be to say it's created off the root that gave Mafia by adding the suffix that went from `idea` to `idiot`, ie -iot. (By the way, this is Greek in origin. Because yeah, that's what the modern Greeks did : took Ancient Greeks and made them Greekiots.) 
For a good discussion of the `mafiot` trope, see In criza de modele... ; for a good discussion of the `om de afaceri` trope, see Moartea ca o veste buna inter alia.">iii</a></sup> : they both denote elder men in a position of power, the difference being that the former is a man of the system, with no significant resources outside of it, whereas the second is a man from outside the system, and with significant resources outside of it. Otherwise, they are both expected to be well connected with a bevy of corrupt politicians.<sup><a href="#footnote_3_64003" id="identifier_3_64003" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="To vindicate any delusions of superiority you might unwarrantedly harbor : your own businessmen are converging towards this mean - Eastern Europe has merely been here for much longer than you, that's all. It's advanced down the path of progress, in point of fact, as a factual, historical matter, far further than your dreams ever went and yes, `progress` is really decay. Sorry I had to be the one to tell you.">iv</a></sup></p>
<p>This particular fellow, born in the 50s, used to own Romania's truck factory, and a football team associated with it, but he "lost" it a few years ago, and a year later was convicted (suspended sentence, of course) for doing something or the other to the land of another such businessman (Ioan Olaru). Amusingly enough, there exists an entirely identical guy whose name is Ioan Niculaie, who owns some ex-state farms with significant capacity. This last Ioan (Niculaie) is according to Forbes the third richest Romanian, with a fortune estimated at ~10% of MPEx float or thereabouts. The Ioan (Neculaie) we're discussing today is not nearly this notable, which is to say not really notable at all. </p>
<p><strong>Diana Guresoaie</strong> is a young woman, which in Romanian would traditionally be "<em>fata mare</em>", ie, "big girl". You can't call her that, however, because of the implications of virginity that traditional term carries, which would be plainly insulting to the more urbanized sort of Romania that replaced the pure agricultural society of the 1700s. She is approaching the end of her shelf life, with the horrifying status of "<em>fata batrina</em>" ie old maid looming quite threateningly. Under these circumstances she is working her ass off to make something of herself while her window lasts, for which reason she carries my unreserved respect. </p>
<p>Here she is :</p>
<p><a href="http://trilema.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/diana-guresoaie.jpg"><img src="http://trilema.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/diana-guresoaie.jpg" alt="diana-guresoaie" title="diana-guresoaie" width="320" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-64008" /></a></p>
<p>And to put that visual into perspective, here's a title culled from the Romanian version of fashion/scandal rags<sup><a href="#footnote_4_64003" id="identifier_4_64003" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The difference between Romanian magazines and what you'd expect is amply discussed in Trilema, because it is such fertile ground for so very much derision. Some choice titles : Operiatiunea dulapul ; Power Fashion - editorii care au revolutionat moda ; Jurnalist = labagiu. [DOVEZI] ; Preocupari sanatoase in presa ; Momentul delicate ; Tabu si contextul de aur ; Indescriptibila Academie Catafailencu ; Continut sexi pornografic, nu intrati!">v</a></sup> :</p>
<blockquote><p>"Stramba" lui "Dodel" a pozat aproape goala pentru Showbiz.ro. In plus, "a doua bomba sexy" a lui Cristi Tanase a dat detalii picante despre fosta lor relatie.</p></blockquote>
<p>The title says that Dodel's Hunchback posed almost naked for showbiz.ro + the Cristi Tanase's Second Sexy Bomb told all about their ex relationship. The actual article shows the woman atop a chair in lingerie, which... you know, "almost naked". The interesting part is however the nominative formation. So, the woman is X's Y. Traditional Romanian names worked exactly like this, famous pre-WW1 novelist Ion Creanga's name was, as far as anyone who knew him was concernerned, Nic'a lu' Åžtefan a Petrii, which is to say, "the Ioan of the Stephen of Petra", ie, that Ioan who is owned by a Stephen [his father] who is owned by Petra [the wife].<sup><a href="#footnote_5_64003" id="identifier_5_64003" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Before you read too much into it - there were many schemes in actual usage during the oh, 2-3000 years of settled, contiguous, latin-speaking inhabituation of the present lands of Romania. What this particular scheme denotes is probably that Ioan came to settle in the village where Petra had been born, rather than the other way around, so the possessive line simply traces the WoT relationship : owned by his father whom we know from the mother.">vi</a></sup> Obviously modernity puts some pressure on this system, but it adapts, structure intact. So what if men don't keep one wife<sup><a href="#footnote_6_64003" id="identifier_6_64003" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="For fear of public opinion ie, `gura satului` as well as out of sheer necessity given scarce resources at the time.">vii</a></sup> but a bunch of girlfriends ? X's Y and Z's K! </p>
<p>How would you like living like this ? By the time you're done with highschool your name wouldn't be Jane Doe anymore, as much as Mike's Bitch, Joe's Swampthing, Rakim's Hotbunzz and Adrian's Hellraiser. Yes, those would be your names. What is this "one name" thing ? And if you were even marginally sexually active, it'd take longer to write down all your various names than it'd take to eat a meal! Then comes college...</p>
<p>Fun, huh! Now hurry up and get married before you're actually worthless - you don't live in America where the government prints money to keep you fed. No, none of that, you live in reality, a reality where $100 a month is good money you might not be able to get, especially not once you're out of your 20s. Get crackin'.</p>
<p><strong>Romanian Secret Services</strong> are an establishment of humor maintained on public funds, whose principal if not outright only activity is to wiretap everyone's phones, go through the mess and feed the choicest bits to the press. This is seriously discussed in the Romanian language in a few articles<sup><a href="#footnote_7_64003" id="identifier_7_64003" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="See Functia asiguratorie a blogului ; see A t-spea dosariada etc.">viii</a></sup>, written by me for Trilema, and nowhere else. This has also yielded the famous <a href="http://trilema.com/2012/sorana-comedie-bufa-intr-un-act/">Sorana - comedie bufa intr-un act</a>, as far as I know the only dramatic creation in the Romanian language this millenium worth the name. It describes the adventures of a schoolgirl, her best friend, their parents, their pimp and their true loves. It's pretty good, and it certainly explains how "secret services" work in Romania and to what purpose. </p>
<p>Exactly in that same manner, they leaked some transcripts of private conversations between the two aforemnetioned, in the broader context of a large prosecution of "prostitution", which is to say young women exchanging sexual favours for food and petty cash. Seeing how this is absolutely and universally the mode of behaviour in that place since forever, well supported by a culture which to this day maintains that walking away from an erect penis is immoral for a healthy woman<sup><a href="#footnote_8_64003" id="identifier_8_64003" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="And for good reason, see Erotoghid pentru femeia adulta.">ix</a></sup>, and seeing how the only thing not participating says about you is that you're ugly and unwanted, the "prosecution" for lolz and press junkets limited itself to "famous" women, which is to say these desperate girls appearing on the (incredibly cheap) Romanian television shows for a coupla hundred euros per two hour session.<sup><a href="#footnote_9_64003" id="identifier_9_64003" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="You think I'm kidding ? I'm not kidding. That's what they get, and it's usually in cash so they don't have to report it, which already led to convictions for a number of TV producers, such as for instance Orlando Nicoara.">x</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>That should be enough to set the stage.</strong> So we have the older guy, the young woman and the whole chain of chronic masturbators with the telephoto lens trained on them. Ready ? Action!</p>
