<p><em>This is the English version of an older - and important - Romanian article : <a href="http://trilema.com/2009/cauze-si-scopuri/">Cauze si scopuri</a>.</em></p>
<ul>"You're fat."<br />
"How could you say that to me! Are you trying to make me feel bad about myself ?!"<br />
"I don't want anything, it's a factual observation."</ul>
<p>This exchange - whether imaginary or not matters little - exposes rather clearly a very significant difference. I have noticed, from my own experience, that any action results either from a certain cause, or towards some sort of purpose. These two are the two sources of any action, and there isn't a third.</p>
<p>Every time they confront a given action, people tend reflexively to seek to understand "to what purpose" it occurs. What is the hidden intent, wherefore is the agent aiming. What do you mean by this, why me, and especially "who set you up to this", like the Romanian politician would say.<sup><a href="#footnote_0_60172" id="identifier_0_60172" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Romanian public culture is rather primitive and unrefined (sort-of like the US is becoming these days). Politicians however are exactly the reptiles they're everywhere. The intersection of these results in particular fixations, such as this one.">i</a></sup></p>
<p>I however am firmly persuaded that acting towards a purpose is at the very least morally suspect (that much I can show, but I'm almost willing to say it's outright rotten) and technically inefficient. Let as look into the matter.</p>
<p>All causes being necessarily in the past, their collection is necessarily finite, and explicitly given. Acting from a cause you can of course err, either through not knowing the cause exactly in all its details, and thus acting inadequately, or through not knowing elements outside of the cause, context as it were, which one way or another fundamentally alter the response adequate to the situation. By example :</p>
<p>John gives Mary 20 dollars, because Mary lent him 20 dollars last Thursday. Inasmuch as John is not mistaken about either the cause or the context, his action is perfectly adequate. </p>
<p>If in fact it wasn't Mary, but her twin sister Mara that lent him the 20 dollars, or if the 20 dollars were not in fact being lent to John, but merely a repayment of an even older loan John had made to Mary, then the action is inadequate, through not having correctly understood the cause. The remedy is directly obvious and necessarily accessible : Mary could point out to him that she's not owed anything for whatever reason, and if that reason gives further cause for action (such as, redirecting the 20 dollars to Mara) that's that. If on the other hand Jane, John's wife, meeting Mary earlier had rendered her the 20 dollars herself, instead of John, John's later repayment is also inadequate, through not correctly understanding the context. Remedy, again, is equally obvious and equally accessible.</p>
<p>If on the other hand John spends 20 dollars to buy bonbons, in order to gift them to Mary in order to get her to <em><a href=http://trilema.com/2014/the-romanian-language-for-other-people/>pisi stai o tura</a></em>, his action will be perfectly inadequate for a vast array of possible reasons John can not possibly ever know. For instance, Mary might be alergic to chocolate, inclined towards women, sworn to chastity or simply of the opinion that receiving sweets has absolutely nothing to do with getting laid.</p>
<p>In other words, the vastness of possible purposes, and of the many and varied contexts in which they could find themselves is lost in the darkness of the future, and as such they're not only infinite and uncountable, but even undefined! And necessarily undefined no less, as rightly established by the science of Physics. Both these unhappy considerations make activity with a view to a purpose, whatever it may be, sheer folly, or, if you prefer, windhunting.</p>
<p>So : don't go to school for <em>the purpose</em> of certification. Go, if you go, be<em>cause</em> you're interested in whatever they study there, and this on a daily basis. If you're not interested, don't go! No matter who gets upset. If it's not a good thing to steal a chicken, don't steal a chicken, no matter what noble purpose stealing the chicken may or might serve in the future. Don't lie, not as a function of what purpose the lie may or may not serve, but by virtue of the simple fact that it's not true. Examples could be had ad libitum, but... to what purpose ?</p>
<p>If you were to start today on the simple doctrine of acting absolutely, strictly and only for a cause, and never towards a purpose, no matter what that purpose may be or who might be proposing it you would gain some absolutely incredible advantages. Among them : no action or inaction further requires laborious evaluations. It's rather simple, and rather quick to come to a determination as to whether there's cause for any proposed action. It is comparatively impossible to establish if there's any purpose, or what kind of purpose would it likely be. The approaches to evaluating purposes are necessarily gross approximations, and through this perfectly open to mendacity and manipulation. Foregoing any purpose, you free yourself from the unwelcome influence of <a href=http://trilema.com/2013/i-have-no-idea-why-rape-is-against-the-law-while-marketing-is-not/>the little rape</a>, which only exists to empty your pockets and keep you working in exchange for nothing in an appealing presentation.</p>
<p>Obviously acting towards poorly defined, barely verbalized and mostly unexamined purposes has the apparent advantage of allowing the stupid man the illusion of control over the future. The simple fact of the matter is that no entity has control over its own future, outside of the regular application of some simple rules that allow for its preservation and perpetuation.</p>
<p>These simple rules are exactly one, which goes like this : act from a cause, and never towards a purpose.</p>
<p>This is the policy that ensures the permanence of the Universe, the eternity of the stars, the apparition of life<sup><a href="#footnote_1_60172" id="identifier_1_60172" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="That's right : life didn't appear on Earth for a purpose, it appeared because reasons.

						<p>"Why are we here?" The philosopher asks.</p>

						<p>One would be a fool not to examine the potential consequences of actions, its not purpose but it is forward thinking and required for survival. </p>
<p>If that fat person at the start of this article had a violent nature and was armed truth might be a very bad idea (or perhaps a unique way to try and commit suicide).</p>

						<p>@<b>Peter Lambert</b> Something like that.</p>
<p>@<b>chett</b> I defy you to construct a scenario in which one is actually served by "examining the potential consequences" as you say.</p>
<p>If the person was armed, and violent, <em>one had no cause to talk to them</em>. Armed violent people you either hunt down or ignore. See ?</p>

						<p>I am waiting to cross a street, there is a bus coming. If I step out into that street now the potential consequence is I will get hit, if I wait for the bus to pass the potential consequence is I will not get hit by the bus.</p>
<p>Of course either thing can happen no matter what I do, or don't do but I like the odds of waiting a bit better.</p>

						<p>You only cross when it's proper to cross and at no other time. If the bus comes and breaches that, you sue, because you have a cause of action.</p>

						<p>Seems to me you made a judgement to potential consequences when you choose to ignore the angry armed fat man.<br />
Its a subtle difference between purpose and forward thinking consquences but we can't toss cause and effect out of life altogether.</p>
<p>How do you decide when its 'proper' to cross? (no I am not going to trust the authority of some stupid light, can't sue em when you are dead)</p>

						<p>If you aren't going to trust the authority of some light (in general : if you're not willing to look at the situation AS IT IS) then you can't cross. </p>
<p>Put the pressure on fixing broken shit, rather than trying to go over the gaps with "forward thinking".</p>

						<p>Better to be alive to make that pressure, dead bodies can't do much.<br />
The situation, AS IT IS, is that the damned bus is ignoring the light and death ain't worth proving the point.<br />
 Light or no light stepping in front of a speeding bus is not a good idea, cause things do happen.</p>

						<p>This philosophy leads to short-sighted decisions and ultimately a lack of any great progress. It does have the benefit of freeing up time and brainpower, but that's like saying we should stop taking our cars to checkups because they cost money.<br />
You attempt to belittle the opposition by saying people are idiots that can't handle unknown factors, but the truth is that plans DO go right. Military campaigns are not a series of reactions but large, dynamic schemes. I could go on for hours about plans that worked.<br />
Further, your naturalistic argument is easily proven wrong: GMOs are much stronger than their natural counterparts to the point where superweeds are a thing. Selectively bred organisms bear the traits their breeders planned. Aboriginies did everything because and nothing for and look how that ended. Natural selection works, but unnatural selection works better.<br />
The moral isn't don't plan: It is take unknown factors into your plan. Keep it broad and dynamic instead of overcomplicating it like an autist.</p>

						<p>I really don't get why you're so worked up over the "military campaigns" thing. It was an example of something that requires planning and acting towards an end rather than simply doing the first thing that comes to mind and letting the pieces fall where they may. Sure about 50% end in failure, but that's the nature of competition.<br />
Would other examples be more fitting? Investors getting huge returns? Architects seeing the creation of a beautiful and functional city? NASA sending shit into space? The gradual degredation of muh freedoms at the illuminati's hand? All done towards an end. Not just because. That's the point: Act towards an end because plans DO succeed.<br />
Yeah and long words don't make you smart. They just make you look like a narcisist. Especially when you use them wrong, like calling someone a parrot when no rhetoric was repeated.<br />
Cvasiconsensus!</p>

						<p>It's the canonical example for situations where your notion of "planning" fails spectacularly. The fact that you'd offer that example crowns the pile of vague, never examined nonsense you sprout, transforming it into high, if unintentional, comedy.</p>
<p>I get it, you've spent your life so far hanging out with a massive shannonizer called "the US Educational System". Nevertheless, words-in/words-out is not how the world works. Trying to act irl as if you were in the US mass hallucination will never work. On the positive side, it will sometimes be very, very amusing.</p>

						<p>Can't any action simply be rephrased to accommodate acting from a cause or towards a purpose?</p>
<p>I eat because I am hungry (acting from a cause).</p>
<p>I eat so that I do not go hungry (acting towards a purpose).</p>
<p>Or in your example:</p>
<p>John gives Mary 20 dollars because Mary lent him 20 dollars last Thursday (acting from a cause).</p>
<p>John gives Mary 20 dollars to repay her for lending him 20 Dollars last Thursday (acting towards a purpose).</p>

						<p>This transformation only works if both alternatives are in the past, rendering the distinction meaningless. </p>
<p>It also explains how the error of misrepresenting action as arising from a consideration of the future came to be. In school, that bedrock of all human stupidity, a lazy teacher is confronted with explaining why a chemical reaction occurs, or why a certain military engagement took place, or why atoms move or whatever else. It being relatively difficult to explain to the children the actual causes, lazy teacher resorts to discussing what the substances/generals/atoms <em>wanted</em>. As if. This creates the ridiculous but also very dangerous and generally harmful habit of misthinking in terms of "plans". </p>
<p>The lazy imbecility of teachers aside, metallic sodium does not react with water because it "wants to" make lye, nor did Caesar move to Galia because he "wanted to" etc etc. After the fact, it may seem the two statements are equivalent. Before the fact however, they most certainly are not : the causes will necessarily remain present. The future projections, however, maybe not.</p>

						<p>Just because something is high risk doesn't mean it shouldn't be attempted. War is something that is sometimes necessary and winning it hinges entirely on a combination of effective planning and luck. Would you rather plan a campaign or beg the universe to bend in your favour?<br />
Barbarossa was a massive failure, but Germany NEEDED to invade Russia. They couldn't not invade Russia. The risk was worth the reward. Same with (most) other campaigns, from viking raids to Napoleon's empire. If you were hungry and freezing, the danger of getting stabbed by Ivan or Brother Callaghan would be far less scary than watching your wife and newborn child die. And although you will ask Odin's help, it will really just be to psych yourself and the effectiveness of your raid wil rely more on (simple as they are) tactics.</p>

						<p>"It being relatively difficult to explain to the children the actual causes, lazy teacher resorts to discussing what the substances/generals/atoms wanted."</p>
<p>It's indeed true that many minds falsely ascribe agency where it doesn't exist. Whether primitive minds thinking lightning is the attack of an angry god, or children who understand lightning as electrons 'wanting' to find the shortest path to the ground.</p>
<p>But the answer isn't to ascribe agency *nowhere*! Atoms and generals are different things. Generals have minds, atoms do not, minds are able to understand the state of the world and formulate desired future states.</p>
