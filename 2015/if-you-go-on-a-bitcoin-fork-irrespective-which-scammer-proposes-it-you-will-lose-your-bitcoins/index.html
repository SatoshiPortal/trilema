These claims are both false, on the strength of the historical record, and both are squarely rejected by the actual <a href="http://therealbitcoin.org/">Bitcoin Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>What's left is the nude reality of the matter : if you, either misguided by some scammer's malice, or simply through ignorance, actually modify your Bitcoin client to accept the nonconformant transactions, the result will be that any Bitcoin you hold will be slowly (or perhaps not so slowly, depending on your use habits) replaced by worthless scam-Bitcoins, that will not be accepted by the main players in Bitcoin anymore than they'd accept <a href="http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=irule">something you've drawn yourself</a>.</p>

						<p>Just curious, what's your stance on sidechains and Blockstream? Google search on trilema.com shows no mentions.</p>

						<p>even though i have no stakes on btc anymore, i think you are an important balancing force, there is just too much smokes and mirrors and the inner circle of the mainstream btc cult has too much influence on public perception.</p>

						<p>Well, "public perception" is principally an epiphenomenon of intellectual maturation. Kid opens eyes into the world, thinks he's the most important thing, then a little older thinks his daddy is the end all-be all Superman, then a little older still recognises a pointless drunk for a pointless drunk and moves on... it's a journey. </p>
<p>So with the public in question, first they think they have a way to "fix" Bitcoin, then they think Gavin's actually intelligent / has something meaningful to say (I don't mean code monkeying - nobody takes advice on how to organise his life from the car mechanic on the strength of "well he fixed my car..."), then they start to actually let go of themselves, and of the fear of losing themselves, and by degree and proportionally with that they also start groking wtf Bitcoin is and does and so on.</p>

						<p>Well, more like you hit a bad year. Previously I was paying for PR to knock sense into noobs / beat scammers across the head on bitcointalk, but eventually I judged it a waste of resources. </p>
<p>Anyway, Trilema is <a href=http://trilema.com/2014/awstats-and-stuff/ >widely read</a>, but obviously demographics play a large role. For one thing there's a huge market for confirmative bias, on all topics (which is how sites like social media this or that even survive - yet putting stock in that is like believing the common fork is a sort of Heidegger because hey, people hold forks in their hands a lot more than they hold Being&#038;Time). For another thing it's really not everyone's job to understand in arbitrary detail everything that's going on, nor is such even feasible. The bar for even comprehending what's being said here is far above what qualifies one for postdoctoral studies, and so you can't say Trilema is either intended or comfortable for a large majority of people.</p>
