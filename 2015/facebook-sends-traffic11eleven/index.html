mircea_popescu Aye. Just for my own amusementii, I had a subreddit created ; and seeded it with a coupla posts. One week later traffic on it ? 0. `Reddit is relevant`. To what ? `Well if you're already there it looks like there's people there`. Sure. Same is true of Grand Central station.iii
davout What's the subreddit?
mircea_popescu `No you don't understand, reddit drives traffic!!1` Orly ? It drives exactly 0, on its own.
mircea_popescu davout no, because `irrelevant` MP is going to accidentally by an apropos drive 50000% more traffic than reddit and then reddit will go `see ? REDDIT DRIVES TRAFFIC!!11`. 

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

He means Sillicon Valley. Yes, all of it.
By the way : do you know its name comes from the fact that at some point they used to make silicon ? [&#8617;]
That's right : you might not be interested in things. The things are interested in you. Only one of these two sides actually has any power, and it isn't you. [&#8617;]
Think about it : the fact that it rains now and again does not mean the ridiculous derp sitting in a conference room he can't afford, alone with a burn rate that's splitting his ass open `drove rain`. He drove nothing, rain is a natural phenomena. 
He provably has absolutely NO power to make it rain in an arbitrarily chosen spot at an arbitrarily chosen time, which is how these sorts of claims are evaluated by sane people. The fact that `it rains now and again` and `he's the one working on rain` does not create a relation between the two. Thinking otherwise is known as the attribution error, which is how chimps and very stupid people `think`. [&#8617;]

">i</a></sup> That said, it is not particularly difficult to "succeed"<sup><a href="#footnote_1_63577" id="identifier_1_63577" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The account we're discussing is a week old and has ~1k friends. It uses a Trilema picture for a background which happens to depict a woman in a red dress and heels on her knees with a shiny metal cuff on her wrist. 
This is enough to attract MULTIPLE daily chat requests, from horny males who wish to go through the following checklist : `hi` `how are you` `where are you from` `are you looking for a dude`. It diverges around the 3rd spot formally, but not substantially. Because yes, this is what God put women on this earth for : 5 billion instances a day of `hi` `how are you` `where are you from`. That's why they're here, to appreciate the smooth-as-butter variation between 4.89765976 `are you married` and 4.90932897 `do you have big tits ???`. Someone somewhere actually has time for this shit, someone somewhere actually is interested in what random derp on social media has to say privately, and that someone somewhere is supposedly ALL WOMEN EVERYWHERE. ALL THE TIME. Insanity.
`Feminism` in the monstrous, mayogendered shape it occupies today is not sent down by aliens to destroy you, it's not a conspiracy by the illuminati to oppress you. It is nemesis, a righteous infliction of punishment. It's for your sins. 
You suck, people. And the ones that `don't suck` actually suck even worse.">ii</a></sup> by the various meaningless metrics "available".<sup><a href="#footnote_2_63577" id="identifier_2_63577" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Here's the problem with meaningless metrics : not only do they deliver no actual benefit, they actually hinder thought and the accumulation of knowledge. 
Just because they're available doesn't mean they should be used. Whether they should be used or not is predicated upon whether they're meaningful, not upon whether they're shiny, or accessible, or lend themselves to easy processing with the sorts of tools you're familiar with. 
`Analytics` in the web sense of that term is roughly speaking fast-food, and that a generation of derps spend their time between `metrics` and `pizza` seems to me particularly amusing.">iii</a></sup></p>
<p>As an illustrative example : a recent "campaign"<sup><a href="#footnote_3_63577" id="identifier_3_63577" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Here's an idea of what I mean by `campaign` : Ask.fm laid bare, or what's half a million uniques to you ?
As I said, just because you're not interested in things doesn't mean things aren't interested in you. In point of fact all social media, not just Fetlife, not just any one example of the day is incredibly vulnerable. A few engineers' few hours away, a coupla scripts later, a few boxes' labour spent one can just write his own numbers. And one sometimes does - but most of the time one does not. Because here's the thing with meaningless metrics : even if you steal them, you're still losing.
If a metric is merely bad, like for instance the US Dollar is a bad metric for wealth, then getting a million dollars a thousand times easier than your greengrocer may not be a wasted exercise. It may well be true that the million is not worth a million, but it is probable it is still worth something, and it is also probable you might trade it to the greengrocer for more paltas than you'd have been able to grow on your own in the same time.
Meanwhile, if a metric is actually meaningless (like ALL web analytics, without exception), then you having stolen the million puts you in no better position than his. This is the great difference between multiplying by epsilon and multypling by zero. It matters.
The very easy error to make is to imagine that `there's no such thing as zero in nature`, and then apply this to the web. The problem with this is that we're not actually discussing nature. Yes, it is improbable to have a potato, no matter how rotten, old, stale, dry, that is actually worth zero. Nevertheless, it is not merely probable, it is an absolute certainty that if you spend an entire day, or the entire remainder of your days satisfying the `hi` `how are you` `where are you from` checklist of a billion derps you will be no further along than if you just watched TV. Which is why people watch TV instead of `communicating` or whatever.">iv</a></sup> produced </p>

<p>Awww. Strike half of the "traffic", it's directly self-generated. So what of the remainder ?</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's right, read that again : <strong>nothing</strong>.</p>
<p>A previous "campaign" running for three days a week ago resulted in... 6`058 clicks. (Hey, That's almost three thousand dollars!!11). It included a call to action. It got 0 actions.</p>
<p>The call to action wasn't for someone to <em>buy</em> something, it was for someone to <em>get paid</em>, to do something trivial. Something in the spirit of that time when a guy was claiming in #b-a that he is running a rental business, but then NOT A SINGLE ONE of his supposed renters was willing to take a picture for fifty dollars. Because people don't clip coupons to save fifty cents, that's all a dream, it never happened, it was hallucinated retrospectively.</p>
<p>If <strong>not a single one</strong> out of 6k "uniques", "visitors", "people" and what else you might wish to call these empty numbers to delude yourself (worth 3k!!1) was interested in picking up fifty bucks lying on the ground, what chances do you think you have ?<sup><a href="#footnote_5_63577" id="identifier_5_63577" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Yes, I am in the fortunate position where I can afford to spend my own money to find out the truth, and then publish it as a public service.

It may well be true that the million is not worth a million, but it is probable it is still worth something, and it is also probable you might trade it to the greengrocer for more <em>paltas</em> than you'd have been able to grow on your own in the same time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if a metric is actually meaningless (like ALL web analytics, without exception), then you having stolen the million puts you in no better position than his. This is the great difference between multiplying by epsilon and multypling by zero. It matters.</p>
<p>The very easy error to make is to imagine that "there's no such thing as zero in nature", and then apply this to the web. The problem with this is that we're not actually discussing nature. Yes, it is improbable to have a potato, no matter how rotten, old, stale, dry, that is actually worth zero. Nevertheless, it is not merely probable, it is an absolute certainty that if you spend an entire day, or the entire remainder of your days satisfying the "hi" "how are you" "where are you from" checklist of a billion derps you will be no further along than if you just watched TV. Which is why people watch TV instead of "communicating" or whatever. [<a href="#identifier_3_63577" class="footnote-link footnote-back-link">&#8617;</a>]</li><li id="footnote_4_63577" class="footnote">Hey, at the currently seen 0.01% CTR, this would be equivalent to a display ad campaign running over one million impressions, which is roughly speaking what Gawker does in a month or two.</p>
<p>So it's basically... I just borrowed Gawker's ad space for a while. Go me. [<a href="#identifier_4_63577" class="footnote-link footnote-back-link">&#8617;</a>]</li><li id="footnote_5_63577" class="footnote">Yes, I am in the fortunate position where I can afford to spend my own money to find out the truth, and then publish it as a public service.</p>
<p>It's not merely that you aren't - it's that you aren't actually taking any steps to protect and promote the functional mechanism, and to discourage and defund the dysfunctional mechanisms. How many letters to your senator did you write pointing out that he should force the SEC to <a href="http://trilema.com/2014/interacting-with-fiat-institutions-a-guide/">apply to be a MPEx subsidiary</a>, on the grounds that MPEx actually polices the fraud in its space whereas the SEC is the principal driver of fraud in its space ? </p>
<p>Ah, none ? Cool. </p>
<p>I guess the world just sucks by itself, then. It must be.</p>
<p>The thing is, though : I will regulate you <a href="http://trilema.com/forum-logs-for-19-oct-2015#1903730">whether you want to or not</a>. The only thing that's at stake is how I look upon you, nothing more. [<a href="#identifier_5_63577" class="footnote-link footnote-back-link">&#8617;</a>]</li></ol>

						<p>HOW I BECAME RICH, FAMOUS AND PROTECTED:<br />
Brothers of the world, just as the saying goes 'money makes the world goes round' My aspiration to become rich and famous was on the high side as a result of that i went on the internet search on how i can be a member of the great Brotherhood of Illuminati. I saw a blog owned by Jay Z where he said 'it's free of charge for those in America to become a member of the brotherhood' so he imputed the direct contact of the Temple Messenger together with the only assigned agent of the brotherhood USA agent Brother James Watt. I contacted agent Brother James Watt on his officials +1(617)663-8926 and he linked me up with the Temple Messenger. So the temple messenger forwarded my application to the Grand Master and i was lucky to be accepted. I was linked to my Initiation God Father (IGF) who made me observed the ten steps of initiation and i was finally inducted on the 20th night. Today i am proud to say I am a very wealthy, famous and highly protected man. my generation's future have been settled, i am extremely wealthy today is the help of Illuminati. Please if you want to be extremely rich,  famous, protected and want a settled generation, or you want to end well in life because you are already rich, and want to protect your investment and future. please become one of us today and achieve your dreams. You can contact the Illuminati assigned agent on our officials  through text message or call +1(617)663-8926. Then if you are overseas (Not in America) you can contact our internationally assigned agent on this officials through text, call or whatsapp +2348166739726. And if you wish to contact the brotherhood via the email from any part of the world our official email is <a href="mailto:illuminatikingdom56@gmail.com">illuminatikingdom56@gmail.com</a> I will be glad to meet with you on your induction day i am Brother Calson Mark, Thank you.</p>

						<p>This shit's just too great to pass on. I can about 99% of these (and yes they're  always on this article of the thousands on Trilema, and yes they're almost always from African ISPs, showing once more it wasn't such a great idea to link Africa to the Internet in the first place) but now and again the jewelry's just too intricate.</p>

						<p>This shit is so fucking entertaining... Nigerians scamming nigerians, seriously now, someone in Africa even has $5`000 to spend ? This is an insult to humanity, and a serious beef between Republic and pantsuits. Really bitch, you gave these shitheads thousands of dollars ? Fuck you, guess who's going <a href=https://i.imgur.com/TXR9DJa.jpg >into the box</a>.</p>
<p>But Ancients' beefs aside, check out these subnormals. Really, scamming each other with conceivably the dumbest scam in the book, "give us money to be included in the list of the heavenly" ? What, they've no Catholic church where they live ?</p>
<p>It's just the lulz of all time.</p>
