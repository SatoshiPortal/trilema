<p>After the numerous problems brought to light by the recent stomping Bitlove LLC (operators of Fetlife) received at my hands, it's pretty certain nobody will "invest" in a bullshit Canadian "company" consisting of one lying scumbag (John Baku) and his rent-a-coder Ruby on Rails reimplementation of Facebook. It's slightly more likely that someone might still consider going to work for them, but not by much : without money they can't afford competitive pay. Even if they tried to pay competitively<sup><a href="#footnote_0_61069" id="identifier_0_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Which, from what I hear, they never did, which in turn might explain why their software stack looks like it was made by three Pakistani web designers for five hundred dollars.">i</a></sup>, burn rates being what they are the very poor job security implicit in the package is likely to keep anyone even half qualified away. It's also altogether improbable they'll be making further strides in conning chumps to sign up their "services" at any sort of a rate approaching the user flight they're experiencing (and for good reason), but that doesn't usually matter online : if Baku could puff up a 50-100k actual userbase into "three million", there's nothing to prevent him from turning a 15% userbase loss into "fastest growing" or whatever hollow verbiage is fashionable that week.</p>
<p>This sad state of affairs is of course not reflected in the Kool Aid being poured generously (behind closed walls) in the trough of a mostly naive, broadly ignorant audience. Let's look into this - it promises to be fun. </p>
<blockquote><h1>We Are Not Being "Outed" and There Hasn't Been a "Security Breach" (But Trilema is Still a Huge Douche &#038; Fetlife Needs to Reconsider its Privacy Mechanisms)</h1>
<p><em>Ikonoclast's Writing  29M Dom (Sandy, Utah) | 462 Comments Â· 2,504 Love It | 12 days ago </em></p>
<p>Hokay folks. I am seeing a lot of (what I suspect is mostly unintentional) fearmongering about this gigantic douchecanoe<sup><a href="#footnote_1_61069" id="identifier_1_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Apparently there's an entire kabuki relating to the proper adjectives, nouns, adverbs, comparatives and so on that SJWs are permitted to use when discussing politically charged topics. For some reason these all seem to be references to a particular vaginal hygiene device widely employed in uncivilised spaces where females lack access to a bidet. 
I suspect this is presumed to be offensive to someone, somewhere, though I can scarcely imagine why exactly. Then again, having lived most of my life riding around in my atomic dirigible / golden helicopter with my slaves and my money, far far removed from the problems of the TGI Tuesdays crowd (`let's solve the problem of fastfood merely pretending to be food by merely pretending it's not really fastfood`), I seem to be missing some memos. 
Should anyone feel inclined to clue me in, I confess a purely professional interest in the topic - I am, after all, sort-of a practicing anthropologist and the SJWs are quite certainly a degenerate sort of monkey, not quite autonomous enough to make it with the chimps in the wild yet not quite sophisticated enough to make it with the humans in the towns. Any material you might have handy will be appreciated.">ii</a></sup> in my feed today, replete with comments like "This is outing everyone!", "When is Fetlife going to fix this breach of security?", "I wish there was a better site than Fetlife so this wouldn't happen", etc., as well as loads of female-identified members changing their gender to N/A. </p>
<p>While Trilema<sup><a href="#footnote_2_61069" id="identifier_2_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="It's very strange to me that I'd be referenced by the name of my blog, especially seeing how my name's right there, and the guy actually is aware of this. What sense does this make ?">iii</a></sup> is absolutely, incontestably a misogynistic, entitled fuckwad with a vastly overinflated sense of his own hacker $ki11Z<sup><a href="#footnote_3_61069" id="identifier_3_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="It is also very strange to me that this claim is made. While I do have a very good sense of the superiority of my skills, this is on one hand very well documented, and on the other hand impersonal. Yes, I'm one of the maybe five people currently drawing breath who can run a Bitcoin service safely, out of thousands of varied and assorted failures. Nevertheless, I disclaim `hacker skills` publicly and with some regularity (I don't see `$ki11Z` seriously contemplated by anyone) and so on. The articles discussing the Fetlife failure to thrive on the web certainly don't make any such claims, but on the contrary. For that matter, the one line of bash employed is actually published.
It almost seems like the general public has an array of preloaded notions on various topics, and so if anything to do with the appalling security of some scamsite is forcefully brought to the fore by individual action they automatically misrepresent the situation as `the actor claimed mad $ki11Z`, whether this actually happened or not. If this process actually exists it would go a long way to explain a number of hallucinogenic avatars of US political discourse, for instance. I would like to also underscore that this pseudo-thinking process of the cvasi-chimpanzee mind is, historically, how the Jews ended up `killing goy boys to make blood-Challah` and so on. Maybe something the chimps in question themselves would be well advised to keep a close eye on ? (It's also how advertising works, by the way, which is why you're poor and frustrated).">iv</a></sup>, I'm concerned by these comments and actions because they speak to a certain ignorance about 1) what "outing" is, 2) the nature of information privacy on a semipublic site like fetlife, 3) the difference between a security breach and an information crawl, and 4) what it would actually take to build a "better site" to stop this sort of thing from happening. So, let's talk about those things.</p>
<p>What is "Outing?"</p>
<p>Outing is a pretty explicit action. It is the connection, without your consent, of your vanilla existence to your kink existence (Or exposure of any private information related to your sexual orientation, relationship dynamic, or other aspects of yourself you choose to keep private.) In that view of the term, I can't really say Trilema has "Outed" anyone because 1) there is no Personally Identifiable Information (What we in the data world call PII)<sup><a href="#footnote_4_61069" id="identifier_4_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Check it out, `we in the data world`. What is this `data world` ? Who's in it ?
Are `we` in the making up words as we go along world part of a low income bracket pretending the contrary or not ?">v</a></sup> in the table he's dumped on his site. 2) none of the information he posted was truly private.<sup><a href="#footnote_5_61069" id="identifier_5_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="And it was also not a real Scotsman!">vi</a></sup> Yes, it was behind a password-protected site that didn't offer a search function, but literally anyone can create a profile on that site and there is currently no way to set age and gender identity as "friends only".<sup><a href="#footnote_6_61069" id="identifier_6_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Doesn't this miss the point ?">vii</a></sup> 3) None of the information he's posted is verifiable beyond the Fetlife ID in the links he's posted. Since anyone can set their name, age, location, and orientation to any value they wish, any information beyond that Fetlife ID is unreliable at best.<sup><a href="#footnote_7_61069" id="identifier_7_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Anyone can also set their name to any value they wish, I have a friend that's done exactly that and as a result had to re-buy his US-exit-to-Argentina tax token.">viii</a></sup></p>
<p>How does information privacy work on Fetlife?</p>
<p>Unless you can set it to "Friends Only," you should operate on the expectation that literally everyone on the Internet can see it. That includes your mom, your pastor, your 14-year-old kid, Barack Obama, and of course Trilema. And, as SupremeOverlord points out in the comments below, even if you set a photo to "Friends Only" it is still accessible, though not without considerable effort/not in a "searchable" way, without even accessing Fetlife in the first place by going directly to Fetlife's image host domain).<sup><a href="#footnote_8_61069" id="identifier_8_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Quite searchable, but I'm kinda lazy atm. Plus I lack the requisite `skills`.
Take, for instance, user Ikonoclast (#48475). Would you believe that all his pictures appear under... fetlife.com/users/48475/pictures ? Clearly, it is not trivially searchable. You can not simply add /pictures to the end of any profile url in the meatlist and thus obtain a nicely sorted view of all their pictures - and I certainly couldn't trivially iterate all this through the exact mechanisms already described. 
Here's a hint :

Here's my favourite from his collection : 

Not bad, huh.">ix</a></sup></p>
<p>What does this mean for you? Well, if you don't want there to be a chance some dipshit will stumble across and save the info, possibly posting it to an external site, DON'T POST IT. Period. While I understand that, in an ideal world, everyone would respect your desire for privacy and ownership of your data, reality doesn't align with that desire at this point in time, and it probably never will.<sup><a href="#footnote_9_61069" id="identifier_9_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Actually, the fix is quite trivial, but why think, right ? PR's not paid to think, PR's paid to pretend.">x</a></sup></p>
<p>What the fuck is an "information crawl?"</p>
<p>What Captain Douchenozzle has likely done<sup><a href="#footnote_10_61069" id="identifier_10_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Except for the part where I actually said exactly what I did. BTW, does curl and grep qualify one for `$ki11Z` ?">xi</a></sup> to get his information, given the relatively small section of the female members of the site he's posted, is point a webcrawler (Basically an automated web browser) at Fetlife with his login credentials, browse through the site one ID at a time (note how Fetlife IDs are numeric, e.g. mine, which is users/48475), and scrape the following information:<br />
Name<br />
Profile URL (And thus Fetlife ID #)<br />
Age<br />
BDSM Role<br />
Sexual Orientation<br />
Location</p>
<p>His crawler then dumped this information into a database (Or a flat file, like a .csv, think of this sort of like a spreadsheet with rows and columns, etc.) where he could easily query it with "show me all female-identified people whose age is less than 30." Clean up the output, preserve the hyperlinks when you put it into an HTML table, and voila!</p>
<p>Why is this not really a security breach? Because any idiot could do it<sup><a href="#footnote_11_61069" id="identifier_11_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="By this reasoning, writing War and Peace What Is It Good For is not literature, because similarly any idiot could have done it. For that matter, even an infinite number of monkeys equipped with typewriters could have done. On the other hand, the practical verification of this ancient conjecture as implemented by `the social web` seems to fall short. Maybe they need more infinite time.">xii</a></sup>, and once again the information is not really protected - a real security breach involves accessing data you're not supposed to be able to access<sup><a href="#footnote_12_61069" id="identifier_12_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This somehow made sense, at some point, I'm told.">xiii</a></sup>, i.e. passwords or email addresses. Does it constitute a breach of the Fetlife TOU? Absolutely.<sup><a href="#footnote_13_61069" id="identifier_13_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Actually, it doesn't, as random nobodies don't get to foist `TOU` on people.">xiv</a></sup> Is it pursuable from a criminal standpoint? Probably not.<sup><a href="#footnote_14_61069" id="identifier_14_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="`Pursuable from a criminal standpoint` doesn't make a whole lot of sense, unless Internet lawyer is also Internet District Attorney.">xv</a></sup> Civil?

Sucks to be them, I guess.">xvi</a></sup> However, given Doucheface's name (Which he helpfully includes on his blog), he's probably from Romania (or one of the other Central/Eastern European countries) and getting them to honor lawsuits filed by North American nations is a bitch and a half.<sup><a href="#footnote_16_61069" id="identifier_16_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Actually, the DMCA counter-notification does specify an US venue and it dutifully includes a service address.

<p>Why doesn't changing my gender help?</p>
<p>Okay, so it might help, kind of. But only if you weren't already included in his idiotic little "meat list." Remember what I said about his crawler scraping the User ID? That doesn't change, so you can change your Fetlife gender to "big, hairy manbearpig" and if you were on the list before, you'll still be on it.</p>
<p>So how do we protect against this sort of shit?</p>
<p>Remember my points in the "How does information privacy work on Fetlife?" section. In the short term, that is literally all you can do.</p>
<p>In the mid-term, Fetlife should probably consider making some of the basic profile information (Gender identity, age, location) settable to "Friends only" so folks concerned about their privacy can manage those as they wish.</p>
<p>In the long term? The only way to really improve the privacy of the site itself is to use an invitation-only membership structure, and I just don't see that happening in an enterprise like Fetlife. That sort of design, if people take the vetting rules seriously, takes years to realize membership numbers that will let you operate without losing money, so unless someone with $8-10,000 a month in extra disposable income wants to set that up out of the goodness of their heart<sup><a href="#footnote_17_61069" id="identifier_17_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I might, actually, except it by definition wouldn't be open to the sort of retards involved here. So...
Anyway, the word he's looking for is WoT.">xviii</a></sup>, it's kind of a long shot. And, lest we forget, it still will not be 100% safe. People will still make errors in character judgment and invite predatory jackoffs, long-standing community members will suddenly be revealed as abusive, consent-violating assholes, etc.</p>
<p>TL:DR;</p>
<p>Look, I know what Trilema did a couple months ago (and seemingly hasn't updated, mercifully) sucks. I know it's scary to think you're more searchable now. But the real fallout of this is likely<sup><a href="#footnote_18_61069" id="identifier_18_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="My bet is that the fallout of this is an end to Bitlove, actually. I guess we see what a year brings.">xix</a></sup> to be nothing more than a few more creepy messages in your inbox than usual; he made you easier to find, but he didn't make you easier to identify if you're already protecting your identity well on Fetlife.</p>

P.S.:</p>
<p>I'm not trying to say people shouldn't be concerned by what's happened here, or even that the outrage needs to be toned down; my worry is with where the outrage is being directed, because from my perspective a lot of people are angry about the wrong things.</p>
<p>In no particular order, some of the bigger issues here (and elsewhere) are<br />
1) Fetlife sent a DMCA takedown about this information months ago. Why are we only finding out about it now?<br />
2) Fetlife has known the "Creeper contingent" is an issue on this site for ages, and yet no real proactive steps have been taken to empower people to dodge them.<br />
3) Privacy controls here are currently limited to writings and photos, while huge swaths of other information can be crawled by any jackass with access to the site. Even Facebook has better options.<sup><a href="#footnote_19_61069" id="identifier_19_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Except the `photos` bit turned out to be just another lie on the lightest of examinations. What now.">xx</a></sup><br />
4) The "no talking about repeat predators" thing - need I say more?</p>
<p>I'm sure I'm missing things, but the reality is that until Fetlife drastically reconsiders the nature of "privacy" on the site, the onus to do so is on us as users.</p>

<p>Now this takes a rational look at what's really going on. There's PLENTY FetLife can do to make things better...but some of it would require almost a complete site redesign on the back-end. They're (pretty obviously, if you'd paid attention to their response to this and other "breaches") unwilling to put forth the effort to do that, and instead rely on misinformation and placing all blame on the douches that point out their nakedness.</p>
<p>Then there's the heavy-handed approach at misusing the legal system (the DMCA notice, in this case) to try to silence their failures...which reminds me a lot of how Scientology shut down anything critical to itself back in the day.<sup><a href="#footnote_24_61069" id="identifier_24_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="You know it's funny, because that's exactly what the lawyer said. `So is this BDSM thing like a Scientology offshot or something ?`">xxv</a></sup></p>

<p>I'm glad to see someone pointing out that this is more of an info crawl/dump than a security breach. I don't see his code as "outing" anyone yet, but I do see it as a tool that individuals could easily use to out people. Say if someone at your job suspected you had a kinky secret life, it makes it that much easier to find your profile and show your boss.</p>
<p>Fetlife isn't a perfect website by any means, but the one thing that I have actually always appreciated is the lack of a search function like Trilema is attempting/suggesting. I'm sure a lot of people on Fetlife are attempting to use it as a dating service, but this isn't OKCupid.</p>
<p>Also, when it comes to BDSM, at the end of the day the community is a huge and important aspect to it. Without other people around it's much harder to vet potential partners, to catch predators before they go too far, or even to have real camaraderie in the scene itself. It's clear that the community aspect of BDSM means nothing to Trilema or to people have the same opinion, and that's worrisome.</p>
<p>tl;dr if you want to just find girls who are DTF you should just go get on OKCupid like everyone else</p>

<p>Yes, we need to understand that online privacy doesn't exist. You can set your location to Antarctica but the groups you join say a lot about where you live. Last year I tried an an experiment; I was able to, after some digging, find out a Fet guy's real name, home address, make/model of car (Google street view of home), job, and hobbies. I was surprised at how easy it was, just by gleaning info from his posts and the fact that part of his Fet name was part of his real name. I never did anything with the info, and I never will; but it was an eye-opening exercise.</p>

<p>Honestly this is probably a good thing IMHO. Why? Because too many do put alot of identifiable info on here, or pictures that are also on other well known social media sites. This kinda serves as a reality check that FetLife is not the Kinky DMZ of the internet. General internet rule of thumb is once its posted, it can't be erased, and someone you didn't intend to see it, will. So this is a great reality check. Anyone that knows how to view a pages source has long been able to get the URL of pictures, download them, search them with TinyEye, google, or such, and well. Its not really safe.<br />
visiting a local dungeon has the benefit of "mutually assured destruction, meaning if a coworker or boss sees you there.... You see them too. But on Fet, where its all fairly anonymous, well just think twice before you post up a face pic, or phone number or anything else that can tie you to the real world.<br />

<p>Now the flip side of this is how FetLife responds (if at all). It could be awesome - adjustable public/friends only settings for various things like age and gender and location, or it could SUCK (all of them are either public or friends only, no granularity).</p>
<p>When thousands of profile names are added to a non-Fet list, it's a real douche move, but seriously, how many creeps are going to sift through it all? Even if they did, the only way they can get to people is by SIGNING UP. For that matter, it's still possible for people to crawl through local lists and manually search for targets. Chances are, these kinds of knuckle-draggers will have a big question mark or a dick pic for their profile pic, and savvy ladies won't fall for it.</p>
<p>What pisses me off is that this guy is saying FetLife is a DATING site. For those of us in the lifestyle for years, sure, we use it to meet people, but mostly it's for networking with others we either know or meet at munches. I really wish people would stick to other venues for their 50 Shades of Adultery and HowRULetsFuck shenanigans.

<p>My only problem with the list is fet should have told the girls that are on that list that it happened. Just like my credit card company would tell me if my information was taken even the public stuff and posted on another site (yes this has happened I was told the day they found it). You don't have to believe it but these girls are now at risk not of their nilla friends and family finding out but of being hurt. He picked the age group that posts the most naked public available pictures with the persons face in it. We all know creepers use this site and others like it to find their victims. These girls/women are now on a user friendly list of potential victims.</p>

<p>I have no specific issues with this post.<br />
My issue is exclusively on the access to our images, and other data therein.</p>
<p>Just because "it's on a website" should not just mean "it's publicly accessible for the world to see".</p>
<p>Being in IT security where DPA is integral to my job, as far as I am concerned any form of data access through a website which is password protected, and offers subscription based services with adverts for very highly paid development posts should at the very least be capable of ensuring the user profile and images etc etc etc stored on the website and through the databases held therein are only accessible via those members who are logged in.</p>
<p>Any link, should prompt a user to log in or sign up.</p>
<p>It is that simple.</p>
<p>I am aware of exactly how, and why this happens. After all even the biggest companies in the world get their data hacked, but quite simply, a service which is paid for should not be so easy to access.</p>

<p>I don't think fetlife had any obligation to make this known to anyone. As we can see, it just leads to misunderstanding of what actually happened and fear mongering. All this guy did was break the part of the TOU that says you're not allowed to run a script on bitloves data, and he was (presumably) removed from the site, if he ever had an account, for violating the TOU. But what he did wasn't illegal, we don't need to be notified that someone did something icky but not actually wrong. Fetlifes TOU also says you're not allowed to fantasize about sex with a dog. Doing it is illegal, thinking about it isn't, I don't need to be notified every time someone gets thrown off the site for their dog erotica that is fucking icky but not actually illegal.<sup><a href="#footnote_60_61069" id="identifier_60_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This is perhaps the most contorted bit of Fetlovesplainin' I saw yet.

<p>Further, there's nothing the users can do outside of deactivate their accounts. Changing any of the info that list is filtered by doesn't remove you from the list, so what have you actually gained with this knowledge, what are you doing about it, short of removing yourself from the Internet? You might be rethinking those face photos or considering being a little more careful...but that's not fetlifes job either.</p>
<p>The more fetlife makes their job, the more they open themselves up to being liable for that one time they slip up, or when someone with a lot of time and money feels like they were failed by fetlife even if fetlife did their job correctly.

Seriously, how is society going to change is we are hiding in closets.<br />
Look at the way the gay community has emerged from their closet (though it took them years to get this much mainstream acceptance), yet the majority of the BDSM community wants to stay hidden in a trunk in the basement. Attitudes won't change until people change them, and if your only outlet to the world is through fetlife, you're doing the community a disservice.<br />

<p>What the douchecanoe did is completely wrong, and non-consensual. It needs to be attended to by a proud sadist in a dungeon away from prying eyes and witnesses, by someone who really enjoys it.<br />
Fetlife should have been fast to respond and handle this situation, and I've not seen any evidence they've been aggressive at all, and should have more privacy protections available for those who want them.</p>

<p>a) craves attention, so the more crumbs the post is given, the more 'streisand effect' will happen, which is what he seeks.</p>
<p>b) Clearly doesn't understand the fet world nor the social network context of fetlife. he might even be one of these sad 'PUA' boys with no social skills.<sup><a href="#footnote_67_61069" id="identifier_67_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Or he might be a stove. Why not ?">lxviii</a></sup></p>
<p>c) has a lot of insecurity regarding his own intellect and technical ability ... not how he keeps calling others morons, etc for supposed flaws in their code or understanding of technical things.<sup><a href="#footnote_68_61069" id="identifier_68_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Or he could actually have little patience for idiots. Why not ?">lxix</a></sup></p>
<p>d) meanwhile, his own code is inept, to put it mildly. Do view-source on his lists and you'll see HTML tables, wow, extremely inefficient and years out of date. it's how a noob would code.<sup><a href="#footnote_69_61069" id="identifier_69_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I.. can't... even.
Seriously, putting tables in a table element is how noobs would code ? How does the cool crowd do it, stuff everything in a scrolling ajax container ? Mmmkay.">lxx</a></sup> All he did was copy an existing scraping script and modify it<sup><a href="#footnote_70_61069" id="identifier_70_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Aaactually... no. All you people getting all insecure about computing : get off Windows, and learn to bash. You'll be shocked what can be done in one line.">lxxi</a></sup> - ineptly again, as it comes up with lots of inactives, dommes, inappropriate, and duplicate profiles, etc. so we aren't looking at a tech wonderkind here.</p>
<p>So, short term, fetlife could:</p>
<p>1) block referrer codes from that domain<sup><a href="#footnote_71_61069" id="identifier_71_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="O wow... I didn't know we had an expert over here. Fetlife could also backtrace it, amirite ?">lxxii</a></sup>, or better yet, redirect them to honeypot profiles designed to identify users who created profiles just to contact members of the list.... maybe even send them bogus autoreplies so they waste lots of time.</p>
<p>2) send alerts to users who appear on the list, or better yet, when any external backlink to one's profile is detected. easy.</p>
<p>3) also flag messages from accounts which appear to be newly created after a referral from some external link.</p>
<p>finally don't panic it feeds the instigator's sense of self-importance.<sup><a href="#footnote_72_61069" id="identifier_72_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Twisted instigata!">lxxiii</a></sup></p>

<p>@Baroness_Rips Since when has fetlife been a paid for service, I get it for free. If I try to follow a link without being logged in then I am requested to login which surely meets your criteria.</p>
<p>Once logged in I can do manually what the script used can do and copy the data into a spreadsheet/database. Of course my bandwidth is limited and it will take me quite a long time to access some 3,000,000 accounts but I can do it (unless I have been blocked by a user).</p>
<p>The list created by the script only provides links to which users meet the selection criteria but you still need to be signed in to see the full profile.</p>
<p>Yes the guy is unpleasant but neither he nor Fetlife are in breach of the DPA as no personal data has been revealed other than that which you (the fetlife user) have made available to the public (any member of the public can join fetlife and view the same data).</p>
<p>As many people will say if you don't want it to be in the public domain then don't put it on the internet.</p>
<p>I do understand the concerns raised by the young ladies on the list but the guy has only broken the TOU of fetlife, not the law of any jurisdiction, and the script he published can be used (with suitable modification) by any member to find other members who match the criteria they specify.</p>
<p>I do think that fetlife should be more responsible and if they don't want a search on the site then they should make it more difficult for others to develop one especially as they have been told how to close this specific loophole and seem unable to do so.</p>

<p><em>LilClouds: 12 days ago</em></p>
<p>While I largely agree with you, I do consider being able to enumerate the users from a database to be a security flaw. Vulnerability may be too strong of a word as it does not give any direct means of exploiting the security of the system. And to be honest, if you're putting your information on a site that allows unrestricted sign-up, you can't be too mad about 'anonymous' users accessing your profile.</p>
<p>All this being said, as I'm sure you're well aware, the solution to the problem is relatively simple; I only wonder if it's implementation that is a bit complicated for the system that they already have in place (although I couldn't imagine it being too big of an issue).</p>
<p>As far as the other privacy issues......yeah......<sup><a href="#footnote_78_61069" id="identifier_78_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Actually, casual inspection of their RoR backend by anyone with any serious experience will reveal so many holes it's not even funny.">lxxix</a></sup></p>

<p>@ikonoclast: I agree with the points you made, but the bottom line is that this explanation should have come from fet proper, when the issue was discovered. As with politics, it's not the fuck up, it's the cover up that scares and pisses people off. If fet had gotten in front of this, they could have told the community what happened and what the ramifications were.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that's not how it went down. A good number of people saw the post, went to the linked website and saw language about "security breach" without the information or technical knowledge to understand what really happened. Shame on Fet for lacking basic customer service and PR know-how.</p>
<p>Also, although it's not a technical "security breach", it still appears to be a security flaw. I have to believe that fet developers intentionally designed fet so it isn't searchable. To the extent it is so easy to develop your own functionality, this appears to be a failing. You can't make things impossible to circumvent, but this seems like really low-hanging fruit.<sup><a href="#footnote_79_61069" id="identifier_79_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="That's because it is.">lxxx</a></sup></p>

<p><em>ViolinsOfAutumn: 12 days ago</em></p>
<p>In technical terms, enumerating accounts like this is called a "Direct Object Reference". It's not a traditional security flaw, but it's sometimes discouraged for security reasons partly as it allows this kind of intrusive usage.</p>
<p>Replacing user IDs with an indirect reference (i.e. getting rid of user IDs) or random GUID might help, but would be hard to implement, break all sorts of things, and potentially make the site less user friendly &#038; URLs quite ugly (or direct linking to profiles impossible). It probably wouldn't prevent someone from spidering the site and building a database of users another way.</p>
<p>Perhaps more effectively, fetlife could attempt to throttle accounts accessing multiple profiles to prevent automated abuse - potentially in conjunction with temporary account bans (for instance, for accounts that accessed hundreds of profiles in a few hours), or a CAPTCHA to attempt to prevent scripted access. These aren't perfect solutions, but they potentially make this sort of information gathering much harder to accomplish (or impractically time-consuming).</p>
<p>More granular privacy controls aren't a bad thing, and it's also never a bad idea to consider anything put on fetlife to be 'public' unless it's access controlled.</p>
<p>Going beyond the technical stuff, a huge +1 on the OP &#038; others' comments to the effect that whatever the technical details, this is a toxic and intrusive thing to have done. Invoking 'chilling effects' wording in an attempt to brand attempts by fetlife to take down this information as anti-democratic or oppressive is also a pretty cynical thing to do.</p>
<p><em>everchanging: 12 days ago</em></p>
<p>I agree with what you have to say... but you may want to consider that some of the people changing their profiles aren't just overreacting. Perhaps you should consider that for some of us it was the push we needed to further protect our identities. I wasn't included in the list because I'm too old, but the list made me realize that one day it might be easier for a coworker to find me based on my age, gender, and location. Personally the list just motivated me to make the changes I felt were necessary to protect myself. Last summer a man at my workplace was showing other men fetlife profiles of local women. I should have changed my info then, for me this list was the push I needed to make changes that I feel good about... just something to think about.</p>

<p>@SupremeOverlord - I wouldn't think so. There's always the possibility of someone spoofing the cookie, but as I'm sure you're aware the ultimate goal of a security measure isn't to make things unbreakable, but to make them such a pain in the ass to circumvent that most attackers get frustrated/bored and fuck off to an easier target.</p>

<p>@Supremeoverlord the site will already use cookies to keep track of who you are and if you're logged in - but there isn't really a direct use of them which would prevent this sort of flaw. The most cost-effective mitigation is probably some sort of throttling (which could include revoking session cookies - i.e. forcibly logging users out - if they're abusive).</p>

<p>@jkonclast - it is certainly possible for fetlife counteract automated crawlers, and many sites built with security in mind have such controls in place. You can try rate limiting (which makes the crawler much less effective) or ids rules which flag users who use sequential queries.<sup><a href="#footnote_82_61069" id="identifier_82_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="`Enumerating badness` doesn't work for the reason it doesn't work.

What the #/&#038;$#" who violated the TOU (which was obviously his intention from the beginning) did is just the simple thing that many could do.

<p>Meh. There are things that can be done to prevent scraping to some extent. I understand that are info is basically public, but if a user was able to scrape that much data in a short period of time then fetlife should have better practices and monitoring in place on the backend. I'm not concerned about the scraped data as far as that info, but in the 'If Fetlife couldn't prevent a simple site scrape, then how well is the rest of my data protected' type of thing.</p>

<p><em>Teach-HoH: 12 days ago</em></p>
<p>@ViolinsOfAutumn: most scrapping scripts don't use ocr.

<p>@Teach-HoH: there are a bunch of tools out there for solving captchas - it wouldn't be at all hard to plug one into a scraping script and use it to turn the appropriate bits of the page into text whilst harvesting; maybe an hour or two's work.</p>
<p>There are plenty of bad captchas which are vulnerable to this, and captchas are designed to be difficult for humans to read. It's unlikely presenting information meant to be easy to read would be compatible with defeating even a fairly rudimentary scraping script built in this way.</p>
<p>Even if you solve this problem, you have an accessibility problem - this would immediately make the site less friendly for visually impaired users. And the bandwitg dth cost of an additional 20-30KiB per page may not be inconsiderable. Security sometimes makes things less efficient, but there's always a trade-off and it needs to be thought through. I'm not sure if the benefit here would outway the various costs - bandwidth-wise, cost-of-implementation-wise, or accessibility-wise.</p>
<p>So sure, definitely worth investigating or discussing. My money's on rate limiting or throttling as the most effective first-order mitigation, though.</p>

<p><em>Forbin70: 12 days ago</em></p>
<p>Op, you sir, win the internet for the day. Deftly handled.</p>
<p>Fetlife is still the internet. While many of us may have always been comfortable here and some of us may have recently decided to be more out and have become more comfortable here (that would be me), its STILL the internet and no one has any reasonable expectation of privacy beyond what simple friends-only features can offer. Your public photos and writings in all forms here are, like it or not, out in the jungle once you post them. No matter how much anyone wishes or insists the contrary should be the case. Those are the simple facts.</p>
<p>The fact is, webcrawlers happen all the time, it's just in this case it seems it was for less than nice or honorable reasons. But as the OP points out, it is NOT a hack or even a crack. It does nothing that a person with enough time and effort couldn't do by hand.<sup><a href="#footnote_89_61069" id="identifier_89_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="How the fuck do `hacks or even cracks` happen, by divine transsubstantiation ?">xc</a></sup></p>
<p>And I think this is an opportune time to point out to the party players, local community folks, and social networkers that all of the above is why not everyone is comfortable with having a detailed profile, photos displayed, or attending local events: Because many choose to UNDERSTAND and grasp the simple realities of the internet and the real life world and they want to maintain their privacy for any of a number of legitimate reasons that are no one else's business to know or question.</p>
<p>So, before people go bandying about suggestions that having an undetailed profile, a lack of photos, or no interest in attending local munches and events are RED FLAGS they might consider that the people they are attempting to shame and cajole from doing things in the ways in which they, personally, are comfortable, that those people may simply just have a better grasp on the reality that this is the internet and the world is as it is than they do. Or just simply don't accept the risks associated with it as they do. I see this constantly on FetLife and it was at an epidemic level amongst many in my local area in particular for quite a while, although it seems to have toned down a bit of late, thankfully.</p>
<p>In fact, I would go so far as saying such a thing constitutes a consent violation on a level. Simply because YOU have had a good experience with social networking here and because YOU have had a good experience with going to events and gatherings, local or otherwise, and because YOU accept the risks of exposing yourself to whatever degree publicly irl and on FetLife doesn't mean that everyone is. And it is no one's business to suggest that they are required to be. Suggestions to the contrary are not only wrong, but they are pretty fucking obnoxious, too, IMO. And, here, we see why that is, exactly.</p>
<p>Thank you again, OP.</p>

<p>Ok, this is not going to give any comfort, but the reality is once certain borders are crossed the DMCA is not worth it's weight in used toilet paper. It simply will not be enforced. Second, to make a site really difficult to crack would take some serious money and serious hackers on the payroll. Fetlife probably has neither. A good cracker can probably access the entire database in less than an hours work. And a website that comes down can be back up in a very short time. Blocking never works very long. There are too many ways around it.</p>
<p>The wisest course is to assume that everything you put on here is going to end up on a website out of Russia and nothing can be done to stop it.</p>

<p>I agree with the comments of the OP but I would like to consider what is now possible, because of this searchable list of FetLife accounts, that was more difficult before it was published.</p>
<p>It is now possible to go through the profiles of all 30 year old ladies who live in... say Brighton... one by one and examine their photographs and writing. The point being... if you know Brighton well you might be able to identify somebody from some background detail or some hint in their writing.</p>
<p>Of course this was possible before the publication of this list, but it would have been much more difficult to target all the profiles, of a defined age group and sex, all from one location.</p>
<p>DD</p>
<p><em>Wainskote: 12 days ago</em></p>
<p>Fetlife could also include code to detect potential crawling and data scraping, and either flag it to a person for action, or automatically disable the account doing the scraping. OK Cupid does this, for example. Its a fairly standard thing to do, for companies that sell access to databases.</p>

...why are you using IE? Seriously, now THAT'S a safety violation.</p>
<p>As for this...absolutely this is not a hack. And, frankly, as it's publicly available information, (and it IS publicly available information. No ID of any sort is required to sign in to this website, anyone can join, and is thus, by any practical definition, public) any legal issue is purely in methodology, not in the publication itself. Immoral, yes, beyond question. Illegal, not likely.

<p><em>ViolinsOfAutumn: 12 days ago</em></p>
<p>@noisefreak randomly-generated GUIDs would be the most obvious thing, but at the cost of nasty URLs. Facebook does something ~similar using a combination of an ID and the custom URL ( /profile.php?id=ID will redirect to the custom URL), which is probably not a bad balance of usability and ease of implementation, and would be simple to do with non-incremental IDs and a huge searchspace.</p>
<p><em>Observer: 12 days ago</em></p>
<p>I think that it shows that a lot of people have a sense of false security - if it is visible by users, it's searchable by a computer, and it can be collected etc. I think that the "size" of the internet (millions, billion of users!) give people the impression that they have "the anonymity of the crowd"). We do not.</p>

The fact remains that Fetlife needs lots of people (and lots of dollars) that it doesn't have to do these things. If Bitlove and co. made any mistakes, it was at the beginning when they didn't put mechanisms in place to control growth, but that horse left the gate long ago.<br />

<p><em>MrProsser: 12 days ago</em><br />
Do what I did send an email with links to his countries cyber division. While the DMCA couldn't stop him hacking is still illegal and he admits to it.</p>
<p>What was done is not hacking, unless some massive new information has come in, where they have admitted to finding an exploit to access Fetlife servers and database, so I doubt anything will come of that. They just automated the process of looking at the website, logging in using their credentials, and crawling the pages, saving the data, automatically rather than manually looking at each profile. Someone that has a lot of time on their hands could do the same thing manually.</p>
<p>I do not understand why Fetlife issued the DMCA request, it seems to have no basis, was bound to go nowhere, and just end up being used to smear them. I seem to remember them doing something similar a few years ago when a similar event happened, where people signed up to a third-party service that saved their data, and they were rightfully taken to task for that.</p>

Of course, the other thing I've observed (that's likely the case here) is mitigation tactics like these are usually on a list of things to handle which are ignored until someone exploits them in big, splattery embarrassing ways.</p>

<p>There are companies where compiling and selling this information is a business model (eg. Facebook, Twitter etc). Companies do this ALL the time. If FetLife were to go bankrupt, what do you think the bankruptcy lawyer would sell (It happened to RadioShack recently when they went bankrupt)?<sup><a href="#footnote_96_61069" id="identifier_96_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Excellent point, as it happens.

<p>The way this person did it is to get a rise out of people but it shows how little people think about their privacy online and the endless possibilities of damage someone with even minimal technical skills can do.</p>
<p>I personally have developed a minimal API to post events to FetLife from Drupal Rules and the code is also open, took me an hour. A "search" function is equally trivial, I've thought about making an anonymous 'friends heat map' for purely informational purposes but I don't have the time to spend on non-functional pieces.</p>
<p>There is no 'fix' for this issue. If you don't want to be found, don't post your info. FetLife allows you to see any pictures on the site without needing to login, that can be fixed, disallowing people to copy info they can already see is impossible.</p>
<p><em>SwaggedyAnn:  11 days ago</em></p>
<p>Semi-unrelated, but Trilema is nuttier than squirrel shit, and his writing definitely shows it.</p>
<p>Trigger warning: completely next-level misogyny and references to rape ahead.</p>
<p>Selected quotes:<br />
The woman's job is to find a great man (not good, by the way), suck his cock, wash his socks and write his eulogy. That's it, forget all the rest of the shit you think you're doing with careers and "your own life" and whatnot, it's an exercise in derpitudinous ridicule. There isn't a life outside of life. This is life...<br />
The point of an eulogy is to use the surviving woman's worthless body to pay homage to the very valuable, now extinct soul of the man. Thus the best eulogy is suicide on the grave...<br />
Great men don't get the eulogies they deserve and artificially inflated boobs get eulogies they don't deserve because women have turned mediocre these days. Because women aren't raped nearly enough, aren't beaten nearly enough, don't go hungry and don't cry nearly enough, they've forgotten to appreciate greatness and instead hum along like objects, between a "battery low warning" and a "you've got new messages" notification.<br />
It's no way to live, not for any woman, and a "career" is no substitute, a sex tape is no substitute, nothing can really ever substitute. Grow up, stop clinging to your prepubescent sarafans, go find a great man and give him a great eulogy already.<br />
Online, it's the women that rape.<br />
It's an inconvenient but incontrovertible fact that the "online threat" variety of pseudo-rape is a form of typically feminine communication, employed generally by women.<br />
Patriarchy is a thing because nobody likes living in a world populated by little girls<br />
There you go, the complete story of rape as required life experience. Girl says no fifty times and nobody cares. Itâs not her place to deny.</p>
<p>So, to anyone who thinks he was just trolling or doing this "for the lulz": nope.

<p>Although the techies have managed to convince us that this was not a big deal and I really to not want to stir more drama but there are two points I wish to make about this incident.</p>
<p>1. Douche canoe could have made his point about FetLife security by listing all males who live in Antarctica over the age of 65. He didn't.<sup><a href="#footnote_102_61069" id="identifier_102_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="No, he couldn't have. Think about it.">ciii</a></sup> He chose to target what is the most vulnerable group on FetLife.<sup><a href="#footnote_103_61069" id="identifier_103_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Ironically, women under 30 are the least vulnerable group of all. Think about that, too.">civ</a></sup> Kinky women under the age of 30.</p>
<p>2. The 'cost' of being outed here is not just a difficult conversation with family or employer or an increase in unwanted FetLife traffic. It is possible that the identified group will now be subject to stalking or harassment by predators when outside of FetLife. This list has, perhaps only marginally, nonetheless increased the ability of unsavoury people to identify all kinky women under the age of 30 who live in a specific location (ie a small town).</p>

<p>Seems to me most people are missing the bigger picture. If Ikonoclast is right about how the information was obtained, changing anything in your profile now isn't going to help. It's all linked to your ID number. So at any time a new list could be posted from the original information he got of any age/gender or location he wanted, all linked to the log in ID.<br />
Change all you want now, but what you had posted then is the information he has.</p>
<p><em>fromtheprof: 11 days ago</em></p>
<p>I think this thread starts with a very useful post. It's so easy to criticize the administrators of a social networking site. Frankly, in the social networking realm Fetlife is a breath of fresh air.</p>
<p>Why? Because this site most of all is a "discussion/forum" site with lively discussions like this. If you look outside Fetlife at the social networking world you will find that most discussion boards have been abandoned in favor of sites like Twitter and Facebook where intelligent discussion largely never happens.<sup><a href="#footnote_106_61069" id="identifier_106_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Don't flatter yourself. This `discussion` consists of a handful of sane people (the original poster not included) and two degrees of magnitude more derps shitposting (like you are). This is how `social media` on the broken paradigm works while its small. Should Fetlife ever grow, not to the millions they fraudulently claim but even outside of the five figure ghetto, it'd go down exactly the way it went down for Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Wikipedia et all. 
This necessarily, because the non-WoT social media is like the non-plumbing town : a shitpile.">cvii</a></sup></p>
<p>Facebook is a site about community and community building - something that really has to come back into the social network world in general. Fetlife sets a great example.<sup><a href="#footnote_107_61069" id="identifier_107_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="You're retarded.">cviii</a></sup> That's why this site is so popular<sup><a href="#footnote_108_61069" id="identifier_108_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Very, very  retarded.">cix</a></sup>  - in spite of the fact that the great majority of the population doesn't share our lifestyle so the pool from which Fetlife members are drawn is tiny compared to most other social networking sites.</p>
<p>So - in a site with as many members as this one has, you are going to get a bunch of douchebag assholes. That's just life. Get over it.</p>
<p><em>DeeplyDesired: 11 days ago</em></p>
<p>@BF_Sassy. Agreed.</p>
<p>But it is worthwhile for everybody to go through their profiles and work out how easy it would be to identify the owner (and if you care, of course) and be aware that anybody can access their profile, (including that weird guy who lives down the block and never goes out), inspect the writing, steal the pictures and reverse-search them.</p>

<p>please allow me to say something, and please bear in mind i do find this an abhorrent and vile act and i do not condone this at all. i really am appalled by it.</p>
<p>The act itself is not purely misogynistic. though it is in part at the same time.</p>
<p>when we look at the response at this and how it has brought up discussion again of security fetlife should probably have, it highlights how protective people can be (THANKFULLY!) of the safety of female identified individuals. but one has to wonder if the same reaction would happen if it was towards males. i.e imgur.com/CQ5qgvu<sup><a href="#footnote_109_61069" id="identifier_109_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Nope. Nobody gives a shit about trannies. By the time you have to discuss in terms of `so and so identified` it's time to go die in a fire. Which - you know it's what you want, anyway.">cx</a></sup></p>
<p>again i think it is a stupid fucking thing to do, and it IS largely misogynistic but the flip side also is that people are much more likely to react strongly if the detrimental act is against women.</p>
<p>i do apologize if that sounds offensive and that certainly is not my intention.</p>
<p>point is this act has (though at the cost of peoples safety and privacy that they were more than likely innocently unaware was not as protected as they thought and should be) made a big reaction and has spread a lot of this awareness and may indeed make fl a safer place for all users.</p>

<p>Fetlife might be able to change security settings redesign the site and so on much as facebook is doing it but that wouldn't change anything. As stated a couple of times everything you put on the internet can be found and every site can be hacked; even though that wasnt even the case here.<br />
i truely don't believe fetlife has the proper funds to get this done. I tried to get to this trilema link someone posted bit couldn't open it. probably taken down already (??).<br />
Also the biggest problem for people posting information on fetlife that links them to their real life is (my opinion) that having a kink is still a huge taboo.<br />
In some states/countries it is more accepted you are for the same sex (nothing wrong with that; just comparing!) than when you would claim you love or are turned on by whips/ponyplay/orgy's/pain/... (list is too long ;-) )</p>
<p>Seems best way to protect privacy in this matter is probably just don't post it if it shouldn't be in the open unless you just don't give a f*ck.<br />

<p><em>JayCynic:  11 days ago</em></p>
<p>What I find most disturbing about their site was the use of the term "meat" and the objectification it implied.</p>
<p>What I find most disturbing about the responses is the resort to violence and revenge, which in my view places the proponents on an even lower level than the idiot.</p>
<p>And what makes me sad is that people use terms like "hack" and "outed" as lightheartedly, and have really so little insight into how this Internet thing works, and what it means for information to be machine readable. Anyone could do that.</p>
<p>If I cared, it'd probably take me an hour or two, a day if I wanted to cross-reference likely matching profiles from other sources like OkCupid, more like a week or two if I wanted to link to public Facebook and/or LinkedIn etc profiles. (And that's because I have absolutely no clue on how to do graph analysis, but mix in some facial recognition, and you're done. The code is all out there, it's just a matter of plugging the pieces together.)</p>
<p>Seriously, extracting a sequential list of all matches for a given area is beyond trivial. If that already scares you, you really should run for the hills. The idiot here<sup><a href="#footnote_114_61069" id="identifier_114_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Urmom, buddy!">cxv</a></sup> at least had the basic decency to link to the profiles, so non-members can't follow up or see confidential information.</p>
<p>And yes, of course, @JohnBaku is not without fault here. FL makes many things way too easy; sequential user-ids, etc. I'd not be surprised if there was absolutely no rate limiting or other features to drag such a crawl out<sup><a href="#footnote_115_61069" id="identifier_115_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="There aren't.">cxvi</a></sup> (not that it can be avoided, but if at least some precautions are taken, then it's at least somewhat more believable when someone calls foul).</p>
<p>And while FL is hiring, us supporting members are still waiting for some of those suggestions to be implemented one day when hell freezes over. Privacy and security being just one of them.<sup><a href="#footnote_116_61069" id="identifier_116_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Saying `it's hiring` does not mean it is. It isn't.">cxvii</a></sup></p>
<p>And yes, someone who publicly exposes such a list, calls women "meat", clearly violates the intentions of the women affected and the site itself, clearly is a misogynist bro and an asshole. But please realize that this is trivial to do, and that FL doesn't take any steps to prevent that.</p>
<p>My conclusion, by the way, is not to hide, but to instead work towards a society where "Oh, you're on FL, this idiot said? I told him to mind his own business. So, how's your day, we still on for lunch?" But I realize that not everyone is in a position to do that.</p>
<p><em>Skeptigirl:  11 days ago</em></p>

<p>Automated access is a clear violation of TOU so imho could qualify as hack. Also, for some people their FL nickname is readily traceable to real names or non-kink online media, so posting it publicly is posting personally identifiable data and could be considered outing. That it's easy to do doesn't make it less so.<br />
My conclusion, by the way, is not to hide, but to instead work towards a society where "Oh, you're on FL, this idiot said? I told him to mind his own business. So, how's your day, we still on for lunch?" But I realize that not everyone is in a position to do that.</p>
<p>Agreed. But the broader issue is that if this jackass had stolen more data, FL had become searchable, which had broken the very thing that makes FL good. It would have ruined FL in the long run.</p>

<p>The problem is FL structurally spends its money on making Fetlife cooler instead of safer. We've had new features aplenty, but some huge security gaps haven't been fixed for six years or longer. Not fixing security but implementing chat, new feed stuff and inbox version 4 or so is a choice.</p>
<p>I do think more people should be paying for FL, but as a lifetime supporter I'm not willing to pay more at the moment and I wouldn't bet my ass extra money would indeed go towards safety.</p>

What if the omnipotent creators of this site posted the $$ needed to code true security on the site - @bringit</p>
<p>Then they would build a site nobody would use.</p>
<p>Do you share pictures with your friends exclusively over Textsecure or Silent Chat? Do you shop at online stores that only accept Bitcoin? Thought not. Because you use practical services instead.</p>
<p>Picture a Fetlife that solves the "issues" everyone here is talking about. You're at a munch. You meet someone you like. They give you their Fetlife account name. You come to Fetlife, and try to add them as a friend, but can't. You can't even look at profile content they wanted to make public.</p>
<p>Because in Trilema's "easily secured" world, that person has to first obtain a 20 digit hash from you, and you theirs. Account names can be leaked remember. And you can't just send a "friend request", you sit back and wait until you both happen to key in each other's hash, at which point the system confirms you've "consented" and you become friends.</p>
<p>You want this friend to see a photo. You try to upload one, but photos on the Internet can be copied, so Fetlife helpfully denies your ability to do so.</p>
<p>You try to add fetish of yours. It's niche, and you've never heard of anyone being into it. But somehow, Fetlife manages to find a thousand people you can share your desire with. Except you can't. Because you add the fetish, and Fetlife won't let you see who shares that fetish. Otherwise it would be a "leak".</p>
<p>Noone gets upset about security on sites like Adult Matchmaker. Not only would this exact same thing work there, but your profiles there contain a postcode, which can be very precisely searched. And, unlike Fetlife, they are almost always completely accurate regarding sex and location. About all that's different is that it's easier to get upset at John than a faceless organisation.<sup><a href="#footnote_118_61069" id="identifier_118_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Poisonous BS, but so amply addressed already, on Trilema and other places, and so clearly the guy has read all that (by the way he tiptoes around it) that I shan't bother with a rehash here.">cxix</a></sup></p>

<p>I think the onus should be on the individual. it is down to You to protect your selves. You are an adult. You don't have to post those pictures, your name or your actual location. Be smarter. This is an electronic age, are people really this blind? Like omg somebody wrote a little program and got information about me? Please, advertising companies have been selling your information for years.</p>

<p>Honestly, such things are probably a good thing in the long run...people might start to think a little more about their internet presence. It really isn't hard to find all the information a person could want on anyone they want just from publicly available sources. This is why googling yourself is a good idea, both your name and your screen names, see how hard it is for you to connect the two. That is about as hard as it is for anyone else to do the same. Anything you post online is available to everyone and anyone that wants that information. If you don't want people to know, then don't post it online. If you can find it and don't want people to, delete it, and then feel silly cause the info is still on the web. Once your on the grid, it is really hard to get off of it, and really lonely once you do.</p>

<p>I still consider it a form of outing. Why? Because to view any of this information. you have to already have an account. That is how you are meant to find these. but a list? Only the young females? It gives age. gender, and location. That alone married it down. Many people can be recognized in a small group just by tiny identifiers. You don't pick something you hate to identify yourself, after all. MyLittleTardis along with age. gender. and location can tell friends, family, or often random Facebook friends all they need to know to know it's you. Many people here reuse screen names, so now they can be harassed elsewhere. No, this jerk didn't tell your friends and family, but he still posted information that was supposed to be sealed to outsiders. Yes, Fetlife needs to fix these holes. But to prove a point he could have ONLY used his friends top do so. Also, he called us all meat. That's a bigreason arwe're all pissed.</p>

<p>I really appreciate this post. I think it's important not to take posts like these as indications that people who don't deliberately protect themselves "deserve" to have others do bad things to them (and likewise I hope that's not the spirit this post was written in, though I didn't read it that way).<sup><a href="#footnote_124_61069" id="identifier_124_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="That is exactly what it is. Either you use your hands like a human or you are a chimp. Either you are savvy or you are meat. Don't like being a black slave in the slave owning South ? Be a yankee then. The onus is on you, forever so.">cxxv</a></sup> That would be like when assholes tell women not to dress a certain way if they don't want to get assaulted. Nonetheless, knowledge is power, and it's important to understand what is/isn't actually happening in this situation. And, by extension, then I think it becomes clearer how right now the onus is upon us as individual users but it doesn't have to be, not to the degree it currently is. I just voted for a feature on FL's suggestion pageâ to create selective privacy tiers on our accountsâ and I strongly suggest that others do the same. It's frankly unconscionable for FL's developers to not have tackled this issue yet.</p>

<p>Good article, but it misses one important point. One key advantage of FL is that it is not "google-indexed." That means, for example, if I type in my screenname into Google, I won't see any hits from FL.</p>
<p>By moving profile information outside of FL, it becomes google-searchable. Depending on whether you practice good information hygiene or not, that might or might not be a problem. If you use the same picture on both FL and FB, you should consider changing one of them.</p>
<p>At a minimum, FL can and should disable accounts that host automated crawls (an ordinary user will not need to view millions of profiles!). That will fix the immediate problem.<sup><a href="#footnote_125_61069" id="identifier_125_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="If cows were spherical and lived in a vacuum.">cxxvi</a></sup></p>

<p>@DrStabby<br />
AdultFriendFinder is a dating site (although it's more a sort of subset of dating, a find a sex partner site). That's why people can search by sex, location, what the person is looking for, etc. It wouldn't work otherwise. If someone wants to find someone of the right sex within so many miles who is looking for someone like him or her, they can find those people. If they couldn't, the site would be useless. The nature of its purpose makes those kinds of searches a requirement.</p>
<p>That's not the case here. People (most of them) are not looking for a sex partner. Lots of people aren't even looking for a BDSM partner. In many ways it's an information sharing site, people talk with people they'll never meet about BDSM topics. It only way it goes farther than that is if someone decides to join a group that's local to them which has parties and such.</p>
<p>And someone looking for people of a certain sex, of a certain age, within a certain area, are almost certainly looking for sex. Since that's NOT why most people are on here, they understandably don't want to be bothered with emails or friend requests from people who are trying to hook up. That having been said, though, emails and friend requests from people wanting something you aren't particularly interested in is the worst thing that will happen to anyone as a result of the asshole's "meat list". Nobody is going to get anyone's real name, address, or even cell number from it.</p>
<p>As far as disrespecting women, those over 30 in one way and those under 30 in another way, ultimately, so what? This clown obviously sees women in the way that he sees him, there's no realistic way to change his attitude, and why even care about what someone like that thinks?<sup><a href="#footnote_126_61069" id="identifier_126_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Not to mention the impression is mutual. I don't happen to care what a bunch of pointless derps like or don't like either.">cxxvii</a></sup> And I don't see his attitude leading to the creation of more men who see women as pieces of meat. Men who already think that way will continue to do so, and men with at least two brain cells to rub together won't change their attitude because of his silly little lists.</p>
<p>Since someone pulled his data, we know he's from Romania and the sad fact is that the men in the societies in that part of the world, as a group (although not necessarily as individuals - every society has people who don't follow the group), do have a male-centric, very paternalistic, and misogynistic attitude.<sup><a href="#footnote_127_61069" id="identifier_127_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Those societies have also survived more than the US ever will. The two are not unrelated. Female-centric societies collapse, male-centric societies endure.">cxxviii</a></sup> The only thing that will ever change that is time. About 60 years ago the general culture in America had the same attitude<sup><a href="#footnote_128_61069" id="identifier_128_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="And back then `America` was actually a thing, and the US actually mattered.">cxxix</a></sup>, even if we were maybe more polite about it. Now the people here with that viewpoint that used to be in the vast majority are in the minority. With Romania having emerged from about a century of isolation and super authoritarian rule, ans becoming engaged with the modern world, I expect things will change there just as they did here.</p>
<p>But what will change it is time, not stressing about the attitude of one complete fucktard, who right now is nothing more than a reflection of the society he grew in and was socialized by.<sup><a href="#footnote_129_61069" id="identifier_129_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Perhaps it will rot like the West, yes. Or perhaps it will survive once more. Romania was around, and Romanians spoke Romanian at a time the Golden Horde was a thing and America hadn't been invented yet. There's perhaps some hope that the current Orc Horde of SJWing and assorted derpage will pass too, unknown, into forgotten, dusty history, like the mongol[oids] that they are.">cxxx</a></sup></p>

<p>"Why is this not really a security breach? Because any idiot could do it, and once again the information is not really protected - a real security breach involves accessing data you're not supposed to be able to access, i.e. passwords or email addresses."</p>
<p>This argument isn't valid, even if the conclusion is. Suppose a site has a failure of access control (that is, a failure relative to the controls that are believed to be in place), that "any idiot" could exploit. Does the fact that the flaw is publicly exploitable have any bearing on whether we consider it a security breach? No.</p>
<p>FetLife's implementation of image links, for example, has a security flaw because a user of the site would not reasonably expect that an image will be publicly linkable in a way that allows it to be accessed by people who are not their friends logged into FetLife. (Yes, the image could be copied, and you need to be a friend to get the URL in the first place, but it's making linking easier in a way that users don't expect.)</p>
<p>I agree about the more serious problems listed at the end of the post.</p>

<p>@ _daira_ - this "security flaw" that you are talking about in relation to linking images is raised often as an attack on Fetlife. You're not even the first person to raise it on this thread.</p>
<p>The same exact "vulnerability" exists in private Facebook galleries, private Instagram galleries, private Photobucket accounts, private Flickr galleries, even pictures you messaged directly to someone privately on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter.</p>
<p>I am also aware of a Government service that provides healthcare related data in this fashion.</p>
<p>It's time to stop bagging Fetlife over this. There are valid arguments to certain privacy controls. This isn't one of them.<sup><a href="#footnote_130_61069" id="identifier_130_61069" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Everyone shitting in the soup doesn't make shitsoup hygienic.">cxxxi</a></sup></p>

<p>To my fortune, I do not need to worry about being outed. I am already out to anyone who matters to me and anyone else knowing is just one less person I need to censor myself around. I already operate under the idea that nothing is truly private, and as such don't post things that I would not want found.</p>
<p>I also understand that the changes that I have made to my profiles are not going to 100% prevent the things that I do worry about. Such as being located in real time and stalked. I do hope that it would make things inconvenient enough that the less motivated would become easily deterred. (which in my opinion, if they are using someone elses "meat list" then they are probably lazy enough that easy targets are all they are interested in.)</p>
<p>All I can say is protect your identity if you are worried about it. Protect your safety if you are worried about it. But bitching on a post and doing nothing, expecting someone else to protect your privacy is asinine. Don't join a website on a machine that is never truely secure and expect someone else to wipe your ass behind you because you drunk posted something. Deciding that your life will be absolutely burned to the ground if you are outed and then posting identifiable information is also a stupid move.</p>

						<blockquote><p>xcvi. It's also natural. Grow up.</p></blockquote>
<p>Didn't you mention something in the logs about 'being natural offering little ethical indication' ? </p>
<p>So if natural behaviour isn't necessarily ethical, is ethical behaviour the honest, trustworthy, and upstanding subset of natural behaviour ? </p>
<p>I admit I can't conceive of a behaviour that would be exterior to either classification...</p>

						<p><a href=http://btcbase.org/log//?date=22-04-2015#1106145 >Here</a>. While it's true that something being natural offers little ethical indication, it seemed to me that the explicitly unsupported statement was being implicitly supported by a claim to un-natural-ness. That removed, it has exactly nothing to stand on. So women gotta deal with being women. Great. Rocks gotta deal with there being an atmosphere, what of it ? The atmosphere actually is. "Oh but what if there weren't..." ?</p>

						<p>Not necessarily... it's just... I don't know, man, you're within something like 1:60 of wikipedia, and you just don't seem to give a shit. I'm sure there's not 60 people working over there, and I'm sure each and every single one of the countless wiki editors, admins, superderpins and everything else would shit their pants, set their pet cat farm on fire and drown in their own jizz if they were anywhere near 1% of your exposure.<br />

						<p>I just never realised anyone gives a shit about wikipedia. I get it, they're the monopolistic, one-and-only-google-approved PBN, but... whatever, who cares ? Why would they ? I suppose it's the favourite copy-paste source for inept middleschoolers "writing" "essays" for their equally inept social workers, but I'm neither twelve years old nor stuck in Wichita. Besides unintentionally comedic content is it known for anything ?</p>

						<p>Actually <a href="https://archive.is/wip/VchIx">by their own reporting</a> wikipedia is belaboring under 41000 "active editors". No idea why not an exact figure, but if it means something like "made one edit this month" and the usual 1% rule of internet activity applies, there's a few hundred people actually involved to something like a degree, let's say between a job and a hobby. Still an order of magnitude larger than the factor of 60 you're discussing, but I think three or four orders of magnitude smaller than what <a href="http://trilema.com/2016/the-herd-of-independent-minds-or-has-the-avantgarde-its-own-mass-culture/?b=laws%20that&amp;e=false#select">most people imagine</a> is involved. Just like with <a href="http://trilema.com/2018/fetlikeslol/?b=not%20exactly%20&amp;e=s%20to#select">everything</a> <a href="http://trilema.com/2016/kismia-dating-scam/">else</a>.</p>

						<p>The difference between 5 edits/month and 3 edits/day was about a degree of magnitude <a href="https://archive.is/DzKRh">back in 2019</a>, with 1/3 being admins and 1/10 being bots. This is about half of the peak back in 2007, arguably the last time anyone took it seriously.</p>

						<p>2007, huh. That's truly a long-ass time ago.</p>
<p>But yeah, if it weren't for the Alphabet state agency and its utterly desperate need for something, anything, no matter how flimsy or discreditable to prop its completely imaginary "market" valuation with... the plug'd have long ago been pulled on this shambling zombie of a "social phenomenon" -- much like it was in fact pulled on "OWS" or whatever <a href="http://trilema.com/2017/in-case-you-were-wondering-where-all-the-worthless-nuland-drones-ended-up/">Nulandism</a>s.
