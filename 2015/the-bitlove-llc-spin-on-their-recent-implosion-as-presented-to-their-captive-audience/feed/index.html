		<description>[...] There's no beating wikipedia for the resolving of conundrums in the vein of which fictitious existence "played the part" of which "other", equally fictious existence in whichever "particular" (sike, they're all the same) soap opera (though I think they call it "daytime drama" now) ? (Intel points out that the expert died recently , so even this limited utility might soon vanish.) [...]</description>

		<description>2007, huh. That's truly a long-ass time ago.

But yeah, if it weren't for the Alphabet state agency and its utterly desperate need for something, anything, no matter how flimsy or discreditable to prop its completely imaginary "market" valuation with... the plug'd have long ago been pulled on this shambling zombie of a "social phenomenon" -- much like it was in fact pulled on "OWS" or whatever &lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2017/in-case-you-were-wondering-where-all-the-worthless-nuland-drones-ended-up/"&gt;Nulandism&lt;/a&gt;s. How anyone's supposed to buy into this absurdist rigamarole whereby "google is worth a trillion dollars because it links wikipedia pages" is anyone's guess.</description>

		<description>The difference between 5 edits/month and 3 edits/day was about a degree of magnitude &lt;a href="https://archive.is/DzKRh"&gt;back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, with 1/3 being admins and 1/10 being bots. This is about half of the peak back in 2007, arguably the last time anyone took it seriously.</description>

		<description>Actually &lt;a href="https://archive.is/wip/VchIx"&gt;by their own reporting&lt;/a&gt; wikipedia is belaboring under 41000 "active editors". No idea why not an exact figure, but if it means something like "made one edit this month" and the usual 1% rule of internet activity applies, there's a few hundred people actually involved to something like a degree, let's say between a job and a hobby. Still an order of magnitude larger than the factor of 60 you're discussing, but I think three or four orders of magnitude smaller than what &lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2016/the-herd-of-independent-minds-or-has-the-avantgarde-its-own-mass-culture/?b=laws%20that&#38;e=false#select"&gt;most people imagine&lt;/a&gt; is involved. Just like with &lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2018/fetlikeslol/?b=not%20exactly%20&#38;e=s%20to#select"&gt;everything&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2016/kismia-dating-scam/"&gt;else&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

		<description>I just never realised anyone gives a shit about wikipedia. I get it, they're the monopolistic, one-and-only-google-approved PBN, but... whatever, who cares ? Why would they ? I suppose it's the favourite copy-paste source for inept middleschoolers "writing" "essays" for their equally inept social workers, but I'm neither twelve years old nor stuck in Wichita. Besides unintentionally comedic content is it known for anything ?</description>
