		<description>[...] Yet the distinguished gentleman stays distinguished, and the lowlife ass-in-trade stays in trade. The year is 1972, and the world is still, to some diminished degree but still functioning, because this is the only point that ultimately matters : the absolutely only reason a bureaucracy might be tolerated in this world is if it manages to maintain the distinguished gentleman's social priviledge at lower comparative cost. That's the necessary value proposition for a state to exist to any degree in the first place (and through its existence offer a safe heaven for all the ambitious but worthless nobodies making up "the machinery"). Absent delivery of that only relevant social good, there's no further need of it, at all, altogether. I don't mean something vague and lax, like "there's no further need of panda bears [but they may continue existing at their leisure and as best they manage]". I mean something quite strict and definitive, like "there's no further need of horse-drawn ploughs, hence you can't really find any", so kiss all those creature comforts you now enjoy one last hearty goodbye -- there's no "european commission" or "senate" or anything else in that vein keeping you in food and clothing if you don't deliver the only thing you're here to deliver.
