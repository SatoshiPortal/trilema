<p>So prepared, let us proceed to the famous "cunts run Perl" discussion.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Perhaps you don't appreciate how deep Perl goes, or how unaware Perl-people are of their Perl-ness.<br />
<strong>gabriel_laddel</strong> Fuck em? I mean literally - steal their Bitcoin, hack their bank accounts, cause chaos.<br />
<strong>asciilifeform</strong> 'Certain languages support serious programmers, and others don't.  E.g., I don't think it is at all possible to become a serious programmer using Visual Basic or Perl.  If you think hard about what Perl code will do on the borders of the known input space, your head will explode.  If you write Perl code to handle input problems gracefully, your programs will become gargantuan: the normal failure mode is to terminate with no idea how far into the process you got or how much of an incomplete task was actually performed.  On my view, serious programmers don't deal with tools that _force_ them to hope everything works.' -- herr Naggum, who else.<br />
<strong>trinque</strong> Lotta derps out there that can be taught to better themselves. I'm fucking 28 and learning CL *now*</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> I think the female reproductive system runs on Perl. What now ?<sup><a href="#footnote_0_61199" id="identifier_0_61199" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Yes, this was the conversational bomb of all time.">i</a></sup></p>
<p>[*crickets*]</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> I see nobody wishes to engage the cunt problem. But yes, IT DOES RUN ON PERL. And here we are.<br />
<strong>gabriel_laddel</strong> In what sense? That it'll accept all sorts of odd inputs?<sup><a href="#footnote_1_61199" id="identifier_1_61199" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="To quote Marius : `The next morning,we walked over the hill toward Lut Gholein. I had no idea then... of the horrors that were in store for me there.`">ii</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> How familiar with the process are you ? Like, for instance, the simple (lol<sup><a href="#footnote_2_61199" id="identifier_2_61199" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="It is only simple in the sense PHP is self-explanatory.">iii</a></sup>) ShouldAbort() function ?<br />
<strong>gabriel_laddel</strong> I've had sex with a female if that's what you're asking.</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Not at all. Think about it : foetuses are sometimes aborted. On the basis of reasons. When ? Why ? Pure Perl.<br />
*	asciilifeform tries to picture a variant where 'where, why' is accessible.</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> It is, you can measure a lot about a pregnancy.<br />
<strong>asciilifeform</strong> - with instruments. Sure, fella with microscope can sometimes say why eject button got pressed. But that isn't negating the 'perliness' of the basic apparatus, no ?<br />
<strong>gabriel_laddel</strong> You're talking about the women in question purposefully aborting her pregnancy? Or miscarriage?</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> No, no, we're talking about the reproductive system itself.<sup><a href="#footnote_3_61199" id="identifier_3_61199" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Technically, spontaneous abortion (failure of the foetus) and miscarriage (failure of the womb) are different things, but this may be too pointed a distinction for the context.">iv</a></sup> Trisomies are usually aborted. Spina bifida usually not. Etc. Make sense of it, Nobel prize is yours.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel_laddel</strong> Yeah, I don't see the analogy to Perl.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Really ?!</p>
<p><strong>trinque</strong> That nature is filthy hacks upon hacks?<br />
<strong>asciilifeform</strong> Pretty sure the example you cited is immunological (trisomies trigger tumour response). </p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Maybe. Some of them certainly do. IIRC they proved some of them actually abort through some oxygenation pathway.<br />
<strong>gabriel_laddel</strong> The reason we build abstract machines is because people are not very good at repetitive tasks.</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> This is cells. Cells are automatons.<br />
<strong>gabriel_laddel</strong> Yes...?</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Humans don't enter into it, at that level. And it's Perl for exactly the specified reason, "the normal failure mode is to terminate with no idea how far into the process you got or how much of an incomplete task was actually performed". Many more similarities (like a pointed lack of sexprs<sup><a href="#footnote_4_61199" id="identifier_4_61199" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="If the coincidence that S-expressions abbreviate into this particular double-entendre is not definitive proof God is laughing at you...">v</a></sup>), but let's keep it simple.<br />
<strong>gabriel_laddel</strong> People are machines - but computer programs are not people, nor cells. We know how to write computer programs such that you don't need regexes. If you're /ever/ using them, you're doing it wrong.</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> So you're saying cunts are doing it wrong.<br />
<strong>asciilifeform</strong> Basic idea, perhaps, is that systems designed 'step at a time' by 'practical types' without any clear line of reason - will converge to resemble meat. As per <A href=http://trilema.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/future-of-computing.pdf>L. Lamport's essay</a>.</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> No, idea is that some people who can't even make <a href=http://trilema.com/2014/the-complexity-of-life-a-triad/>dragonfly</a> are in a weak position to teach grandmother how to suck eggs, as it were.<br />
<strong>asciilifeform</strong> If we get the stochasticity of meat, we also need to have the wide functional state space of meat. One without the other - is drowning in shit.</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> That may be. I'm just pointing out that biology offers a very significant challenge to theoretical CS, in the perl aspect of things.<br />
<strong>gabriel_laddel</strong> This conversation bothers me. </p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Does it ?<br />
<strong>gabriel_laddel</strong> We don't understand how to make dragonflies, nor how the reproductive system works. We know how to write computer programs that work - the failing to do the latter correctly is a human failing. Analogy need not enter into the conversation. It isn't necessary.</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Generally when an analogy need not enter into a conversation, it's a sign the conversation's broken.<br />
<strong>gabriel_laddel</strong> Der fucking nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> And mind you, at issue is not whether we do or don't understand how reproduction works. At issue is that we understand enough to know it runs on Perl. Which means that as long as you live, you will not live in a clean world.<br />
<strong>gabriel_laddel</strong> It doesn't run on "Perl". "Perl" is a well specified computer program. Meat runs another separate well specified meat program. Select portions of humanity have, to varying degrees created "clean" computing.</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Take the simple fact that ethacridine lactate induces abortion in any trimester, and without exception. If this isn't a regex gone wrong, what is ? (And if it were so well specified, we'd prolly know a lot more of it than we do.)<br />
<strong>gabriel_laddel</strong> Regexes are regexes - nothing elese is. Not everything is the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> So you dispute that there's ready biologic equivalents of a regexp match ? You are aware organic molecules are actual strings.<br />
<strong>gabriel_laddel</strong> I wouldn't dare draw that equivalence without agreeing on a formal definition for regexes and the process in question.</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> How do you define a string ? (This, incidentally, would be the Lisp/Perl difference IMO. Lisp does not have strings, Perl does not have sexprs. In spite of pretending on each side.)<br />
<strong>gabriel_laddel</strong> WTF is this. Lisp doesn't have strings?</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> If you think about it, you said so yourself. "If you're /ever/ using them, you're doing it wrong."<br />
<strong>gabriel_laddel</strong> My first pass at a definition for a string: A string is a collection of characters from an alphabet.</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Organic molecules pass this.<br />
<strong>gabriel_laddel</strong> Nah - if you're using regexes you're doing it wrong.</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> That's what strings are. "Stuff you use regexps on".<br />
<strong>gabriel_laddel</strong> Nonsense. I use strings all the time, don't use regexes.</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> You're using fake Lisp strings. Perl people think they're using "structured data" too. It's all strings, but w/e.<br />
<strong>gabriel_laddel</strong> They can't do tree traversals on their "structured data"</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Exactly.<br />
<strong>gabriel_laddel</strong> Therefore they suck c0cks.</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> And you can't do regexp on your "Strings". Therefore...<br />
<strong>gabriel_laddel</strong> Ah, but I can.</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Well, "can".<br />
<strong>gabriel_laddel</strong> I don't because it's stupid.</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Right. Why do you think THEY don't ?<br />
<strong>gabriel_laddel</strong> Because they're mentally defective.</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Obviously.<br />
<strong>gabriel_laddel</strong> (I'm assuming you're saying "why don't you think they don't - do tree traversals")<sup><a href="#footnote_5_61199" id="identifier_5_61199" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The fact that he correctly followed the implicit symbol there pleads muchly in favour of his intelligence. The discussion is very complex, layers are numerous, the emotional temperature is high - exactly the sort of situation where lesser intellects drop the reference count and start garbage-collecting the kernel space.">vi</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Right.<br />
<strong>gabriel_laddel</strong> I should note that "they" (Algol programmers) try to add the tree traversal properties of Lisp to their languages. In every single language. They all have failed, and will continue to fail</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> So ?<br />
<strong>gabriel_laddel</strong> So they waste a lot of effort doing it.</p>
<p>*	mircea_popescu gets a "so ?" gold-on-black-cardboard card.<sup><a href="#footnote_6_61199" id="identifier_6_61199" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="He's exhausted and heading for familiar terrain because wtf is this shit already!">vii</a></sup><br />
<strong>decimation</strong> Did I just stumble into an ongoing turing test?<sup><a href="#footnote_7_61199" id="identifier_7_61199" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I doubt anyone was prepared for the MP cavalrly charge straight out of left field in a conversation that has been had repeatedly to the point of ritual by generations of systems and otherwise engineers. I did commit the equivalent of showing up with a flamethrower at a figure skating competition, `what move is that! IT LITERALLY MELTED THE ICE!11`">viii</a></sup><br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Nah, i'm just being unreasonably heterodox over here.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel_laddel</strong> This conversation is going in the direction of "heat death of the universe" so I'll note that companies that use e.g., Scala have to hire a lot of people to regin in the complexity inherrent in ALGOL. Hence, they waste money. Hence they'll be beaten in the marketplace by yours truly.<sup><a href="#footnote_8_61199" id="identifier_8_61199" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Here's me wishing him best of luck with it!">ix</a></sup><br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> This is a very minor point. The chief point, still standing, is that cunts still run on Perl. There must be a reason for this. But even if there isn't a reason for this : it's so deeply baked into the structure of the world, you'll never be free of it. (Because cunts obviously aren't free to choose what they use, so the need for Perl must be way deeper than that.)<sup><a href="#footnote_9_61199" id="identifier_9_61199" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Think about it : the space of possibilities for system engineering of sexuate reproduction is very well explored in practice.">x</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>gabriel_laddel</strong> And...?<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> That's all, no more. You'll never be entirely free of idiots.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel_laddel</strong> That doesn't mean I should stop "butchering slugs".<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Hey, splay that slit! no argument here.</p>
<p><strong>decimation</strong> How can anyone even make statements about what the female reproductive/baby system is doing without examining the results in each case, in molecular detail?<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> [It's been examined] enough to say "it's doing regexp".</p>
<p><strong>gabriel_laddel</strong> What aesthetic do you wish to live in?<br />
<strong>trinque</strong> Fast and loose is fine if the product is somewhat disposable?<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Except the product of reproduction is perhaps the most expensive thing there is, if you look in the proper context.</p>
<p><strong>trinque</strong> Yes, very expensive to the host body while it's being made<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>trinque</strong> Seems like systems where there are a variety of ways to solve problems accept that they don't know the "perfect" way, if there is one. Assuming lack of perfect knowledge having multiple things to try seems appropriate<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> The main problem here is that for a large number of solid considerations, Lisp would actually be a much better choice. Moreover, the space alf referred to is indeed vast, but the processes narrow. In many spots the whole tree converges to a very very narrow bottleneck. Consider the ridiculous happenstance that all foeti have a god damned lizard tail two weeks in.</p>
<p><strong>trinque</strong> Mhm, and gills at some point, or proto-gills. Little blockchains themselves.<br />
<strong>asciilifeform</strong> I must confess, that I am at a loss as to which aspects of meat we should like to replicate in machines: intransigence? toe fungus? pneumonia? schizophrenia? Seems like we've achieved a great many of these, in the computer...<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> I wasn't going nearly as far as any of that. Anyway I should like to see a schizo computer.<sup><a href="#footnote_10_61199" id="identifier_10_61199" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="If you recall the Eliza stuff...">xi</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>asciilifeform</strong> "there must be a reason for this." << same reason eagle doesn't have jet with afterburner in his arse.<br />
<strong>trinque</strong> I wonder if we'd have done the one with the afterburner having never seen a bird.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Nah, it's not energetically efficient. Try and power the jet off the bird's diet.<sup><a href="#footnote_11_61199" id="identifier_11_61199" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Really, the extremely cheap, stable and concentrated energy soup that's gasoline has spoiled engineers. Go spend some time contemplating just how improbable the thing is, gaze upon its outlier characteristics and wonder.">xii</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>asciilifeform</strong> "it's so deeply baked into the structure of the world, you'll never be free of it." << Johnson noise, shot noise, etc. are intrinsic to electrical circuit. Yet we have to sweat and build whole other box to get PC to cough up random bits. Because designers did practically nuke the analogue soup. (Yes, RAM failures, etc. exist.)<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> I have no doubt you have still hope, alf :)</p>
<p><strong>trinque</strong> mircea_popescu: Right, so we're talking about the difference between systems which try to be general solutions to (not sure how to articulate it) vs specific tools which live in a given niche? Tools vs general meta-tools or something.<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> I'm not even sure.</p>
<p><strong>asciilifeform</strong> I just can't help but recall Kreinin's piece re: how folks who are asking for meat-like architecture 'whether they want a tool, or electronic best friend or sex partner' and asked whether 'they had tried the selection of naturally-occurring ones first'<br />
<strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Mind that I am not proposing any change here. I am merely pointing out that the Perl-bashing has some serious problems in front of it.</p>
<p><strong>asciilifeform</strong> Nature's criterion of 'works' and mine, I will say, are not at all alike. I don't want to buy the office chair that is successful in cheaply making infinite copies of itself into the aeons. Not unless it also parks my arse well. One observation of mine is that the abstraction that most determines the shape of a program is the unavailable one(s). Think this way - if the problem were entirely contained in an -available- set of abstractions of the language, the program would not need to be written! (Best program is no program.)<br />
<strong>gabriel_laddel</strong> While we're here, I'll note that being tied to text (perl) is quite limiting. On CLIM today I can tell any object how to "present" itself, i.e., how to draw itself on the screen. Such a thing is unthinkable in a language based around regexes.<br />
<strong>asciilifeform</strong> It is a mistake to describe Perl as 'based on' anything in particular. It is soup, consisting of the entire contents of a crashed delivery van. Soup reflective of what is to be found in the author's skullcase. This appeals to some people for a variety of reasons. Partly because it makes a convincing simulacrum of problem-solving, as (per Naggum) Hollywood special effects 'may as well be the real thing'. Partly because it allows imbeciles to feel as if they are 'sticking the finger' to those boring 'squares' who actually take the time to think things through. Partly because Perl proggies tend to be 'throw-aways' and absolve the author of the burden of actually carrying anything through to completion or (horror) supporting. But also for many other reasons, which i will not waste readers' time on.</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Nature's cheaper. You might not get a voice.<br />
<strong>asciilifeform</strong> In the end, the amoeba get the voice.</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> That's the thing.<br />
<strong>asciilifeform</strong> But engineers who take an intense interest in 'in the end' tend to build autoguillotines. Rather than computers.</p>
<p><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Maybe.</p></blockquote>
<p>To make things really unpleasant to my friends (as <a href="http://trilema.com/2014/pushing-the-soft-tender-flesh-of-a-friend-against-the-sharp-rotating-blades-of-the-immutable-machine/">per tradition</a>) : the conversation above is directly homologuous to the following, shorter, simpler, scarier horror : </p>
<blockquote><p>A : The problem with welfarism is that for all its theoretical benefits and superiorities, it's not how molecules work.<sup><a href="#footnote_12_61199" id="identifier_12_61199" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Molecules are utterly capitalist, with energy serving the role of capital.">xiii</a></sup><br />
B : This conversation really bothers me. We have such good discussion of said benefits and superiorities! Let's rehash that instead!<br />
C : Maybe it's different at that low a level ? [Maybe it is. Why would it be ?]<br />
D : If you spend your time thinking about this you'll eventually go hang yourself.</p>
<p>A : Nevertheless.
</p></blockquote>
