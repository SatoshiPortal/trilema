		<description>[...] An increase in temperature does not produce increases in comparative intensity of motion, but on the contrary! It produces a decrease in the intensity of apparent motion relative to the intensity of Brownian motion. This is another aspect of the ever marching thermic death of the universe : the further away you get from 0 Kelvin the less excitable everything gets, "majesty of nature" y compris, eventually leading you to prefer a whole new world to the farted up old one. Just like irl. [...]</description>

		<description>Mary Popescu got into the truck. It was a Ford F-150 running on biodiesel. She was going to meet the Master in Evansville, IN.

She thought about her recent transgender surgery. The Master had suggested it to hanbot who was a F2M transexual and her pimp, after the Master had mindfucked her who was actually a him now into submission.

The Master was a professional video gamer and rapper who hung out with Richard Kulisz and Stanislav Datsokgivsky or whatever the fuck. They had a great time teaching the NSA to mindrape the Trumps. They had gone to the Holocaust Museum to learn how to MKultra the Kennedy descendants into creating meme gifs of tesselated swastikas morphing into Stars of David fractalizing for their class in Terrorist Meme Propaganda 101 taught by the Master.

Then they went to a Michael Jackson museum for educational purposes to learn about vitiligo and skin bleaching treatment, like Vybz Kartel trying to bleach his skin.

Mary Popescu put in Vybz Kartel Wah Some Grades

on the CD player. The Master had telepathically using technology from DARPA mind raped Mary Popescu into submission and suggested that Mary Popescu play Nogatco - Live Dissection instead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdBqOPOy1_o

The Master had big plans to go to Africa. He was going to ride a Saturn V rocket designed by SJW's at Nasa and Stanislav's peers who wanted to turn Africa into the movie Avatar by James Cameron by putting nanosize computer technology in nigger's heads. Suddenly Mary Popescu heard a voice in her head. It was a strong Black voice, like what she imagined the master to sound like. It said, "Remember, all of these moments will be lost in time, like tears in the rain. Time to quit posting."

After a few seconds, Mary Popescu's ADHD caused her to forget what the Master said. But she did remember that she had some pharmaceutical meth to take she was Not Addicted to. She took the pill and felt better. Then she forgot. A thought came into her head, "Fuck you slavemaster ass nigga!" Then she went on in the F-150 entourage with Harley motorcycles around it. The weather was hot and she was sweaty. There were turtles on the ground.</description>
