<p>Everything started one fine Saturday early afternoon, with</p>

<p>A couple of days after the above, the Right Honorable <a href="http://cascadianhacker.com/">Lord Vulpes</a> proposed the bot run Lisp. To everyone's excitement I made no protest, and so the great hope was born. In His Lordship's the Master of the Rolls's own words, </p>
<blockquote><p><strong><a href=" http://trinque.org/">trinque</a></strong> will not be surprised if mircea_popescu ends up writing the ~actual AI apocalypse, now infected with the parentheses</p></blockquote>

<b>ben_vulpes</b> lmk, i can get it in there whenever</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> yeh ima fuck a little with lisp now.<br />
<b>phf</b> ben_vulpes: why the defpackage/in-package prelude?<br />
<b>ben_vulpes</b> i wanted to ensure that `brain' got into the declaimed function definition in the mpbot package</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> ben_vulpes are you available to do "natural language to lisp" translation for me or should i just stfu and read a book ?<br />

<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> aha!<br />
<b>ben_vulpes</b> nil says "return the string instead of writing it to lisp image stdout"</p>

<p><b>phf</b> o_o<br />
<b>ben_vulpes</b> i know, i feel gross. what'd be better?</p>
<p><b>phf</b> read-from-string to get the sexp. you wrap that in a handler to catch syntax etc. issues, then eval.<br />
<b>ben_vulpes</b> aaah</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> is rather grateful to phf<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> kickass scheme we got here, 3 layer deep.<br />
<b>ben_vulpes</b> managing linux eigenstates wasn't even that bad with v in the loop<br />

<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> ben_vulpes so i can't just replace quoted string with (format nil "you too ~A" target) ; why not ?<br />

<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> no, i want sentence "one two three" to become (one  ( (two, three), two (three)) so that sentence(one) = "two, three" and sentence(one(two)) = "three"<br />

<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> and similarily for two etc.<br />

<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> i thought lisp was instantaneous. isn't that what repl means ? too quick to reply ?<br />
<b>ben_vulpes</b> get outta heah</p>
<p><b>ben_vulpes</b> phf: is there a tree-construction approach to this that doesn't boil down to ruby style dicts with string keys?<br />
<b>phf</b> assocs?<br />
<b>phf</b> i restarted the client, and i don't have the log on speed dial so i've no idea what the question was<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> ok so the cannonical statement of this problem would be : how do you transform foreach i in A tree[i]</p>
<p><b>ben_vulpes</b> i struggle to comprehend, but it may simply take time. have notepad out nao<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> (obviously this is extremely repetitive, so ideally the struct is not evil wrt memory usage)<br />
<b>phf</b> ...</p>
<p><b>phf</b> so we have three items "one" "two" "three"<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> initially we have a string of these. yeah. hai Framedragger<br />
<b>ben_vulpes</b> hola Framedragger</p>
<p><b>phf</b> and then you're doing a permutation?<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> phf then for each individual item, i take all the remainder, and make them nodes ; and all the combinations of the remainder, also make individual nodes. and then for each of these node, the remainder idem</p>
<p><b>ben_vulpes</b> i think i start to see the algo<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> it should be easy if you know what you're doing!!1<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> all recursion!11<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> has nfi</p>

<b>mircea_popescu</b> darn</p>

<b>ben_vulpes</b> mhm. cs 201 here i come</p>
<p><b>phf</b> everyone's hiding out the storm here<sup><a href="#footnote_5_71072" id="identifier_5_71072" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="At the time His Lordship the Lord Admiral had just introduced a whole new line of cannons resulting in slightly stormy seas.">vi</a></sup><br />
<b>ben_vulpes</b> mircea_popescu: and duplicates?<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> knock out dups. "one two three four one" = "one two three four" in this grammar</p>
<p><b>ben_vulpes</b> how can three be a leaf of third order off of (one two) if (one two) is a leaf of first order? i (one two) also a leaf of second order off of three?<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> let me carefully check the example. one-two intends to signify 1st order leaf is "one", 2nd order is "two". contrairwise, (one, two) intends to signify the leaf is actually "one two" as such</p>
<p><b>ben_vulpes</b> ah<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> i prolly should have said one->two<br />
<b>ben_vulpes</b> dun think mine's right yet</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> phf that actually seems exactly right unless i woefully misunderstand the parens. so there's 7 leaves first rank ; of these 1 has 0 subleaves ; 3 have 1 subleaf and 3 have 3 subleaves.  that right  ?<br />
<b>phf</b> yes<sup><a href="#footnote_6_71072" id="identifier_6_71072" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Consider that it took him the holy 20 minutes to solve this problem and you're well on your way of understanding why the guy's such a famous lisper.">vii</a></sup></p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> yep, winner. how did you do it ? :D<br />
<b>phf</b> recursion!</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> lol<br />
<b>ben_vulpes</b> "two is 3rd order off one->three"? or is two actually 3rd order off of one->two</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> 1st order : one ; 2nd order : two ; 3rd order : three. it's probably a three liner, too. damnit.<br />
<b>phf</b> http://p.bvulpes.com/pastes/VqDC2/?raw=true<br />
<b>phf</b> that's a naive version though</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> so defun subsets introduces a function ?<br />
<b>phf</b> yeap</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> (split-sequence:split-sequence #\space s :remove-empty-subseqs t)<br />
<b>ben_vulpes</b> remove-duplicates</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> ben_vulpes aha.<br />
<b>ben_vulpes</b> (not for chars)</p>
<p><b>phf</b> well, no, first it splits it on whitespace, then it removes duplicates<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> but i want it first to nuke non-alpha, then split it, then remove.<br />
<b>ben_vulpes</b> i'm out for a bit</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> laters ben_vulpes<br />
<b>ben_vulpes</b> neat puzzle. will refrain from answer guide for now.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> i'd gladly read alt implementation for my own culture. this adventure has increased the total lisp code i ever read by a hefty %<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> phf and what's remove-if (lambda (a) (member a sub)) items))) do ?<br />
<b>phf</b> so you have a list, items. plain remove as a first argument takes what you want to remove (remove a (a b a c)) -> (b c)</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> aha<br />
<b>phf</b> but in this case we want to remove things conditionally. for each item in the list "items" we want to remove an item if it's a member of "sub" list.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> we do.<br />
<b>phf</b> so (lambda (...) ...) introduces an anonymous function</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> which returns true if a is in sub ?<br />
<b>phf</b> yeap. (lambda (a) (member a sub)) is (member a sub) waiting for execution. (member element list) in turn return "true" if element's in the list. </p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> or wait. lambda (a) (a) returns a if a = a ?<br />
<b>phf</b> yes. (lambda (a) a) is an identity function (there's also a standard equivalent called "identity")</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> so to verbalize this, remove-if (lambda (a) (member a sub)) items))) means, remove from items element x defined as whatever lambda thinks x and "member x sub" means ?<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> lol check it out, even the verbalisation demands parens<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> so to verbalize this, remove-if (lambda (a) (member a sub)) items))) means, remove from items element x defined as whatever lambda thinks (x "member x sub") means ?<br />
<b>phf</b> hmm, pretty close</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> what did i miss ?<br />
<b>phf</b> lambda decides what "(x) (member x sub)" means during compilation. it returns a thing (a higher order function). that higher order function is what's making the decisions. remove looks at each item and compares it with first argument. remove-if looks at each item and for each item asks its first argument to make decision</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> aha. ok, i might have a clue as to how this works, maybe. now, if i wanted to associate a number with each node, would it go into this struct or should i make a separate struct ?<br />
<b>phf</b> i mean subsets is pretty straightforward, and maps to a concept. (subsets '(1 2 3)) -> (NIL (3) (2) (2 3) (1) (1 3) (1 2) (1 2 3)). so the bulk of specific complexity sits in "tree-thingy".</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> right. hm i thought tree-tingy was a function.<br />
<b>phf</b> right, it is. i mean bulk of problem's complexity is in the code of tree-thingy.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> ah yes.<br />
<b>phf</b> but yeah, so re "separate structure" it's usually just a question of optimization. you could add numbering to tree-thingy and if you're generating a gigantic tree that might be a better option.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> it looks like it would be pretty large yes. but more from a laziness pov, i'd prefer to use the easiest reference model :)<br />
<b>phf</b> right, from didactic perspective (and also how i would've approach this problem by default) is to have a separate tree walker that takes the result of tree-thingy and produces a new tree, which has all the nodes numbered. it's probably another 5-7 line function.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> i don't want them numbered, i want a number added so i can give the nodes weight. i guess it's what you meant.<br />
<b>phf</b> oh oh. e're on the same page here.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> so as to go from  ( ("one" "two" "three"))) to  ( ("one" "two" "three") (0.556))) or such. is that even correct notation ?<br />
<b>phf</b> so it's a little bit tricky because lisp list processing at the bedrock operates on "cons cells" rather than lists, and in code i'm mixing and matching them. sometimes a structure of many cons cells is a valid list, but sometimes not</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> hm. and for that matter, how do i use references ? suppose i want to find the content of the leaf off one->three. how do i say tree(one(three)) ?<br />
<b>phf</b> (cons "a" (cons "b" (cons "c" nil))) -> ("a" "b" "c"). likewise (cons "a" (list "b" "c")) -> ("a" "b" "c").</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> so (cons "a" (cons "b")) would return ("c") ?<br />
<b>phf</b> no no cons is for building things.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> ah yes. but i want to get the specific leaf from the tree now. or i'm sorry, am i interrupting ?<br />
<b>phf</b> i'm trying to decide if the whole cons/list thing is worth fully driving home at the moment :)</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> alrighty, go ahead :)<br />
<b>phf</b> cons is a building block, basically, that is often used to produce valid lists. but in order to navigate the result you have to visualize what the cons structure looks like</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> right<br />
<b>phf</b> there are functions for navigating a cons structure. so in order to actually reference stuff you basically need to grok what the result of "tree-thingy" looks like, and then produce an appropriate combination of referencing calls</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> so if i had the tree from above and i wanted to get one->two->three.content and one->two.weight, i'd be writing my own function rather than using some sort of referencing scheme ?<br />
<b>phf</b> pretty much</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> tsk. so how do i say "return a list of all nudes hanging from a node called "two three"" ?<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> uh... nodes. obviously.<br />
<b>phf</b> :D</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> but ideally as a list, or w/e, an iterable array, or what's it called. something i can go a[iterator] over<br />
<b>phf</b> (defun string-set-equal (a b) (and (subsetp a b :test 'string-equal) (subsetp b a :test 'string-equal)))<br />
<b>phf</b> (defun get-node (node tree) (assoc node tree :test 'string-set-equal))</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> so as to the first : define a function called "string-set-equal" to take two parameters and to return uh... to return the intersection of checking if a b or b a are string-equal to test ?<br />
<b>phf</b> heh, so the more code the more complexity :) you can kind of stick to the basic set of concepts, but at some point it just becomes impractical</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> my interest is mostly in terms of getting this notion on paper.<br />
<b>phf</b> string-set-equal takes two lists-of-strings and checks if they are the same, ignoring the order</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> ok. so defun isn't followed by the name of the item defined necessarily ?<br />
<b>phf</b> it is. what was an explanation of what my defined function does</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> oh i thought you meant above "is" as in, language primitive. like "for". i guess my very imperative reading style isn'rt adequate for lisp huh. carry on!<br />
<b>phf</b> well, lisp has very few language primitives. there's something like 10, and of the ones that is in the code only if and let are primitives.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> aha. and lambda ?<br />
<b>phf</b> right :) it's a primitive in LISP (and scheme) and for all practical purposes it is in common lisp to, but technically in common lisp specifically it's not a special operator</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> ah. k.<br />
<b>phf</b> but yeah, so (subsetp a b) checks if a is a subset of b, e.g. (1 2 3) (1 2 3 4) -> t</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> ah it returns true rather than the subset. ok.<br />
<b>phf</b> if a is a subset of b and b is a subset of a, then both are equal. :test 'string-equal is a clarification that equality should be tested in a more precise way. specifically i'm trying to see if strings inside that list are equal ignoring the case differences. (string-equal "ABC" "abc") -> t</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> ah darn, this also doesn't belong here. so ideally i want to transform the message string prior to all this processing : all lowercase, nothing but alphabetic chars and space. then we can make strong assumptions here that you don't need that, making the code simpler.<br />
<b>phf</b> ah, there's actually a way</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> a string isn't a list of characters i don't expect ?<br />
<b>phf</b> yeah.. it's an ~array~ of characters</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> uh<br />
<b>phf</b> the distinction is there because von neumann</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> wait lisp has arrays ?  so epic, how do i say for i 1 to size of message if message[i] not in [a..z ] delete it ? (to my mind, if it wasn't obvious, an array is a list with item counter)<br />
<b>phf</b> that actually goes back to a thread long time ago<sup><a href="#footnote_7_71072" id="identifier_7_71072" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This unresolved reference is pending resolution. Meanwhile it was resolved.">viii</a></sup></p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> aha<br />
<b>phf</b> on von neumann machines array/list is an artifact of memory management.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> yeah. hence why i say counter, the assumption being there's nothing between 2 and 3. anyway, so if message = "hurr" can i say message[2] and does it yield u or r ?<br />
<b>phf</b> array is preallocated memory region, that you can reference into at constant time, but can't resize. a list is a growable structure, that can't reference into at constant time, but can "resize". lisp does the same count from 0 thing, so #\r. it'll be something like (elt "hurr" 2) -> #\r</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> whjat's #\r ? don't tell me # is alphanum and \r is space<br />
<b>phf</b> that's how lisp prints and reads individual characters in code</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> is this bulky as fuck ? what's the cannonical way to constrain the message space through deletion ?<br />
<b>phf</b> it's the same number of characters total as C, 'r'. but anyway, to finally get back to the point :D i've no idea about canonical, but if i were to do it, i will convert string to list, filter it using list filtering procedures and then convert it back</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> why would you convert it to list ?! why not iterate through array, and if element fits our bill push it into a list ? (and in passing let it be said i am profoundly worried about a language space that doesn't have a cannonical way to take a message M made out of elements in A and transform it into M' made out of elements in A')<br />
<b>phf</b> that actually works too, it's not necessarily cheaper though</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> how could it be cheaper to transform toi list too ? does compiler optimize the shit out of what we tell it anyway ?<br />
<b>phf</b> i didn't say it's cheaper, i said that it's not necessarily too expensive :}</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> you said it's not necessarily cheaper, that means the other could be cheaper!<br />
<b>phf</b> that's fair</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> minor point. so how do i iterate through array a, and if item is in set push it into list b ?<br />
<b>phf</b> actually, i'm being all over the place. so if specifically we want to remove characters out of a string, it'll be something like (remove-if-not (lambda (a) (find a "abcdef")) "abc, xyz, def") which will return "abce"</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> and i enumerate the alphabet there ?<br />
<b>phf</b> yeap</p>

<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> ah doesn't parse out its name<br />
<b>phf</b> i think paste is not working right. you're passing it a list, and it wants a string</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> yeh. btw, does tree-thingy-string recreate the tree as a new struct on each pass ?<br />
<b>phf</b> that's a nifty tree though</p>

<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> goes reads log again<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> motherfucker.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> why the fuck doesn't (remove "candilustt" &lt;>) remove it from &lt;> !<br />
<b>phf</b> mircea_popescu: correct direction, but exactly what's happening there</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> huh ? phf it shockingly removed dick<br />
<b>phf</b> removes removes items from a sequence, not subsequences. so remove can remove a character from a sequence of characters. but you're missing a function in your paste tree-thingy-string</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> i am ? how do i remove abc from abcde ? not (remove "abc" "abcde") ?<br />
<b>phf</b> you have tree-thingy, but no tree-thingy-string. everything's still working because tree-thingy-string is sitting in memory</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> uh oh (paste (tree-thingy-string<br />
<b>phf</b> right, the call is there, but not the definition (defun tree-thingy-string</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> the definition is below ?<br />
<b>phf</b> tree-thingy is bellow, not tree-thingy->>string&lt;&lt;</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> ow fuck malfunction. kk good point. so why does    (remove "candilustt" (remove-if-not (lambda (a) (find a "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz ")) message)) fail to take out her name from the line ?<br />
<b>phf</b> because remove compares ~each individual character~ to ~string~, which is always false, so there's nothing to remove.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> oh i see. is there something to compare chunks ? and is remove a primitive then ? or did we define it ?<br />
<b>phf</b> yeah, remove is part of the spec</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> a ok. now, i'd expect quoting string creates proper squence and remove then deletes it. but that's just me. i suppose i shou;ld add a nill there<br />
<b>BingoBoingo</b> Hello candi_lustt, who is your daddy and what does he do?</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> BingoBoingo the way it's set up now it uses a ton of processing for anything over 3-4 words long.<br />
<b>phf</b> so for some unknown reason there's nothing like remove subsequence in the standard, there's a different place to slice in though, and it's inside the missing tree-thingy-string</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> phf no! this is nonsense, why the fuck would i slice it there. i want to send the proc a properly formed message</p>
<p><b>phf</b> nods<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> also, the fact that it takes over a minute to create the tree off BingoBoingo 's sentence is very worrysome. why is it this incredibly slow ?!<br />

<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> the problem of "take 'abc' out of 'abcd ef' so as to get 'd ef'" ?<br />
<b>phf</b> ye</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> am i unreasonable thinking this makes lisp less of a language than even perl, php, etc ?<br />
<b>phf</b> yes</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> can you explain it ? and if you're wondering i have no intention of keeping that ppcre in there, either. i put it in because curious if it works, that's all.<br />
<b>phf</b> well, ok, i think it would've been handy to have a "remove a subsequence from a sequence" operation in the standard. that operation doesn't actually exist in perl or php. what perl and php gives you, since they are unix languages, are a lot of ops that let you manipulate strings in a haphazard manner. "remove a substring from a string" is one of them. lisper solution is if you're going to muck with strings that way, then just use a regexp</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> because a string is a subtype of array (ie with single-byte elements) and if you're going to fuck with deletion in arrays might as well do it honestly, and lisp has delegated "fuck with array and spit out list" to "regexp" ?<br />

<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> yeh, reason i'm bitching is that it'd increase my code 60%<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> nobody 'delegated', the ppcre thing was written eons after standard was closed.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> I mean mentally. his solution seems to be "just use regexp" which im trying to evaluate. what makes him think this way and why.<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> whether this is same as complaining that your house didn't come with a cement mixer, or if it had not come with washer, is matter of taste. but often you will find that you are doing Wrong Thing, algorithmically, if you are continuously reaching for these absent pieces.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> i'm keenly aware of that possibility yeah. which is why i'm so verbose about this.<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> so, in mircea_popescu's case, there ~is~ a 'subst' in the standard, which substitutes in subtrees.<br />
<b>phf</b> mircea_popescu: well, no ~my solution~ is different</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> oh did i get confused ? what was your solution ?<br />
<b>phf</b> the reason why i for example said, move it into tree-thingy-string is because you're constructing a lot of concepts here, that you keep implicit. like you keep talking about "words", whereas your input is just a string of characters. a correct solution is to have a thing that knows how to convert string to words (even if very naively) and then after manipulate the result in terms of word (i want to remove word "candy_lust" from the list of words)</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> why the fuck does the "only character" limitation exist, even! i can't grasp this.<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> exist in what ?</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> in remove. and am i misguided to worry about the insanity of processing data i know i don't want processed ? such as all those subleaves i won't want or use ?<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> it doesn't.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> then what the fuck's the problem ? if i can remove "a" i should be able to remove "ab".<br />
<b>phf</b> asciilifeform: he means "only single element"</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> these aren't substantially different. i am being sold a house with a special door only allowing men to pass! WTF!<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> mircea_popescu: no! "ab" is not a single object !</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> how the fuck not.<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> it is algorithmically wholly different game, to remove a ~subsequence~. it isn't an O(N) operation any more.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> so in this sense lisp is even more narrowly married to the hardware than c ? "but mp, it makes no difference a one letter and a two letter word are the same thing, we didn't implement it that way".<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> they aren't the same thing on any known iron in any known universe</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> two byte items are for 16 bit machines what one byte items were on 8 bit machines : machine words. but this aside, seriously, i need to care as a high level language user what the register size was at some point because someone thought it a good idea to bake "char" length into their algos ? really now, of the byte-array "abc", "ab" is an element just as "a" is an element. you will have to cut up this array, and presumably will prefer to spit out a list. this is nice. whether you cut by the character or by the 58 characters should be irrelevant to you, and user-specified.<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> the language is bitness-agnostic. but 'string' is defined as 'vector of characters' and a 'vector' is a thing that can be operated on one element at a time. now there was once a d00d named danny hillis, and he built 'connection machine', which operated on 65536 things at a time, and he ~did~ have to augment commonlisp to make this semantically convenient in it. fwiw. but even there, 'nix the substrings' is NOT a thing that you get 'for free' without thinking about it. because it is algorithmically nontrivial.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> how do i define my lines to be proper lists rather than this, and were i to so define them, could i sanely process them ? fuck this "string vector" bs, i have nfi why it exists even<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> mircea_popescu: it exists because -- as phf iirc explained earlier in thread -- ~list~ is not a random access item on vonneumann machine, it is O(N). whereas array access is O(1).</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> i want the string "abc" to be interpreted by the machine as the list "a"->"b"->"c"->nil whereby the deletion of "b" requires changing ONE pointer ; and the deletion of "bc" requires changing... ONE pointer. and to do this i gotta collect both strings ? i'm starting to understand the wisdom of phf 's "do it in tree thingy". if you use "words" then first define words, then nuke the bad word.<br />

<b>candi_lustt</b> You don't trick me, sly mircea_popescu with your NIL lures!<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> lol</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> and the saddest part is that i struggle with conceptually coming up with a model that usefully de-stringifies a string for lisp's needs that's also not a whole ai by itself. the whole fucking point of natural language, on meditation, appears to very much be "it not being lisp". in any case the impedance mismatch of primitives is well shocking.<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> ppcre more or less turns the thing into perl, for use by incorrigible perlists. if you really must, can use that.</p>

<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> riight.<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> ~everybody has heavily custom workflow. asciilifeform for instance has a button on keyboard that evaluates the form the editor cursor is in. and another that evaluates any highlighted forms. a 'form' in this case is any (..........) that isn't inside of some other (.......) in file.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> yes, and i'm sure it works for you, but you don't have a good answer to "what was that then" that you can show me. i could show you. this is something, even if it's not the something you want to have.<br />
<b>ben_vulpes</b> what is this "what was that then"?<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> the answer to 'what was that' is the 'that', which i have just as readily here (a list of forms that got evaluated)</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> ben_vulpes i don't have all this set up for search, but he asked me above "where did these symbols come from". the whole process that produced them is right there ready to be examined. by him, even if it was my process. he/you want to tell me about how your process is ready for you to examine. that's nice, but also a fundamentally different thing.<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> if you treat your proggy as a set of lines that get eval'd sequentially, from scratch every time, as if you were writing bash script -- this is fine, and you get serialization for phreee, but at the cost of losing the repl. ideally you write in such a way that you don't violate the semantics by repling (and so pasting your code results in something another fella can replicate, if you are collaborating)<sup><a href="#footnote_13_71072" id="identifier_13_71072" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This probably works acceptably well if the two are collaborating, but I'm damned sure nobody learned to code this way, because they can't, because it's insane.">xiv</a></sup><br />

<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> hm! so subseq takes string and returns substring between two indices ?<br />

<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> asciilifeform the sadness right now is that you just dropped the bomb of all time pointing out "turn string vector into list of string vectors by character delimiter" is ppcre also. which maxed my dosimeter.<br />
<b>phf</b> mircea_popescu: it's not actually ppcre, but it's not in the standard either</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> what's "not in the standard" mean here ?<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> mircea_popescu: it means 1) not in http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw50/CLHS/Front/X_AllSym.htm and 2) not guaranteed to be available on a brand-new cltron<br />
<b>phf</b> well, point 2 is kind of irrelevant</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> should i care about either of these ?<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> whole point of a standard...<br />
<b>phf</b> it's third party code, written on top of the bedrock<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> because if you don't give a fuck about standard, and 'i'll stick with sbcl for life!!!' you suddenly have ~all of the missing parts<br />
<b>phf</b> ok this is actually misinformation given the subject</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> standard is one thing, but at some point someone is going to write a fucking library . i can't reject everyone's libraries because they're someone's libraries.<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> phf: how's that -- pretty sure sbcl has complex string-munging in it<br />
<b>phf</b> split-sequence doesn't come with any lisp environment, it's third party code, that's written in lisp. i.e. a library<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> mircea_popescu: there is ppcre.<br />

<b>phf</b> yes</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> how does it go ?<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> ( (possibly) interestingly, cltl2 has some discussion of items that were considered for inclusion in the standard, but did not make it, and why )<br />

<b>ben_vulpes</b> ah i see what you're trying to do<br />
<b>trinque</b> lisp has a notion of multiple return values from a function. done by doing (values 1 2 3)</p>

<b>ben_vulpes</b> correct. </p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> holy shit there;s a "define" which DOES?NT define the thing ?<br />

<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> and to make it return three values i... change  (values words (length words)) to (values words (length words) "the letter 4") ? and so values is a keyword which does what return does ?<br />
<b>ben_vulpes</b> aye. now to bind that you'll need multiple-value-bind</p>

<b>ben_vulpes</b> to use the return values of that function elsewhere, you'll need to bind them explicitly at the call site of mp-split, otherwise you'll only get the first. standby.<br />

<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> anyway, i'd like to continue but i'm entirely mentally exhausted. so perhaps another day.<br />
<b>phf</b> hehe, i knew when to zone out :} there's a dozen of layers of complexity in common lisp. there are parts that date back to mccarthy's LISP days, and those are traditionally used for teaching purposes, because for all practical purposes they are reducible to cons cells and recursion. yesterday today made me convinced that there's wisdom in hanging further knowledge off of those rather than going for "best practices".</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> so thinking about it - on one level it's a fact that what i want to use are two distinct types - "lines", which consist of alphabetic characters + spaces and "words", which consist of alphabetic characters only ; and on the next level that i was not aware of this, specifically, but vaguely, before running into the lisp obnoxiousball, so therefore it can both be said that it is useful in that it organizes thought and hoped  that it can be chiseled into less obnoxious more ball with a little more practice than two days' worth.</p>
<p><b>davout</b> o god. this ia thing is alive. after reading #chainstate my conclusion is that mircea_popescu would enjoy ruby very much!<br />
<b>trinque</b> o lawd<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> lol and whyssat davout ?</p>
<p><b>davout</b> string manipulation just seemed very painful<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> well, a large part of the problem is that strings aren't something. ie, the veterans' objections couldn't be dismissed.</p>
<p><b>davout</b> yeah, of course<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> on which basis i enjoy ruby a lot less.</p>
<p><b>davout</b> the point is simply that it bundles a good bit of convenience, which may or may not be a good thing depending on the particular point of view. either way, the repl looks pretty nifty</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> the objection is that it bundles incorrect convenience, which is NEVER a good thing. link here to http://btcbase.org/log/2017-01-09#1599790 ; anyway, i quite enjoyed flailing for definitions once i realised what the problem was (you can tell i move to arrays at some point in a desperate bid etc)<br />
<b>a111</b> Logged on 2017-01-09 15:10 mircea_popescu: this is how a mother acts, and why kids have not much business with her past the age of about 10 or so, depending how retarded they are.<br />
<b>davout</b> what distinguishes correct from incorrect convenience ?</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> something (convenience, anything else) is correct if it scales, which is to say is derived from the prime mover. anything else - incorrect. sinful is also a proper attribute of incorrectness, because it is literally a headless spawn of the very devil.<br />
<b>davout</b> not sure i really get what you mean by "it scales". if you bundle lots of shit, it quickly becomes unmanageable because all abstractions and conveniences have a cost.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> not so. i can go from everything i do in an infinite string of correct whys to prime logic. broken shit can't do that. possibly your idea of "scales" is tainted by the idiots, "to scale means to be used by a larger cattle headcount". that has nothing to do. to scale means to go up the abstraction tree. an apple is a correct apple if it scales, ie, if the concept of apple follows from it.<br />
<b>davout</b> what's "prime mover" in this context?</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> literally the aristotelian imperative. the first thing to have moved.<br />
<b>davout</b> it's still not very clear to me how the ability to manipulate string a bit more easily is equivalent to heresy. would the same functionality, included in cl's standard be deemed heretic?<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> davout: notice that it ~wasn't~ included! 'if your grandmother had balls...'<br />
<b>davout</b> i do</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> "it's not clear to me how the ability to manipulate something you can'd define is equivalent to http://btcbase.org/log/2016-12-16#1583902 "<br />
<b>a111</b> Logged on 2016-12-16 06:24 trinque: in other python 2 was already shit... all([]) -> True   yet   any([]) -> False</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> all you need is a false implication somewhere, davout ; ANYWHERE. once you have it then everything becomes provable.<br />
<b>davout</b> strings defined as byte vectors is pretty unambiguous</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> yes but now define ruby's notion of substr. see the whole point of "string" as a concept (and from it, as a type) is based on a fundamental ambiguity. now it's this, now it's that.<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> davout: cl chars ain't bytes. nor null-termed, nor contiguous in memory</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> that's an anti-helpful objection.<br />
<b>davout</b> i'm afraid i don't see that particular ambiguity</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> i know. i hadn't seen it until yesterday either.<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> it is in fact useful to remember that the 'convenience' of cstring is == to the 'convenience' of shitting on the floor where you stand.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> this is something you can remember only if you already groked it.<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> tru</p>
<p><b>davout</b> mircea_popescu: #chainstate ref plox?<br />
<b>Framedragger</b> inb4 cross-channel reference and search system!!<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> there's two points. one, where i saw it at the periphery and feared it may be a thing, which made me pretty pissy : http://logs.bvulpes.com/chainstate?d=2017-1-11#1340 and then http://logs.bvulpes.com/chainstate?d=2017-1-11#1374 as the issue was structuring in my head. then of course the closing comments early today morning, http://logs.bvulpes.com/chainstate?d=2017-1-12#323 as the thing couldn't actually be dismissed. if you look through the log it's pretty evident alf understands exactly what the problem is, in spite of his deeply boneheaded, inept self-expression. which sadly makes it evident only retrospectively. then again how to speak truth to clueless is a quite open problem in the first place. but that's why he speaks of socialism and getting for free and etc. </p>
<p><b>davout</b> the reason some of the string primitives aren't included, e.g. "substring" is that they're O(n)? In other words, that the convenience comes at the cost of incentivizing operator idiocy?<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> vice-versa : they have to cost that, because they're stuck papering over the fact that the operator has no idea what he wants.<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> well, for starters, much worse than O(n), but mircea_popescu nails it.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> the computer doesn't in the slightest mind running in a for loop from now until the heat-end of history. however, it would humbly request you actually write its death sentence deliberately rather than by uncomprehended accidenty. which is altogether not an unreasonable bar for all slavery.<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> this is main reason why haskell and other 'lazy eval' systems are malignant -- they create 'secret talmud' of workable ops, that are not visually distinct from intractable ones.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> mistreating the slaves is the ruin of the house.<br />
<b>davout</b> right.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> don't tell me all this nonsense now makes sense to you ?<br />
<b>davout</b> i see your point mucho better</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> well then.<br />
<b>davout</b> not sure what asciilifeform means in his last comment<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> which, ?<br />
<b>davout</b> mircea_popescu: i see the point in general, but i'm not sure i'd take it as far as considering some additional string primitives as being evil<br />
<b>davout</b> http://btcbase.org/log/2017-01-12#1601874<br />
<b>a111</b> Logged on 2017-01-12 14:09 asciilifeform: they create 'secret talmud' of workable ops, that are not visually distinct from intractable ones</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> well, entirely depends on your definition of evil, but the point remains they're not helping you, they're just smothering you. aka "you can get some version of what you possibly wanted done very easy at the cost of understanding what you actually wanted or what the hell's the differece.". cue ballas with his "there's a difference between what you need and what you want, and the media will relentlessly give you strings".<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> in some programming systems, it is very easy to inadvertently ask the machine to solve an np-hard problem. and for 0 good reason, other than that making such a language stroked academitard cocks. in other languages, e.g., python, ruby, there is a lesser sin, you end up stuffing multitude of O(n) ops in places where you oughta have O(1), O(n^2) ops where with some thought you could've had O(n), etc. and the braindamage adds up<br />
<b>davout</b> ic</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> it's very symbolically imperial, also. the language of "rights" and "rule of law" makes it trival to start a "war on drugs" or "women against rape". then the state ends and everyone is at a loss why the fuck it did.<br />
<b>davout</b> yea, i guess the question is where you stop. at which point do you decide that you're going to buy these apples instead of growing them, because ultimately you want an apple pie</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> no, not really, because i buy ~apples~. your question would be "at which point you stop buying canned frozen fruit tm for your apple pie". anyone may give his own answer, but in my case it's long, long ago. and yes i plant my own lovage, in buenos aires, because the plant doesn't exist and "soup condiment mix" doesn't satisfy.<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> davout: http://www.xach.com/naggum/articles/3144404199547949@naggum.no.html</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> '...suppose you drive down the highway and you suddenly want to go some nice place you saw just before you pass a forest.  you veer off the road, plunge into the wilderness and promptly decide that you need four-wheel drive, a huge cutting device in front of your car, much better shock absorbers, a bigger engine that could actually run on swamp water instead of getting all drowned, and then need an amphibious vehicle to get across the'll that right away after you made up your mind to veer off the road, and This Is Surely Somebody's Fault...'</p>

<b>mircea_popescu</b> the only sad part here is that lisp dun actually seem to be usable for computation.</p>
<p><b>davout</b> same as a plane i guess, gotta spend some time sucking before actually being able to go on your own<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> the plane actually flies.</p>
<p><b>davout</b> well, not if you don't know how to beat it into submission!<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> i am more or less satisfied with the beating. the problem is that when i finally took off it seems to be going at ~0.001m/s which is not a speed.</p>
<p><b>mimisbrunnr</b> block 447988: 2`443 txns, 998`170 bytes, 30m, 31s<br />
<b>davout</b> ah i see, you did get to the "exceedingly lengthy lures" part :D i reluctantly come to the conclusion that i'll *have* to get into lisp at some point in the near future if only to resolve the cognitive dissonance between "this language looks horrible to me" and "these people that i think are very smart seem to have a very good opinion of it"</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> i think it's a fine aide for thinking, in the sense that trying to write your problem in lisp will make you understand your problem well / it is impossible to write it in lisp until you understood it well. seems however after you do understand it you are then stuck going back to c and being all bitter about it. which would certainly explain alf's humours. nevertheless, phf DID somehow manage to process respectable quantities of text. if btcbase log hadn't existed i wouldn't even have considered lisp in the first place. so i wonder what exactly is going on here. i guess we find out when they wake up.<br />
<b>davout</b> i suspect it's of the same nature as "if violence doesn't solve your problem, you're not using enough of it". anyway, i'm off, laterz!</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> a hundred element list turned into a full tree produces about 25k nodes. that's not a notable item in terms of modern computings. actually the formula is simply n! isn't it. tsk. so the problem rather is, by my count there were 20 words there, which means<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> !~calc 20!<br />
<b>jhvh1</b>  mircea_popescu: 20! = 2432902008176640000</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> that's a bit much. it can prune these, because it's making a tree not a list of permutations, but even so, i can see what teh problem is.</p></blockquote>
<p>Quite the read, huh ?</p>
<p>Anyway, the thing I was aiming to do is : </p>
<ul>
<li>Every time the bot is highlighted, it tokenizes the chatline as above. All of these go into the same tree as briefly discussed.</li>
<p>
<li>Each node in the tree has, other than the word payload, a numeric value associated.</li>
<p>
<li>Every time the bot hears a line, it selects all full passes through the tree that include at least one word from the line, and indexes them by the product of the node values.</li>
<p>
<li> Whenever the resulting product is above a certain value, it outputs that line.</li>
<p>
<li>Whenever two tree passes have the same value, it asks something like "what is [shared trunk] ?"</li>
<p>
<li>There should also be some skulduggery involved with increasing the values associated to nodes on the basis of the trunk being heard and on the basis of specific "cookie" feedings by humans.</li>
</ul>
<p>I won't be completing this, because meanwhile I figured out that this design requires significant computing resources which I am not willing to commit. I do still believe it is a reasonable approach to artificial intelligence, as well as the correct model for "language learning" as it takes place in infants<sup><a href="#footnote_19_71072" id="identifier_19_71072" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Incidentally a fine approach to estimate the volume of work done by the human -- as opposed to dragonfly -- brain : if Trilema's ~20 million words were as they are set out in a million sentences, then you'd be looking at about a million iterations of that 2 1018 nodes processing into one humongo tree. There aren't yet man made computers capable of handling this immense load, much like there aren't yet man made engines capable of powering a dragonfly's day out of the two calories its diet provides.
And no, it makes no difference for the purposes of this discussion that it's Trilema as opposed to someone yakking on TV. All infantile brains learn any language, irrespective of their parents' culture, genetics etcetera, on the strict basis of spending years doing the above tree parsing, over however many million sentences you can churn at them.

There aren't yet man made computers capable of handling this immense load, much like there aren't yet man made engines capable of powering a dragonfly's day out of the two calories its diet provides.</p>
<p>And no, it makes no difference for the purposes of this discussion that it's Trilema as opposed to someone yakking on TV. All infantile brains learn any language, irrespective of their parents' culture, genetics etcetera, on the strict basis of spending years doing the above tree parsing, over however many million sentences you can churn at them. How a hundred billion neurons manage to process and store millions of exanodes is anyone's guess, and far far <strong>far</strong> outside the scope of this humble article.
