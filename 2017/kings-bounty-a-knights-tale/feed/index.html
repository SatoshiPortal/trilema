		<description>I thought that Mithril Shield thing gave 20% leadership not +2 morale ; but anyway the map you trade to the elves girl for 10 of each rune, what the hell. I can't afford to miss out on 30 runes to (partially) fix broken dwarves what is this.

The Priest trick is actulaly neat, now if only I managed enough gold to actually recruit my seemingly bottomless stacks...</description>

		<description>Dwarves can get max morale too, +1 from the dwarf wife, +2 from the shield their king gives you in exchange for the map.

Also if you have the inquisitor upgrade it is better to play with priests not bowmen. You put a lot of priests in reserve and if you lose any priests or inquisitors you just supply from there. Two stacks reserved rather than one!</description>
