<b>mircea_popescu</b>	Captain_Beezay back in 2014, http://btcbase.org/log/2014-10-28#900086<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b>	Riastradh: FUCKGOATS is an rs232 device. works equally well with, e.g., msdos, as with bsd. and with pdp11 as well as with pentium.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	speaking of which, is there a log website for this channel ? or how do i search past conversations ?</p>
<p><b>Riastradh</b>	Yes, but I can't detect that it is a FUCKGOATS device and automatically feed it to the entropy pool.  It will look just like any other serial device, requiring operator intervention to know to use a userland program to connect to the serial interface and feed data from that to /dev/random.<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b>	that's actually deliberate.<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b>	it is meant to be used ~instead of~ whatever crock of shit your kernel came with.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	Riastradh you get something for that.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	eg the fact that someone else snooping around can't distinguish it from a keyboard.<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b>	well, from modem.<br />
<b>sarnold</b>	"boy this modem sure spits out a bunch of  random gibberish"<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	from line device, anyways.</p>
<p><b>Captain_Beezay</b> has a serious problem with the name,anything that wants to be used professionally needs to have a sfw non-profane name.<br />
<b>Riastradh</b>	mircea_popescu: To get logs for the channel, send your resume to jobs@nsa.gov, go through a long security clearance process, &#038;c., and then you will know what to do.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	Captain_Beezay the idea is to wholesale replace your notion of "professional", so that it is no longer socially acceptable to go around saying "sfw".<br />
<b>Riastradh</b>	asciilifeform: Not sure what you're getting at here with `crock of shit your kernel came with'.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	Riastradh it is a more important question than meets the eye. the fact that trilema has fully searchable logs significantly improves the quality of discussion going on and at the same time the quality of throughts thought by the participants.</p>
<p><b>Captain_Beezay</b>	mircea_popescu: No,the author is just being an inconsiderate self centered jerk<sup><a href="#footnote_5_72757" id="identifier_5_72757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="

A. No, the guy is just a jerk.
Fancy that wonder.">vi</a></sup><br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	aha.<br />
<b>Riastradh</b>	mircea_popescu: Your profundity is duly noted.  I suggest you redirect your commentary on what constitutes professionalism to a channel more suited to the topic, say ##ideologies.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	remind me why i care what you suggest ; explain what exactly "noted" is supposed to mean here, you don't have a public log ; it's not directly clear what you're talking about anyway, i wasn't discussing what constitutes professionalism.</p>
<p>*	Captain_Beezay missed the line about mircea_popescu saying he was the principal. sorry for the rudeness<br />
<b>Captain_Beezay</b>	mircea_popescu: I just don't appreciate others pushing their ideology on me using their technical achievements.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	Captain_Beezay i dun care about rudeness either way, but i like it when people make sense. otherwise, the whole point of technology is to push ideology on others.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	that's what it does.</p>
<p><b>Captain_Beezay</b>	you have the right to name it anything you want<br />
<b>Framedragger</b>	Riastradh: re. 'crock of shit', i think what was meant was that there is implicit trust in the kernel's csprng (with additional dubious operations done, including but not limited to whitening)<br />
<b>Captain_Beezay</b>	I will oppose acceptance of any such product as well.<br />
<b>Riastradh</b>	mircea_popescu: That's all very nice.  Now please take your ideological proselytism back to a channel where it's on-topic.<br />
<b>Framedragger</b>	you people do realise that *you* raised the 'ideology' topic, right?<br />
<b>sarnold</b>	Framedragger: you trust the kernel for -everything-<br />
<b>sarnold</b>	Framedragger: in the same way that you trust the cpu for -everything-<br />
<b>Framedragger</b>	what, no, that's a classical slippery slope falacy.<br />
<b>Framedragger</b>	there is no need to trust the kernel to be the source of your randomness.<br />
<b>Captain_Beezay</b>	mircea_popescu: technology is a tool,how we use it is according to our own beliefs<sup><a href="#footnote_6_72757" id="identifier_6_72757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I expect he also imagines he needs `just the facts`. ">vii</a></sup></p>
<p><b>Framedragger</b>	so x86 chips are broken and contain complex backdoor'y firmware. i should install malware, then?<br />
<b>Captain_Beezay</b>	a tool shouldn't tell me what to think or what to believe.<br />
<b>Riastradh</b>	Framedragger: Really not interested in arguing whether commentary around `the idea is to wholesale replace your notion of "professional"' is ideological proselytism.  It's off-topic here.<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b>	incidentally FUCKGOATS works fine with machines having no kernel, and no os in the customary sense. for instance, fpga that fills sd card with random, for onetimepad.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	Riastradh do you find this "hurr durr" "now please take your hurr durr somewhere else" approach works in general ?</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b>	Captain_Beezay "a tool" can't really work unless it comes with an ideology. that's what differentiates the tool from the piece of art.<br />
<b>sarnold</b>	mircea_popescu: in general people are more polite :)<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	there is that.<br />
<b>Riastradh</b>	My patience is running pretty thin, and it's normally quite thick.  If you folks have anything to discuss about crypto, feel free to bring it up; otherwise take it back to #trilema or whatever your usual haunt is.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	Riastradh i'd quote log lines if you have a log. as it is : "there's serious problems with it. such as, micro is under same shielding as rf amp." and "also, as per the schematic, the AP3105' switching voltage-booster is very likely to induce artefacts into the output." re the onerng thing.<br />
<b>sarnold</b>	asciilifeform: that's a fine point, and serial makes it way easier to use than usb too<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	sarnold the problem with soldering an usb down is also that usb is a pretty opaque cliquish thing one might find himself willing to jettison in this lifetime.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b>	incidentally, in case it were not obvious, mircea_popescu and asciilifeform are the co-authors of the linked device. and asciilifeform naively thought that a chan called 'crypto' might contain folks interested in the particulars of a (public design!) inexpensive nonwhitened rng.<br />
<b>sarnold</b>	asciilifeform: I think the mistake was mircea_popescu getting sucked into a debate about the name by Captain_Beezay. hehe. :)<br />
<b>sarnold</b>	asciilifeform: where a simple "that's name, name your own device whatever you want" would have sufficed. :)<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	mno, apparently $random-nobody<sup><a href="#footnote_7_72757" id="identifier_7_72757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The question is still open.

<p><b>Captain_Beezay</b>	mircea_popescu: in other words,I'd much rather be talking crypto or rng right now than ideology. I'd rather buy your work and use it,but if you made it for only people that have no problem being vulgar and profane and/or won't respect the preference of others to not speak about beastiality or in a profane way in a professional setting then it's certainly not<br />
<b>Captain_Beezay</b>	for me and I'll discourage anyone from using it based on that non-technical merit alone.<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b>	the name, apparently, is working quite well. exposes folks who have... issues<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	Captain_Beezay but by all means, go right ahead.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	the discussion is you saying "onerng exists" me explaining i see some problems, and now you discussing technology rather than anything else, please do.<sup><a href="#footnote_8_72757" id="identifier_8_72757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="You might be totally shocked by the fact that no, the fellow really had nothing else to say after all.">ix</a></sup></p>
<p><b>Riastradh</b>	Design of RNGs for crypto is on-topic, though physical phenomona that lead to them is at the edge of the topic of this channel -- not because it's irrelevant but because it lies outside the area of expertise in mathematical cryptography one expects to find here.<sup><a href="#footnote_9_72757" id="identifier_9_72757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="And we shall soon get a load of this expertise. I hope you have your Ito calculus at the ready.">x</a></sup><br />
<b>Captain_Beezay</b>	mircea_popescu: I can't even mention your rng without being profane,you have excluded me from it by calling it that. even if I liked your work I'd have to violate my beliefs in order to speak about it,very unfair. but I respect your right to name your work anything.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	you can just call it "FG" or for that matter anything else you wish. stet<sup><a href="#footnote_10_72757" id="identifier_10_72757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="No, this is not a mistake.

<p><b>mircea_popescu</b>	but anyway, since we're here : dieharder seems to spin over samples. this is (at least to my eyes) very strange behaviour, as it introduces artefacts in the extended "sample" it considers. anyone know either the author so i can ask him why or else can explain why ?<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	(other, of course, than the obvious "pre FG entropy samples were tiny and thus it was needed and besides they were so terribad it made little difference anyway.")</p>
<p><b>sarnold</b>	"spin over"?<br />
<b>Captain_Beezay</b>	mircea_popescu: forget about my little opinion,what if someone willing to audit your work or help you out doesn't because of something as silly as that. but I'll step away and allow other discussions<br />

<b>mircea_popescu</b>	andytoshi the whole point of it is being parallelizable yes ?<br />
<b>andytoshi</b>	mircea_popescu: right, "parallelizable" is not what i mean, what i mean is are there batch speedups<br />
<b>andytoshi</b>	like, for pollard-rho, a clasical algorithm, you can break 100 discrete logs in much less than 100 times as long as it takes 1<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b>	andytoshi: idea for shor's was to 'parallelize' by running on parallel universes.<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b>	(supposing anyone knew how.)<br />
<b>andytoshi</b>	asciilifeform: that's really not how shor's algorithm, or any quantum computation, works<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	the item not existing, this is entirely speculative, but in the theoretical theory of it you'd take the same local time to do 1 or n.<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b>	angels/pinhead.</p>
<p><b>Riastradh</b>	andytoshi: I don't think Shor's algorithm factors nicely into an expensive generic precomputation followed by a cheap per-target attack.  But since it would run so fast, I also don't think that's likely to matter.<br />
<b>Riastradh</b>	andytoshi: Why do you ask?<br />
<b>andytoshi</b>	Riastradh: because if you can break a lot of discrete logs (like 2^30) then wagner's generalized birthday attack becomes applicable in situations that it otherwise wouldn't be<br />
<b>andytoshi</b>	in particular if i give you an unlimited stream of uniformly random EC points, assuming DL is hard you won't be able to find a subset of them that sums to zero. but if you can break the DL of each point, then you can do this efficiently using wagner's algorithm<br />
<b>sarnold</b>	but isn't shor's algorithm itself closer to 2^16? or less?<br />
<b>andytoshi</b>	o.O is it really that low? for a 256-bit group?<br />
<b>Riastradh</b>	andytoshi: The cost of Shor's algorithm is roughly quadratic in the number of bits in the group in question.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	there's two parts. the fourier transform is supposed to be fast ; the exponentiation is supposedly slow.<br />
<b>andytoshi</b>	and the exponentiation is classical right?<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	doesn't have to be<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	but afaik that's the state of the art atm.<br />
<b>andytoshi</b>	i guess there's an implicit assumption that classical computers will have way higher clock speends that quantum computers<sup><a href="#footnote_15_72757" id="identifier_15_72757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I hope you're taking down all this mathematical expertise.

<b>mircea_popescu</b>	anyway, it bears pointing out that allegedly the largest factored number had about five digits ; more documented examples involve the factoring of number 15.<br />
<b>andytoshi</b>	heh, yeah, i'm not worried today, but i'm trying to design systems now with "how badly will a QC wreck this" mindset<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	heck, if you could get 1k "qbits" together you could prolly write the exponentiation as a fourrier transform.</p>
<p><b>andytoshi</b>	usually "QC will break everyone's privacy" is ok, but "QC will allow silent printing of bitcoins" is not<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	qc does not allow silent printing of bitcoins as it is.<sup><a href="#footnote_16_72757" id="identifier_16_72757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="You knew it was coming to this.">xvii</a></sup><br />
<b>andytoshi</b>	and when i'm actually concerned about quantum computers, i won't even be ok with privacy loss :)<br />
<b>andytoshi</b>	understood. but with confidential transactions it would<br />
<b>andytoshi</b>	we understand how to do unconditionally sound CT now ... i'm thinking about unconditionally sound confidential assets, which is a bit harder<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	this is altogether dubious. as far as bitcoin works today, in order to spend you must reference an extant transaction. no qc will help you make people's copies of the blockchain contain an inexistent transaction.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	spending other's bitcoins is a differenty problem from printing bitcoins on your own, and "silently" is yet another layer on that.<br />
<b>andytoshi</b>	yes, fine, i know. i'm not talking about the actual bitcoin system<br />
<b>bascule</b>	andytoshi: there are remarkably few problems where the ability to break 1 vs n discrete logs is helpful. I think I'm working on one of them... it's not exactly an area where that's something you want to formulate a defense around<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	ah ok.<br />
<b>andytoshi</b>	bascule: yeah, i think this is the first time i've ever encountered this being a useful distinction<br />
<b>andytoshi</b>	well, actually bitcoin (the real bitcoin :P) is kinda an example because there are a lot of public keys floating around that have money associated to them, and breaking any one of them lets you steal<br />
<b>andytoshi</b>	(though not silently, and not in an inflating way)<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	the bitcoin key scheme is a little more complex though. not just ec.<br />
<b>andytoshi</b>	yeah, agreed. most keys are not exposed like this because they aren't EC group keys<br />
<b>andytoshi</b>	it's only those that have been used before, and the underlying EC key exposed<br />
<b>bascule</b>	andytoshi: that's a multitarget attack... but that's a boring example of the property I'm talking about<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	in principle the address is a ripemd of a sha of the public key. but yes, you can also find the public key by finding previous txn spent from that address.</p>
<p><b>bascule</b>	sure each key you break provides incremental value<br />
<b>bascule</b>	that's different from "you have to break N discrete logs to break X"<br />
<b>andytoshi</b>	bascule: ah, true! i guess then my current problem is the first one i've encountered where "you have to break N discrete logs to break X" actually applies..<br />
<b>bascule</b>	because in the case of "you have to break N discrete logs" the question becomes "how big should N be?"<br />
<b>andytoshi</b>	well, in my case N is "big enough that Wagner's algorithm is tractable given all the discrete logs"<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	this entire discussion vaguely reminds me of a well known naggum piecew<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	http://www.xach.com/naggum/articles/3233532779857997@naggum.net.txt to be specific.<br />
<b>bascule</b>	mircea_popescu: haha the YAGNI argument<br />
<b>bascule</b>	funny thing about YAGNI<br />
<b>bascule</b>	the acronym swings both ways<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	not really how it reads to me.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	long before it becomes a discussion as to whether yagni or yangni, one has to be seated at the table, and that requires passing the more pressing fogotp<sup><a href="#footnote_17_72757" id="identifier_17_72757" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Fuck Or Get Off The Pig.">xviii</a></sup> <span style="background-color:#d3d3d3" id="select">caudine forks.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	dennis hopper does a great statement of that, if you've seen <a href="http://trilema.com/2013/search-and-destroy/#selection-65.1-67.23">seek and destroy</a>.<br />
<b>bascule</b>	mircea_popescu: I can't tell what that person is arguing<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	who ?<br />
<b>bascule</b>	but it sounds like "you aren't going to need it"<br />
<b>bascule</b>	o_O<br />
<b>bascule</b>	I'll give you three guesses, and the first two don't count<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	the matter isn't whether you are or aren't going to need it. before we get to that, we're stuck with "are you even going to be there".<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	that's what he's arguing : that you aren't even going to be there, to need anything or not need it.<br />
<b>bascule</b>	in 20/20 hindsight, this looks so very very quaint<br />
<b>bascule</b>	"The only applications I know of that require multiple<br />

<b>mircea_popescu</b>	you are aware that you're producing a circular argument, yes ?<br />
<b>bascule</b>	the gigantic paragraph of shit in the middle of the email is riddled with statements like that<br />
<b>bascule</b>	are you fucking kidding me?<br />
<b>bascule</b>	this email may be "I can't imagine a future where more than 1 out of 1000 humans will actually have a need for electrical power"<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	simply relabelling the imaginary work to be done from "reversing 20k wide matrix" to "blablaznarks" does not improve the standing of the child trying to fiddle with father's tools.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b>	so no, today as then, the only items actually needing gbs of memory also need tbs of disk space.<br />
