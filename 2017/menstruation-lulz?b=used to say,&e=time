What the fuck do I care she's bleeding under the wrap, or which specific hole is doing the bleeding ?
But to revisit briefly the `wtf do you do, eat it out of her` point -- yes it could be said that this is a killer argument in the pairs version of the sport, but somewhat of a disingenious argument in my case. I could just declare my semen sacred and mandate it's always eaten no matter where it ends up, right ? So then I ejaculate inside one, another eats it out of the fortunate, blessed oriffice and all's gravy, to borrow an inadequate expression that doesn't work well in context at all.
The limits to this approach come from the unfortunately peptic qualities of saliva. It's not great for your glans, though it's not terrible. It's certainly not great for the vagina (as distinct from the vulva!), and fishing out semen from a well fucked cunt is slow, difficult work. The cunt hides it! Don't ask me why -- it should be evident fucking why.

Because what is laughter, after all, if not the art of making someone <em>very</em> uncomfortable ?<sup><a href="#footnote_1_72562" id="identifier_1_72562" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="It is. Laughter as a group behaviour well predates speech, and unlike speech serves a single function and it serves it well : group formation and consolidation through exploiting the differences between the individuals. Every time we laugh at a fat girl we're not just helping her die a quicker, more painful death -- as fat girls deserve, by virtue of being fat girls -- but we also mark each other, for our individual  and each other's benefit, as members of that hallowed and most respectable group which recognizes evil and helps it on its merry way towards untimely, painful demise.

<p>Now consider an<a href="http://trilema.com/2017/the-story-of-monday/#footnote_1_72541"> enchanted place</a> where women are always naked.

<p>Obviously should this come to pass the misfortunate but well meaning and loving character will wash the cushion back into its original state (or fancy a cover replacement for the cover with her own two cute little hands -- though the incredible performances of the chemical industry to date rarely make this necessary). Among the sane this would also be the end of the story, but why be sane ?</p>
<p>You could treat the girl to a lecture as to the importance of holding in her liquor, old style, like respectable gents used to give to teenaged sons two centuries ago -- understanding but firm. You could even spell it "ichor" in speech, and then ask her to transcribe the word you said. She'll write down "liquor" if she's new, which will be funny. She'll <em>know</em> you did the speech spelling trick if she's experienced enough<sup><a href="#footnote_4_72562" id="identifier_4_72562" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Only takes a few years, what!">v</a></sup>, but she still won't fucking come up with ichor because who the fuck keeps <em>that</em> in their basic vocabulary <em>of a foreign language</em>, so she'll sit there <a href="http://trilema.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/signore-e-signori-buonanotte-3.jpg">vibrating in slavish agony</a>, and you get to mock her for being so anxious.</p>
<p>You could also forbid her the use of furniture for the remainder of her incontinent days, which is a lot greater a deal<sup><a href="#footnote_5_72562" id="identifier_5_72562" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The diagnosable, evident infirmity of modernity is that you at the same time immensely depend on artifice and, with the unearned panache of a great seigneur, pretend to the contrary.
