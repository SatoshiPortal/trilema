<p>I'll wager<sup><a href="#footnote_0_73530" id="identifier_0_73530" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="For most men, 'till by losing render'd sager, will back their own opinions with a wager.">i</a></sup> that you don't know Byron, at least not moreso than in the manner of that one true <a href="http://trilema.com/2010/literara-este-grea/#selection-253.0-252.7">Euterpe</a> of our colonies. Let us therefore indulge, captive audience squarely underfoot and superior firepower securely in hand, for why shouldn't we ?<br />
<font size=1></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">'Tis known, at least it should be, that throughout all countries of the Catholic persuasion,<br />
Some weeks before Shrove Tuesday comes about the people take their fill of recreation,<br />
And buy repentance, ere they grow devout, however high their rank, or low their station,<br />
With fiddling, feasting, dancing, drinking, masking, and other things which may be had for asking.<sup><a href="#footnote_1_73530" id="identifier_1_73530" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Specifically, cunt.">ii</a></sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The moment night with dusky mantle covers the skies (and the more duskily the better),<br />
The time less liked by husbands than by lovers begins, and prudery flings aside her fetter;<br />
And gaiety on restless tiptoe hovers, giggling with all the gallants who beset her;<br />
And there are songs and quavers, roaring, humming, guitars, and every other sort of strumming.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And there are dresses splendid, but fantastical, masks of all times and nations, Turks and Jews,<br />
And harlequins and clowns, with feats gymnastical, Greeks, Romans, Yankee-doodles, and Hindoos;<sup><a href="#footnote_2_73530" id="identifier_2_73530" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Third place. Hey, at least they beat the Indians, this time around.">iii</a></sup><br />
All kinds of dress, except the ecclesiastical, all people, as their fancies hit, may choose,<br />
But no one in these parts may quiz the clergy, — therefore take heed, ye Freethinkers! I charge ye.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But saving this, you may put on whate'er you like by way of doublet, cape, or cloak.<br />
Such as in Monmouth-street, or in Rag Fair, would rig you out in seriousness or joke;<br />
And even in Italy such places are, with prettier name in softer accents spoke,<br />
For, bating Covent Garden, I can hit on no place that's called "Piazza" in Great Britain.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This feast is named the Carnival, which being interpreted, implies "farewell to flesh:"<sup><a href="#footnote_3_73530" id="identifier_3_73530" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Quite literally : carne, vale!">iv</a></sup><br />
So call'd, because the name and thing agreeing, through Lent they live on fish, both salt and fresh.<br />
But why they usher Lent with so much glee in, is more than I can tell, although I guess<br />
'Tis as we take a glass with friends at parting, in the stage-coach or packet, just at starting,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And thus they bid farewell to carnal dishes, and solid meats, and highly spiced ragouts,<br />
To live for forty days on ill-dress'd fishes, because they have no sauces to their stews;<br />
A thing which causes many "poohs" and "pishes," and several oaths (which would not suit the Muse),<br />
From travellers accustom'd from a boy to eat their salmon, at the least, with soy;<sup><a href="#footnote_4_73530" id="identifier_4_73530" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I discover not without some surprise that my culinary habits have scarcely changed since the times they had actual Counts physically walking the land (as the case may have been, usually in search of credit).">v</a></sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And therefore humbly I would recommend "the curious in fish-sauce," before they cross<br />
The sea, to bid their cook, or wife, or friend, walk or ride to the Strand, and buy in gross<br />
(Or if set out beforehand, these may send by any means least liable to loss)<br />
Ketchup, Soy, Chili-vinegar, and Harvey, or by the Lord! a Lent will well nigh starve ye;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">That is to say, if your religion's Roman, and you at Rome would do as Romans do,<br />
According to the proverb, — although no man if foreign, is obliged to fast; and you<br />
If Protestant, or sickly, or a woman, would rather dine in sin on a ragout<sup><a href="#footnote_5_73530" id="identifier_5_73530" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="A holdout medieval dish -- very finely chopped meat, lots of spices, stewed with vegetables until paste.">vi</a></sup> —<br />
Dine and be damned! I don't mean to be coarse, but that's the penalty, to say no worse.<sup><a href="#footnote_6_73530" id="identifier_6_73530" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Not to mention in the slightest how it rhymes so very well.">vii</a></sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Of all the places where the Carnival was most facetious in the days of yore,<br />
For dance, and song, and serenade, and ball, and masque, and mime, and mystery, and more<br />
Than I have time to tell now, or at all, Venice the bell from every city bore, —<br />
And at the moment when I fix my story, That sea-born city was in all her glory.<sup><a href="#footnote_7_73530" id="identifier_7_73530" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="For some reason he seems to think the glory days of Venice were not in the 1400s.">viii</a></sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">They've pretty faces yet, those same Venetians, black-eyes, arch'd brows, and sweet expressions still;<br />
Such as of old were copied from the Grecians, in ancient arts by moderns mimick'd ill;<br />
And like so many Venuses of Titian's (The best's at Florence — see it, if ye will),<br />
They look when leaning over the balcony, or stepp'd from out a picture by Giorgione,<sup><a href="#footnote_8_73530" id="identifier_8_73530" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Apparently he is aware it was 1400s. Anyway, not exactly my cup -- especially Laura is terrifyingly hambeastly.
And speaking of the cultural supremacy of porn -- you will perhaps notice how sparsely fuckable apparitions are seen in classical paintings (made, say, before 1800, we're not counting the later masters in this sad lot).">ix</a></sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Whose tints are truth and beauty at their best; and when you to Manfrini's palace go,<br />
That picture (howsoever fine the rest) is loveliest to my mind of all the show;<br />
It may perhaps be also to your zest, and that's the cause I rhyme upon it so:<br />
'Tis but a portrait of his son, and wife, and self; but such a woman! love in life!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Love in full life and length, not love ideal, no, nor ideal beauty, that fine name,<br />
But something better still, so very real, that the sweet model must have been the same;<br />
A thing<sup><a href="#footnote_9_73530" id="identifier_9_73530" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="You see that ? A thing. The sentiment is strongly this, that had they had a way to get a car they very much would have had the car instead. 
For what else can you do, in that insane world where women aren't conventionally allowed to produce, nor live or even for that matter breathe at all ? You'll go insane, just as he did, a strange sort of inverse-pygmalion, a sad Midas cursed to turn any woman of flesh and blood he might touch into a marble statue thereof, all the while whining on a tinny note about `love real not ideal beauty` and so forth.
To add irony to misery, he even references the supposedly alien Othello. Remember always the sad fate of these barbarians, and never hold in any esteem the whore who tries to price herself out of the fucking.">x</a></sup> that you would purchase, beg, or steal, were 't not impossible, besides a shame:<br />
The face recalls some face, as't were with pain, you once have seen, but ne'er will see again.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">One of those forms which flit by us, when we are young, and fix our eyes on every face;<br />
And, oh! the loveliness at times we see in momentary gliding, the soft grace,<br />
The youth, the bloom, the beauty which agree, in many a nameless being we retrace,<br />
whose course, and home we knew not, nor shall know, like the lost Pleiad seen no more below.<sup><a href="#footnote_10_73530" id="identifier_10_73530" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="He is on to something here. Now imagine, in an argumentation line muchly similar to the drug discussion, what'd the world be like should fucking kids be opened up : those fixations fixed by fleeting apparition would instead be fixed by naive imprimation. Does the eventual necessary result sound healthy to your ear ?">xi</a></sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I said that like a picture by Giorgione Venetian women were, and so they are,<br />
Particularly seen from a balcony (for beauty's sometimes best set off afar),<br />
And there, just like a heroine of Goldoni, they peep from out the blind, or o'er the bar;<br />
And truth to say, they're mostly very pretty, and rather like to show it, more's the pity!<sup><a href="#footnote_11_73530" id="identifier_11_73530" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="For the record, and for the same reason, also never trust a man that even permits -- let alone encourages! -- his womenz dress modestly.">xii</a></sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For glances beget ogles, ogles sighs, sighs wishes, wishes words, and words a letter,<br />
Which flies on wings of light-heel'd Mercuries, who do such things because they know no better;<br />
And then, God knows what mischief may arise, when love links two young people in one fetter,<br />
Vile assignations, and adulterous beds, elopements, broken vows, and hearts, and heads.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Shakespeare described the sex in Desdemona as very fair, but yet suspect in fame<sup><a href="#footnote_12_73530" id="identifier_12_73530" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="`Look upon her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see -- she hath deceived her father, and one day thee.`">xiii</a></sup>,<br />
And to this day from Venice to Verona such matters may be probably the same,<br />
Except that since those times was never known a husband whom mere suspicion could inflame<br />
To suffocate a wife no more than twenty, because she had a "cavalier servente."<sup><a href="#footnote_13_73530" id="identifier_13_73530" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This is a very poor read of Shakespeare. Othello kills Desdemona because her confident dedication overwhelms him and for no other reason. The здреанца is incidental.">xiv</a></sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Their jealousy (if they are ever jealous) is of a fair complexion altogether,<br />
Not like that sooty devil of Othello's, which smothers women in a bed of feather,<br />
But worthier of these much more jolly fellows, when weary of the matrimonial tether<br />
His head for such a wife no mortal bothers, but takes at once another, or another's.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Didst ever see a Gondola? For fear you should not, I'll describe it you exactly:<br />
"Tis a long cover'd boat that's common here, carved at the prow, build lightly, but compactly,<br />
Row'd by two rowers, each call'd "Gondolier," it glides along the water looking blackly,<br />
Just like a coffin clapt in a canoe, where none can make out what you say or do.<sup><a href="#footnote_14_73530" id="identifier_14_73530" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="That ancient dream of the adolescent male, action without responsibility, deed without effect, existence bereft of its weight.
At least the adolescent has the excuse of the forced mistake, as his... gracile (let's call it) frame could not support much of anything anyway.">xv</a></sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And up and down the long canals they go, and under the Rialto shoot along,<br />
By night and day, all paces, swift or slow, and round the theatres, a sable throng,<br />
They wait in their dusk livery of woe, — but not to them do woeful things belong,<br />
For sometimes they contain a deal of fun<sup><a href="#footnote_15_73530" id="identifier_15_73530" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Here's a point easily missed by the mighty, by the wealthy, by the harem'd : throughout the history of this sad race, and perhaps still very much today, the practical consideration of where to do it overshadowed the more ideal concern of whom to do it with. Because no, you couldn't just bring a woman along to the front desk of a hotel in soviet lands and hire a room, they'd want to see your marriage certificate first. Nor could you simply have beds in your house in Venice, just like that. They had to be blessed by a priest, and had to have their paperwork in order, and evidently before there could be a bed there had to be someone who'd be sleeping in it first. And on and on.
To quote that woman in Kafka, `she got married to escape fucking in the bushes, and here she is yet again, fucked in the bushes`.">xvi</a></sup>, like mourning coaches when the funeral's done.<sup><a href="#footnote_16_73530" id="identifier_16_73530" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Funerals do in point of fact make those women that still ovulate quite horny, and they yet maidens most of all. Which is why the Irish drink.">xvii</a></sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But to my story. — 'Twas some years ago, it may be thirty, forty, more or less,<br />
The Carnival was at its height, and so were all kinds of buffoonery and dress;<br />
A certain lady went to see the show, her real name I know not, nor can guess,<br />
And so we'll call her Laura, if you please, because it slips into my verse with ease.<sup><a href="#footnote_17_73530" id="identifier_17_73530" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Giorgione's Laura certainly looks greasy enough to slip into anything with all the ease of blubber.">xviii</a></sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">She was not old, nor young, nor at the years which certain people call a "certain age,"<br />
Which yet the most uncertain age appears, because I never heard, nor could engage<br />
A person yet by prayers, or bribes, or tear, to name, define by speech, or write on page,<br />
The period meant precisely by that word, — which surely is exceedingly absurd.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Laura was blooming still, had made the best of time, and time return'd the compliment,<br />
She look'd extremely well where'er she went. A pretty woman is a welcome guest,<br />
And Laura's brow a frown had rarely bent. Indeed, she shone all smiles, and seem'd to flatter<br />
Mankind with her black eyes for looking at her.<sup><a href="#footnote_18_73530" id="identifier_18_73530" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="It was a work in progress, sketch for the later Don Juan, what do you want.">xix</a></sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">She was a married woman; 'tis convenient, because in Christian countries 'tis a rule<br />
To view their little slips with eyes more lenient; whereas if single ladies play the fool<br />
(Unless within the period intervenient a well-times wedding makes the scandal cool<sup><a href="#footnote_19_73530" id="identifier_19_73530" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="It's oft said, at least on these pages, that genius in art is told through the passage of time by that sure sign that howsoever the forms may change, the content remains, and well maintains its interest. What say you, then, of genius so profuse it actually foretells the very forms of folly a century into the future ?
Whatever you may say -- Byron was the first cool daddy-o, in 1817.">xx</a></sup>),<br />
I don't know how they ever can get over it, except they manage never to discover it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Her husband sail'd upon the Adriatic, and made some voyages, too, in other seas,<br />
And when he lay in quarantine for pratique (a forty days' precaution 'gainst disease),<br />
His wife would mount, at times, her highest attic, for thence she could discern the ship with ease;<br />
He was a merchant trading to Aleppo, his name Giuseppe, call'd more briefly, Beppo.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He was a man as dusky as a Spaniard<sup><a href="#footnote_20_73530" id="identifier_20_73530" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Moorish influence, you see.">xxi</a></sup>, sunburnt with travel, yet a portly figure;<br />
Though colour'd, as it were, within a tan-yard, he was a person both of sense<sup><a href="#footnote_21_73530" id="identifier_21_73530" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Because the expectation of the 1817 luminaries of the pantsuited crowd was that no dark skinned man would have any sense. As it turns out historical fact is a great disadvantage to a proper socialist worldview.">xxii</a></sup> and vigour —<br />
A better seaman never yet did man yard, and she, although her manners show'd no rigour,<br />
Was deem'd a woman of the strictest principle, so much as to be thought almost invincible.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But several years elapsed since they had met; some people thought the ship was lost, and some<br />
That he had somehow blunder'd into debt, and did not like the thought of steering home;<br />
And there were several offer'd any bet, or that he would, or that he would not come;<br />
For most men (till by losing render'd sager) will back their own opinions with a wager.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">'Tis said that their last parting was pathetic, as partings often are, or ought to be,<br />
And their presentiment was quite prophetic, that they should never more each other see,<br />
(A sort of morbid feeling, half poetic, which I have known occur in two or three,)<br />
When kneeling on the shore upon her sad knee he left this Adriatic Ariadne.<sup><a href="#footnote_22_73530" id="identifier_22_73530" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This is rather a tragic situation for the frownless girl to find herself in...">xxiii</a></sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And Laura waited long, and wept a little, and thought of wearing weeds, as well she might;<br />
She almost lost all appetite for victual, and could not sleep with ease along at night;<br />
She deem'd the window-frames and shutters brittle against a daring housebreaker or sprite,<br />
And so she thought it prudent to connect her<sup><a href="#footnote_23_73530" id="identifier_23_73530" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This is terrible.">xxiv</a></sup> with a vice-husband, chiefly to protect her.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">She chose, (and what is there they will not choose, if only you will but oppose their choice?)<br />
Till Beppo should return from his long cruise, and bid once more her faithful heart rejoice,<br />
A man some women like, and yet abuse — a coxcomb<sup><a href="#footnote_24_73530" id="identifier_24_73530" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="A cock's comb, from that land where cocks neigh.">xxv</a></sup> was he by the public voice;<br />
A Count of wealth, they said, as well as quality, and in his pleasures of great liberality.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And then he was A Count, and then he knew music, and dancing, fiddling, French and Tuscan;<br />
The last not easy, be it known to you. For few Italians speak the right Etruscan.<sup><a href="#footnote_25_73530" id="identifier_25_73530" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="You realise this, yes ? The Etruscans outlived the Latins ? Toscana is really and quite literally Etruria ? Etcetera ?">xxvi</a></sup><br />
He was a critic upon operas, too, and knew all niceties of the sock and buskin;<br />
And no Venetian audience could endure a song, scene, or air, when he cried "seccatura!"</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">His "bravo" was decisive, for that sound hush'd "Academie" sigh'd in silent awe;<br />
The fiddlers trembled as he look'd around, for fear of some false note's detected flaw;<br />
The "prima donna's" tuneful heart would bound, dreading the deep damnation of his "bah!"<br />
Soprano, basso, even the contra-alto, wish'd him five fathom under the Rialto.<sup><a href="#footnote_26_73530" id="identifier_26_73530" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Why do the inept always desire to destroy that which they fear ?">xxvii</a></sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He patronised the Improvisatori, nay, could himself extemporise some stanzas,<br />
Wrote rhymes, sang songs, could also tell a story, sold pictures, and was skilful in the dance as<br />
Italians can be, though in this their glory must surely yield the palm to that which France has;<br />
In short, he was a perfect cavaliero, and to his very valet seem'd a hero.<sup><a href="#footnote_27_73530" id="identifier_27_73530" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Incidentally, have you ever wondered why they never came up with the obvious genius move of employing women as valets ? I do, and I wouldn't trade a finely trained slavegirl for any Anthony Hopkins you could come up with. I don't dispute he's very good. I say she's always going to be better.">xxviii</a></sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Then he was faithful too, as well as amorous; so that no sort of female could complain,<br />
Although they're now and then a little clamourous, he never put the pretty souls in pain;<sup><a href="#footnote_28_73530" id="identifier_28_73530" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This is relatively rare, you know, lovers that do not break that many hearts. Casanova was big on the concept also, maybe they're on to something.">xxix</a></sup><br />
His heart was one of those which most enamour us, wax to receive, and marble to retain:<br />
He was a lover of the good old school, who still become more constant as they cool. </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">No wonder such accomplishments should turn a female head, however sage and steady —<br />
With scarce a hope that Beppo could return, in law he was almost as good as dead, he<br />
Nor sent, nor wrote, nor show'd the least concern, and she had waited several years already;<br />
And really if a man won't let us know that he's alive, he's dead, or should be so.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Besides, within the Alps, to every woman, (although, God knows, it is a grievous sin,)<br />
'Tis, I may say, permitted to have two men; I can't tell who first brought the custom in,<br />
But "Cavalier Serventes" are quite common, and no one notices nor cares a pin;<br />
And we may call this (not to say the worst) a second marriage which corrupts the first.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The word was formerly a "Cicisbeo," but that is now grown vulgar and indecent;<br />
The Spaniards call the person a "Cortejo," for the same mode subsists in Spain, though recent;<br />
In short, it reaches from the Po to Teio, and may perhaps at last be o'er the sea sent:<br />
But Heaven preserve Old England from such courses! Or what becomes of damage and divorces?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">However, I still think, with all due deference to the fair single part of the creation,<br />
That married ladies should preserve the preference in tête-à-tête or general conversation —<br />
And this I say without peculiar reference to England, France, or any other nation —<br />
Because they know the world, and are at ease, and being natural, naturally please.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Tis true, your budding Miss is very charming, but shy and awkward at first coming out,<br />
So much alarm'd, that she is quite alarming, all Giggle, Blush; half Pertness, and half-Pout;<br />
And glancing at Mamma, for fear there's harm in what you, she, it, or they, may be about,<br />
The nursery still lisps out in all they utter — besides, they always smell of bread and butter.<sup><a href="#footnote_29_73530" id="identifier_29_73530" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Nobody likes a virgin, or to more properly put it, nobody likes girls behaving as old women think they should. So don't.">xxx</a></sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But "Cavalier Servente" is the phrase used in politest circles to express<br />
This supernumerary slave, who stays close to the lady as a part of dress,<br />

Coach, servants, gondola, he goes to call, and carries fan and tippet, gloves and shawl.</p>

Who love to see the Sun shine every day, and vines (not nail'd to walls) from tree to tree<br />
Festoon'd, much like the back scene of a play, or melodrame, which people flock to see,<br />
When the first act is ended by a dance in vineyards copied from the south of France.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I like on Autumn evenings to ride out, without being forced to bid my groom be sure<br />
My cloak is round his middle strapp'd about, because the skies are not the most secure;<br />
I know too that, if stopp'd upon my route, where the green alleys windingly allure,<br />
Reeling with grapes red waggons choke the way, — in England 't would be dung, dust, or a dray.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I also like to dine on becaficas, to see the Sun set, sure he'll rise tomorrow,<br />
Not through a misty morning twinkling weak as a drunken man's dead eye in maudlin sorrow,<br />
But with all Heaven t'himself; the day will break as beauteous as cloudless, nor be forced to borrow<br />

And sounds as if it should be writ on satin, with syllables which breathe of the sweet South,<br />
And gentle liquids gliding all so pat in, that not a single accent seems uncouth,<br />
Like our harsh northern whistling, grunting guttural, which we're obliged to hiss, and spit, and sputter all.</p>

And large black eyes that flash on you a volley of rays that say a thousand things at once,<br />

Our little riots just to show we are free men, our trifling bankruptcies in the Gazette,<br />
Our cloudy climate, and our chilly women, all these I can forgive, and those forget,<br />
And greatly venerate our recent glories, and wish they were not owing to the Tories.</p>

Becomes exceeding tedious to my mind, and, therefore, may the reader too displease —<br />

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Count and Laura made their new arrangement, which lasted, as arrangements sometimes do,<br />
For half a dozen years without estrangement; they had their little differences, too;<br />
Those jealous whiffs, which never any change meant; in such affairs there probably are few<br />
Who have not had this pouting sort of squabble, from sinners of high station to the rabble.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But on the whole, they were a happy pair, as happy as unlawful love could make them;<br />
The gentleman was fond, the lady fair, their chains so slight, 'twas not worth while to break them;<br />
The world beheld them with indulgent air; the pious only wish'd "the devil take them!"<br />
He took them not; he very often waits, and leaves old sinners to be young ones' baits.<sup><a href="#footnote_34_73530" id="identifier_34_73530" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The strange conception of `sin` as fucking a woman you feel like fucking over her entirely absent objections.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But they were young: Oh! what without our youth would love be! What would youth be without love!<br />
Youth lends it joy, and sweetness, vigour, truth, heart, soul, and all that seems as from above;<br />
But, languishing with years, it grows uncouth — one of few things experience don't improve,<br />
Which is, perhaps, the reason why old fellows are always so preposterously jealous.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It was the Carnival, as I have said some six and thirty stanzas back, and so<br />
Laura the usual preparations made, which you do when your mind's made up to go<br />
To-night to Mrs. Boehm's masquerade, spectator, or partaker in the show;<br />
The only difference known between the cases is — here, we have six weeks of "varnish'd faces."</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">They went to the Ridotto; — 'tis a hall where people dance, and sup, and dance again;<br />
Its proper name, perhaps, were a masqued ball, but that's of no importance to my strain;<br />
'Tis (on a smaller scale) like our Vauxhall, excepting that it can't be spoilt by rain;<br />

Stopp'd by the elements, like a whaler, or a blundering novice in his new French grammar;<br />
Good cause had he to doubt the chance of war, and as for Fortune — but I dare not damn her,<br />
Because, were I to ponder to infinity, the more I should believe in her divinity.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">She rules the present, past, and all to be yet, she gives us luck in lotteries, love, and marriage;<br />
I cannot say that she's done much for me yet; Not that I mean her bounties to disparage,<br />
We've not yet closed accounts, and we shall see yet; How much she'll make amends for past miscarriage.<br />
Meantime the Goddess I'll no more importune, unless to thank her when she's made my fortune.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">To turn, — and return; — the devil take it! This story slips for ever through my fingers,<br />
Because, just as the stanza likes to make it, it needs must be, and so it rather lingers:<br />
This form of verse began, I can't well break it, but must keep time and tune like public singers;<br />
But if I once get through my present measure, I'll take another when I'm at leisure.</p>

Slackens its pace sometimes, I'll make, or find, something shall leave it half an hour behind).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Now Laura moves along the joyous crowd, smiles in her eyes, and simpers on her lips;<br />

Complains of warmth, and this complaint avow'd, her lover brings the lemonade, she sips;<br />

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">One has false curls, another too much paint, a third — where did she buy that frightful turban?<br />
A fourth's so pale she fears she's going to faint, a fifth's look's vulgar, dowdyish, and suburban,<br />
A sixth's white silk has got a yellow taint, a seventh's thin muslin surely will be her bane,<br />
And lo! an eighth appears, — "I'll see no more!" for fear, like Banquo's kings, they reach a score.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Meantime, while she was thus at others gazing, others were leveling their looks at her;<br />
She heard the men's half-whisper'd mode of praising, and, till 'twas done, determined not to stir;<br />
The women only thought it quite amazing that, at her time of life, so many were<br />
Admirers still, — but men are so debased, those brazen creatures always suit their taste.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For my part, now, I ne'er could understand why naughty women — but I won't discuss<br />
A thing which is a scandal to the land, I only don't see why it should be thus;<br />
And if I were but in a gown and band, just to entitle me to make a fuss,<br />
I'd preach on this till Wilberforce and Romilly should quote in their next speeches from my homily.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">While Laura thus was seen, and seeing, smiling, talking, she knew not why, and cared not what,<br />
So that her female friends, with envy broiling, beheld her airs and triumph, and all that;<br />
And well-dress'd males still kept before her filing, and passing bow'd and mingled with her chat;<br />
More than the rest one person seem'd to stare with pertinacity that's rather rare.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He was a Turk, the colour of mahogany; and Laura saw him, and at first was glad,<br />
Because the Turks so much admire phylogyny, although their usage of their wives is sad;<br />

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">They lock them up, and veil, and guard them daily, they scarcely can behold their male relations,<br />
So that their moments do not pass so gaily as is supposed the case with northern nations;<br />
Confinement, too, must make them look quite palely; and as the Turks abhor long conversations,<br />
Their days are either pass'd in doing nothing, or bathing, nursing, making love, and clothing.<sup><a href="#footnote_41_73530" id="identifier_41_73530" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The 1800s Turkish harem was actually a more comfortable, happier version of the English textile mill.

Ladies who have been dancing, or partaking in any other kind of exercise,<br />

And then I look'd (I hope it was no crime) to see what lady best stood out the season,<br />

More than that patent work of God's invention, a charming woman, whom we like to see;<br />
But writing names would merit reprehension, yet if you like to find out this fair she,<br />
At the next London or Parisian ball you still may mark her cheek out-blooming all.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Laura, who knew it would not do at all to meet the daylight after seven hours' sitting<br />
Among three thousand people at a ball, to make her curtsy thought it right and fitting;<br />
The Count was at her elbow with her shawl, and they the room were on the point of quitting,<br />
When lo! those cursed gondoliers had got just in the very place where they should not.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In this they're like our coachmen, and the cause is much the same — the crowd, and pulling, hauling,<br />
With blasphemies enough to break their jaws, they make a never intermitted bawling.<br />
At home, our Bow-street gemmen keep the laws, and here a sentry stands within your calling;<br />
But for all that, there is a deal of swearing, and nauseous words past mentioning or bearing.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Count and Laura found their boat at last, and homeward floated o'er the silent tide,<br />
Discussing all the dances gone and past; the dancers and their dresses, too, beside;<br />
Some little scandals eke; but all aghast (as to their palace-stairs the rowers glide)<br />
Sat Laura by the side of her Adorer, when lo! the Mussulman was there before her.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Sir," said the Count, with brow exceeding grave, "your unexpected presence here will make<br />
It necessary for myself to crave its import? But perhaps 'tis a mistake;<br />

Which saves much hartshorn, salts, and sprinkling faces, and cutting stays, as usual in such cases.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">She said, — what could she say? Why, not a word: but the Count courteously invited in<br />
The stranger, much appeased by what he heard: "Such things, perhaps, we'd best discuss within,"<br />
Said he; "don't let us make ourselves absurd in public, by a scene, nor raise a din,<br />
For then the chief and only satisfaction will be much quizzing on the whole transaction."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">They enter'd, and for coffee call'd — it came, a beverage for Turks and Christians both,<br />
Although the way they make it's not the same. Now Laura, much recover'd, or less loth<br />
To speak, cries "Beppo! what's your pagan name? Bless me! Your beard is of amazing growth!<br />

Why do you wear it? Oh! I had forgot — pray don't you think the weather here is colder?<br />
How do I look? You shan't stir from this spot in that queer dress, for fear that some beholder<br />
Should find you out, and make the story known. How short your hair is! Lord! How grey it's grown!"</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">What answer Beppo made to these demands is more than I know. He was cast away<br />
About where Troy stood once, and nothing stands; became a slave of course, and for his pay<br />
Had bread and bastinadoes, till some bands of pirates landing in a neighbouring bay,<br />
He join'd the rogues and prosper'd, and became a renegado of indifferent fame.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But he grew rich, and with his riches grew so keen the desire to see his home again,<br />
He thought himself in duty bound to do so, and not be always thieving on the main;<br />
Lonely he felt, at times, as Robin Crusoe, and so he hired a vessel come from Spain,<br />

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Himself, and much (Heaven knows how gotten!) cash, he then embark'd, with risk of life and limb<br />
And got clear off, although the attempt was rash; He said that Providence protected him —<br />
For my part, I say nothing — lest we clash in our opinions: — well, the ship was trim,<br />
Set sail, and kept her reckoning fairly on, except three days of calm when off Cape Bonn.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">They reach'd the island, he transferr'd his lading and self and live stock to another bottom,<br />
And pass'd for a true Turkey-merchant, trading with goods of various names, but I've forgot'em.<br />
However, he got off by this evading, or else the people would perhaps have shot him;<br />
And thus at Venice landed to reclaim his wife, religion, house, and Christian name.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">His wife received, the patriarch re-baptised him (he made the church a present, by the way);<br />
He then threw off the garments which disguised him, and borrow'd the Count's small clothes for a day:<br />
His friends the more for his long absence prized him, finding he'd wherewithal to make them gay,<br />
With dinners, where he oft became the laugh of them, for stories — but I don't believe the half of them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Whate'er his youth had suffer'd, his old age with wealth and talking made him some amends;<br />
Though Laura sometimes put him in a rage, I've heard the Count and he were always friends.<br />
My pen is at the bottom of a page, which being finish'd, here the story ends;<br />
'Tis to be wish'd it had been sooner done, but stories somehow lengthen when begun.<br />
