		<description>There's a number of different things in there.

First off, there's two aspects to money. Money is on some level &lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2014/the-bezzle-usd-and-the-tide-usd/"&gt;an immediate necessity&lt;/a&gt;, allowing human life to distinguish itself from mere animal, providing for necessary luxuries such as hot water for one's women so they're pleasant fucktoys as opposed to outright beastly and toys for one's children such that they're fun to have around and watch growing up as opposed to outright beastly and so following. Money is on another, perhaps its true or fundamental level &lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2014/that-aint-the-maslow-pyramid-yo/?b=Social&#038;e=domination#select"&gt;a manifestation of social pre-eminence&lt;/a&gt;, an elaborately elegant mechanism for the enslaving of Hegel/Husserl's "Other", for its rendering out of the obnoxious chaos that spawned it in the first place along a golden chain towards... well, childhood and thereupon feminity, useful subservience in a word. (Which is also why self-castration as proposed by Levinas&#038;co is such poisonous nonsense. There can never be &lt;em&gt;any kind&lt;/em&gt; of Other-superiority, not in fact &lt;em&gt;nor even potentially&lt;/em&gt;.)

Depending which of these two interests you the strategy involved will be derived off the two available possibilities : if what you want is Money (n), you will have to identify in your accessible environment your available Master, and kneel before it. Whether you live in &lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2018/the-principal-agent-problem-or-how-america-went-away/?b=You%20understand%20what%20this&#038;e=preserve#select"&gt;the decrepit land&lt;/a&gt; of "corporations" or in the barbaric lands of Pashtun warlords, your strategy for M(n) consists of finding your &lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2015/why-representative-democracy-doesnt-work-and-doesnt-make-sense/?b=Men&#038;e=in%20charge#select"&gt;Pater familias&lt;/a&gt; and being &lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2019/so-why-cant-they-be-trained/#footnote_0_83023"&gt;its client&lt;/a&gt;. If what you want is Money (p), you will have to identify in your accessible environment the monetizable differential, and monetize it. Whether you're a Florentine merchant sailing for spices and golden fruit aka pomodori or &lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2016/to-the-dao-and-the-ethereum-community-fuck-you/"&gt;me putting the hurt on idiots&lt;/a&gt;, your strategy for M(p) consists of breaking "the law", absolutely in spirit if not necessarily in form, because that's what breaking the surroundant imbeciles out of their comfort &lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2013/the-bitchslapping-of-2013/#comment-92367"&gt;always reduces to&lt;/a&gt;.

Investment in particular is unrelated to either kind of making money. Investment is a manner of making friends, which is why J P Morgan is quoted &lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2013/why-i-nixed-p2p-colored-coins-and-all-that-jazz/?b=words%20of&#038;e=Morgan#select"&gt;exactly once&lt;/a&gt; on Trilema : that's the once he had a point. The complete discussion of financial investment in the present socialism is still embodied in &lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2017/the-universal-plan-for-wealth/"&gt;The Universal Plan for Wealth&lt;/a&gt;, and there it will remain (much like the complete discussion of personal investment in the present socialism is found in &lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2015/strategy-for-the-antisocial-struggle/"&gt;Strategy for the antisocial struggle&lt;/a&gt; etcetera). There is no possiblity nor any venue available to make friends, there's no point in attempting to discuss anything with the "&lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2018/the-retards-handshake/"&gt;this is our policy&lt;/a&gt;" idiots &lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2016/theyre-not-progressive-theyre-just-lazy-a-practical-exercise/?b=Who%20knows&#038;e=patriarchy#select"&gt;scattered about&lt;/a&gt;, therefore not playing is the only winning move. (And therefore qualifiers and discriminants &lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2019/usta-swingers-club-ul-jozefa-strusia-5-in-warsaw-poland-and-other-things/#footnote_4_87077"&gt;such as I use&lt;/a&gt;, to certify one is in fact a human being and part of human society, as opposed to mere spawn of subhuman misery.)

Finally, there's a reason I don't particularly mind answering questions. It comes quite readily to me, on the strength of... all the equipment laying about, that I've either made myself or otherwise acquired. It makes impossible tasks trivial, and various problems others encounter not even capable of being problems, for me. Wealth, you know, is a lot more and plenty besides &lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2010/sunteti-besini/?b=Iar%20in&#038;e=mereu#select"&gt;merely having&lt;/a&gt; a lot of money, or otherwise lottery winners would be &lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2016/the-story-of-elliot-rodger-by-elliot-rodger-adnotated-part-eight/?b=meditating&#038;e=room#select"&gt;the happiest people on Earth&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

		<description>Hello, this is probably an annoying question and one you get a lot, but seeing someone as successfull and smart as you, all I want to ask is if you have any tips on how to make money right now in general/what assets to invest in? I believe that most people just work their asses off, spend all their money every month on rent and all their other personal needs and never consider on investing or trying anything ambitious, because they don't know/ don't think it will work out and don't have the time for it and that's why they finish just about where they started. I don't want to end up like that, but I need to obtain more knowledge and I know that, but right now, I just want to use the opportunity you give to readers of your blog like myself and ask for your advice because I am sure that someone as successful as you, would be able to give me guidance rather than a specific straight-forward answer/solution if you don't really have one. 
Thank you for your time and I really do enjoy reading through your blog!</description>
