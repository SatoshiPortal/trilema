<p><em>I'm publishing this mostly because the ridiculous pretense of the participants is so over the top it seems worth preserving for future disbelieving generations. Preteens playing at the real world doesn't even begin to describe it, this stuff really belongs behind the bleachers.</p>
<p>I do happen know the names of the "anonymous" shareholders (and in many cases their place of residence, in <em>much</em> fewer cases place of employment and so forth, much like I knew what GLBBQ balance sheets looked like back in March) but I can't be bothered to fill it in. </p>

[16:22:40] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> thank you sirs.<br />
[16:22:45] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> Nef you're up.<br />
[16:22:51] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> make it good.<br />
[16:22:59] <strong>nefario</strong> present, GLBSE is down<br />
[16:23:01] <strong>nefario</strong> the future<br />
[16:23:06] <strong>nefario</strong> GLBSE is staying down<br />
[16:23:11] <strong>nefario</strong> closing it's doors<br />
[16:23:24] <strong>nefario</strong> and returning bitcoin to our users<br />
[16:23:52] <strong>nefario</strong> and providing where possible issers and asset holders the ability to continue their relationships without us<br />
[16:24:08] <strong>nefario</strong> clear enough?<br />
[16:24:14] <strong>shareholder2</strong> no<br />
[16:24:21] <strong>shareholder2</strong> the why's?<br />
[16:24:22] <strong>shareholder1</strong> if its like goats codes its unnacceptable.<br />
[16:24:23] <strong>theymos</strong> I can't imagine any case where that would be the best option. Sell GLBSE, at least.<br />
[16:24:31] <strong>shareholder4</strong> is that all?<br />
[16:24:46] <strong>nefario</strong> firstly, I can't really talk about the details<br />
[16:24:50] <strong>shareholder3</strong> explain in detail why you came to this conlclusion, nef<br />
[16:24:59] <strong>nefario</strong> that would certainly not be in my best interests<br />
[16:25:04] <strong>shareholder2</strong> you'll have to if you want us to support it<br />
[16:25:15] <strong>nefario</strong> no<br />
[16:25:17] <strong>nefario</strong> I wont<br />
[16:25:22] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i believe we have the ability to keep things private<br />
[16:25:38] <strong>nefario</strong> I don't think so<br />
[16:25:42] <strong>shareholder2</strong> since we as shareholders are directly affected as well if there is legal trouble<br />
[16:25:44] <strong>nefario</strong> but I'll say a few things<br />
[16:25:51] <strong>nefario</strong> what MY problem actually is<br />
[16:25:54] <strong>nefario</strong> 1)<br />
[16:25:58] <strong>shareholder3</strong> so what do you mean with  "providing where possible issers and asset holders the ability to continue their relationships without us"<br />
[16:26:00] <strong>nefario</strong> AML<br />
[16:26:01] <strong>nefario</strong> 2)<br />
[16:26:03] <strong>nefario</strong> tax<br />
[16:26:05] <strong>nefario</strong> 3)<br />
[16:26:07] <strong>nefario</strong> regulations<br />
[16:26:09] <strong>nefario</strong> in that order<br />
[16:26:16] <strong>shareholder2</strong> and you suddenly found out about that yesterday?<br />
[16:26:19] <strong>chrisrico</strong> is this not all stuff that you knew would be problems going into this venture?<br />
[16:26:31] <strong>nefario</strong> no<br />
[16:26:45] <strong>nefario</strong> when GLBSE was started everything was a grey area<br />
[16:26:46] <strong>nefario</strong> and<br />
[16:26:48] <strong>nefario</strong> since that time<br />
[16:26:53] <strong>nefario</strong> the goalposts have moved<br />
[16:27:02] <strong>chrisrico</strong> when did that happen, and what moved them?<br />
[16:27:03] <strong>nefario</strong> what was a toy stock exchange using a toy currency<br />
[16:27:17] <strong>nefario</strong> became something that has attracted the attention of a lot of<br />
[16:27:20] <strong>nefario</strong> groups<br />
[16:27:29] <strong>nefario</strong> now<br />
[16:27:30] <strong>shareholder4</strong> to be fair you were all "black market" then<br />
[16:27:36] <strong>nefario</strong> yes<br />
[16:27:37] <strong>nefario</strong> and it was fun<br />
[16:27:40] <strong>nefario</strong> lots of fun<br />
[16:27:45] <strong>nefario</strong> but it wasn't serious<br />
[16:27:48] <strong>chrisrico</strong> with our money...<br />
[16:27:55] <strong>theymos</strong> BitcoinGlobal is not based the UK. If you're in the UK and laws prevent you from performing your duties as CEO, you'll need to resign...<br />
[16:27:55] <strong>nefario</strong> the amounts involved were negligable<br />
[16:28:02] <strong>nefario</strong> or however you spell the word<br />
[16:28:11] <strong>shareholder2</strong> exactly what theymos says<br />
[16:28:17] <strong>nefario</strong> theymos, why dont you resign<br />
[16:28:36] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i believe he wanted to<br />
[16:28:37] <strong>shareholder1</strong> hes not the ceo<br />
[16:28:37] <strong>nefario</strong> you're full of shit<br />
[16:28:52] <strong>chrisrico</strong> nefario, do you believe that you are acting in all of our best interests by shutting down GLBSE? or merely your own?<br />
[16:28:55] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> civil gents<br />
[16:29:17] <strong>theymos</strong> I've done my duties as treasuruer. I wish I would have gotten out of GLBSE before this mess, but you ruined the share price...<br />
[16:29:31] <strong>nefario</strong> chrisrico: depends on what you think GLBSE's best interest is<br />
[16:29:38] <strong>nefario</strong> what is the goal of GLBSE?<br />
[16:29:44] <strong>theymos</strong> Make money for shareholders.<br />
[16:29:48] <strong>shareholder2</strong> serve its shareholders<br />
[16:29:48] <strong>shareholder4</strong> nefario: so you're basically saying this is going bad for me so we all shut down and stfu?<br />
[16:29:52] <strong>nefario</strong> ja<br />
[16:29:54] <strong>nefario</strong> now<br />
[16:30:06] <strong>nefario</strong> does that include going to jail for doing so or being involved<br />
[16:30:19] <strong>shareholder1</strong> you should let us operate it under a different name and jurisdiction<br />
[16:30:23] <strong>chrisrico</strong> if you don't want to be involved, that's fine, you can step down<br />
[16:30:34] <strong>theymos</strong> No one has ever forced you to do anything.<br />
[16:30:37] <strong>nefario</strong> ok<br />
[16:30:39] <strong>nefario</strong> so<br />
[16:30:44] <strong>nefario</strong> let me tell you what is going to happen<br />
[16:31:00] <strong>nefario</strong> GLBSE.com is now down<br />
[16:31:16] <strong>nefario</strong> and will stay that way<br />
[16:31:29] <strong>nefario</strong> users will be able to get all their BTC back<br />
[16:31:39] <strong>nefario</strong> when they submit proof of ID<br />
[16:31:44] <strong>shareholder1</strong> oh god<br />
[16:31:45] <strong>nefario</strong> same with issuers<br />
[16:31:46] <strong>theymos</strong> lol<br />
[16:31:51] <strong>shareholder2</strong> hahahaha<br />
[16:32:03] <strong>shareholder4</strong> omg<br />
[16:32:08] <strong>nefario</strong> and<br />
[16:32:36] <strong>chrisrico</strong> are you planning on executing this plan with or without our approval?<br />
[16:32:52] <strong>nefario</strong> I don't need your approval for this, I don't have much choice<br />
[16:32:56] <strong>theymos</strong> I don't think so. I still have 1400 BTC of treasury funds, including part of user deposits. You will be unable to pay all users.<br />
[16:33:08] <strong>shareholder1</strong> ^^<br />
[16:33:11] <strong>nefario</strong> ColdHardMetal, you need to send me all the verification info that you're holding on issuers you've verified<br />
[16:33:19] <strong>shareholder1</strong> no he doesnt<br />
[16:33:24] <strong>shareholder2</strong> no cooperation without information<br />
[16:33:26] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> I'd really rather it didn't g like that theymos<br />
[16:33:31] <strong>shareholder1</strong> you are now dangerous<br />
[16:33:38] <strong>nefario</strong> me?<br />
[16:34:03] <strong>chrisrico</strong> nefario: why can't you just turn over all access to us and step away from the project?<br />
[16:34:22] <strong>shareholder4</strong> ok, so you're scared and you want out really quick<br />
[16:34:28] <strong>nefario</strong> me?<br />
[16:34:32] <strong>nefario</strong> out quick?<br />
[16:34:35] <strong>nefario</strong> there is no out<br />
[16:34:38] <strong>nefario</strong> there is over<br />
[16:34:58] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i don't know who said it's over, you still haven't told us anything<br />
[16:35:02] <strong>shareholder4</strong> well you know there are other people involved<br />
[16:35:20] <strong>nefario</strong> I am limited in what I can tell you<br />
[16:35:26] <strong>chrisrico</strong> by UK law?<br />
[16:35:34] <strong>nefario</strong> I'm not a lawyer<br />
[16:35:35] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> Have you actually been contacted by regulators?<br />
[16:35:52] <strong>chrisrico</strong> then why do you say you are limited in what you can tell this? are you currently in legal trouble?<br />
[16:35:57] <strong>nefario</strong> but the one who is representing me has said that I shouldn't say much<br />
[16:36:08] <strong>chrisrico</strong> representing you against...?<br />
[16:36:10] <strong>shareholder1</strong> you are operating in bad faith<br />
[16:36:13] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> representing you to who?<br />
[16:36:50] <strong>nefario</strong> ask another question<br />
[16:36:55] *** shareholder3_ joined the channel<br />
[16:37:06] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> present again<br />
[16:37:14] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> got kicked out<br />
[16:37:15] <strong>chrisrico</strong> you know this is bullshit, right?<br />
[16:37:24] <strong>nefario</strong> is it?<br />
[16:37:29] *** shareholder3 Quit IRC (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)<br />
[16:37:43] <strong>shareholder4</strong> I understand your situation and respect your privacy, but you can't decide for everyone else here<br />
[16:37:49] <strong>chrisrico</strong> yes, that you are acting against us and the bylaws for your own benefit<br />
[16:38:08] <strong>nefario</strong> so the bylaws<br />
[16:38:35] <strong>chrisrico</strong> in what manner does your plan protect you that stepping away from this project completely would not?<br />
[16:38:36] <strong>shareholder2</strong> yes, this is BS<br />
[16:38:49] <strong>shareholder2</strong> your shareholders deserve the full picture<br />
[16:39:11] <strong>nefario</strong> theymos:I believe that BitcoinGlobal is legally a non-entity and each individual  is liable only for his own actions. No one signed the bylaws or any  partnership contract.<br />
[16:39:22] <strong>nefario</strong> thats an interesting<br />
[16:39:24] <strong>shareholder1</strong> if you are no longer associated with anything and glbse is a different name and jurisdiction there is nothing you can do.<br />
[16:39:32] <strong>nefario</strong> perspective for a "shareholder" to have<br />
[16:39:56] <strong>chrisrico</strong> nefario: in what manner does your plan protect you that stepping away from this project completely would not?<br />
[16:40:24] <strong>nefario</strong> because what has happened has already happened and stepping away would not change that<br />
[16:40:27] <strong>shareholder1</strong> I imagine handing over all user data to the feds would help<br />
[16:40:35] <strong>chrisrico</strong> but you cannot tell us what has happened?<br />
[16:40:38] <strong>theymos</strong> nefario: _legally_ a non-entity. Bylaws are enforced by the community. You won't be able to work in the Bitcoin community ever again if you break the bylaws.<br />
[16:40:49] <strong>shareholder1</strong> ^^<br />
[16:40:58] <strong>da2ce796</strong> shareholder2, theymos, et'all nefario will say as much as he feals conftable in saying... we cannot force him to say anything more<br />
[16:41:10] <strong>shareholder4</strong> nefario: didnt your lawyer say the bylaws are actually legally binding?<br />
[16:41:19] <strong>shareholder4</strong> like two weeks ago?<br />
[16:41:41] <strong>da2ce796</strong> theymos: you don't hold GLBSE's funds, but rarther people who use GLBSE's funds.<br />
[16:42:10] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder4: legally binding in as much as they don't contravine the law, you can't use the bylaws as an excuse to make me do something illegal<br />
[16:42:26] <strong>shareholder2</strong> nefario: you have been acting quite erratic and leaving us in the dark ever since the conference<br />
[16:42:31] <strong>chrisrico</strong> are you saying that doing anything but shutting down GLBSE against our wishes would be illegal for you?<br />
[16:42:50] <strong>chrisrico</strong> have you received a court order to shut down GLBSE?<br />
[16:43:01] <strong>shareholder2</strong> it would cost us a lot of money, i believe we deserve to know what exactly happened<br />
[16:43:01] <strong>shareholder1</strong> nefario why should you habndle the shutdown and not theymos and CHM<br />
[16:43:35] <strong>shareholder2</strong> you can always retreit from GLBSE and every association to it<br />
[16:43:36] <strong>nefario</strong> well theymos could do it, but he'd need to send his proof of ID to me<br />
[16:43:50] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder2: did you not read what I said<br />
[16:43:57] <strong>nefario</strong> what has happened has already happened<br />
[16:44:02] <strong>nefario</strong> as long as GLBSE exists<br />
[16:44:05] <strong>chrisrico</strong> yet you withhold that information from us<br />
[16:44:10] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> Nefario, you need to help us a little bit with more background. I dont see why you can just say what has happened in the background over the past 1-2 weeks<br />
[16:44:11] <strong>shareholder2</strong> no. what has happned?<br />
[16:44:11] <strong>nefario</strong> the history is still there<br />
[16:44:14] <strong>chrisrico</strong> and expect us to go along with you<br />
[16:44:46] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> I dont see why you can't just say what has happened in the background over the past 1-2 weeks<br />
[16:44:46] <strong>nefario</strong> I'm worried about 1)AML, 2)Tax 3) Regulations in that order<br />
[16:44:55] <strong>shareholder1</strong> are they gonna blame you if at some point a new stock exchange opens that has nothing to do with glbse<br />
[16:45:01] <strong>nefario</strong> GLBSE has been running for 1 and 1/2 years<br />
[16:45:04] <strong>shareholder2</strong> just "worried"? or has the FSA knocked at your doorstep?<br />
[16:45:07] <strong>chrisrico</strong> shareholder3_: HIS lawyer has advised him not to give us any information<br />
[16:45:11] <strong>nefario</strong> and we've not done AML<br />
[16:45:13] <strong>chrisrico</strong> nefario: can we speak with your lawyer?<br />
[16:45:14] <strong>shareholder2</strong> because you are "worried" you shut everything down suddenly?<br />
[16:45:21] <strong>shareholder2</strong> and you haven't thought of that before?<br />
[16:45:27] <strong>shareholder4</strong> so, if you step down you won't be worreid anymore<br />
[16:45:32] <strong>da2ce796</strong> I for one can understand where nefario is coming from, when you think the hell-hounds of the state have got a snith of your blood, then you will do almost anytihng to cover you ass.<br />
[16:45:43] <strong>shareholder1</strong> ^^^<br />
[16:45:46] <strong>da2ce796</strong> overall the blam shouldn't be no nefario, but the UK laws.<br />
[16:45:53] <strong>nefario</strong> look<br />
[16:45:55] <strong>shareholder4</strong> da2ce796: yes<br />
[16:45:56] <strong>nefario</strong> the fact is<br />
[16:46:00] <strong>nefario</strong> GLBSE as it currently is<br />
[16:46:03] <strong>nefario</strong> is illegal<br />
[16:46:07] <strong>shareholder2</strong> we never agreed to run it from the UK<br />
[16:46:15] <strong>nefario</strong> EVERYWHERE<br />
[16:46:27] <strong>nefario</strong> I LIVE IN THE UK<br />
[16:46:31] <strong>shareholder2</strong> so mpex is illegal as well?<br />
[16:46:33] <strong>nefario</strong> or if not there then somewhere else<br />
[16:46:41] <strong>nefario</strong> hell yes<br />
[16:46:43] <strong>shareholder4</strong> nefario: yes, but who gives you the authority to shut it down?<br />
[16:47:00] <strong>shareholder2</strong> ok. good you discovered that and reduced our shares to 0 value<br />
[16:47:03] <strong>da2ce796</strong> shareholder4: who gives the state the authorty to make it illigal?<br />
[16:47:19] <strong>chrisrico</strong> shareholder4: basically, because he can, it's in his best interest, and his lawyer advised him to<br />
[16:47:25] <strong>shareholder4</strong> da2ce796: that's not the point<br />
[16:47:25] <strong>chrisrico</strong> and/or he was ordered to do so by a court<br />
[16:47:27] <strong>shareholder1</strong> ^^^<br />
[16:47:34] <strong>shareholder2</strong> if it's a court, i would understand<br />
[16:47:39] <strong>nefario</strong> let me answer shareholder4<br />
[16:47:45] <strong>nefario</strong> chill for a second guys<br />
[16:47:50] <strong>shareholder1</strong> hes being lent on to gather as much user data as possible<br />
[16:48:01] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder1: no thats not it<br />
[16:48:04] <strong>shareholder2</strong> if it's just he is "worried" because of talking to a lawyer, i do not understand shutting down everything and requesting IDs<br />
[16:48:08] <strong>nefario</strong> shut up for a minute<br />
[16:48:11] <strong>nefario</strong> and let me talk<br />
[16:48:15] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder4<br />
[16:48:19] <strong>nefario</strong> I started and ran GLBSE<br />
[16:48:29] <strong>nefario</strong> bought all the servers and stuff etc. using my card<br />
[16:48:34] <strong>nefario</strong> I'm the face of GLBSE<br />
[16:48:55] <strong>nefario</strong> this also means that I get fucked for GLBSE's mistakes<br />
[16:49:16] <strong>nefario</strong> so to answer shareholder4's question<br />
[16:49:37] <strong>shareholder1</strong> wtf did you not use bitcoin ?<br />
[16:49:45] <strong>theymos</strong> You used shareholder money to start GLBSE and paid yourself ~250 BTC per month plus 24% of dividends. GLBSE belongs to the shareholders much more than it belongs to you.<br />
[16:50:03] <strong>nefario</strong> I WAS THE LARGEST INVESTOR OF GLBSE<br />
[16:50:06] <strong>shareholder2</strong> so let's change the face if our face suddenly got worried after 1 1/2 years and decided to close it down on a whim and request IDs<br />
[16:50:15] <strong>shareholder2</strong> nope<br />
[16:50:20] <strong>shareholder2</strong> we were larger than you together<br />
[16:50:32] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder2: re-read what I said<br />
[16:50:38] <strong>chrisrico</strong> you were the largest single investor, yes, but that doesn't mean much of anything<br />
[16:50:43] <strong>shareholder2</strong> just saying you do not own it<br />
[16:50:50] <strong>nefario</strong> I didn't say I owned it<br />
[16:51:05] <strong>shareholder2</strong> ok. then retreat and let us handle things as we see fit<br />
[16:51:12] <strong>nefario</strong> not possible<br />
[16:51:16] <strong>shareholder2</strong> why?<br />
[16:51:18] <strong>shareholder4</strong> but you're willing to end something you dont own<br />
[16:51:22] <strong>shareholder2</strong> that's the core<br />
[16:51:26] <strong>nefario</strong> because I'm already on the hook for what has happened<br />
[16:51:27] <strong>shareholder2</strong> why is that not possible?<br />
[16:51:34] <strong>nefario</strong> to date<br />
[16:51:39] <strong>chrisrico</strong> nefario: will closing GLBSE down take you off the hook?<br />
[16:52:04] <strong>chrisrico</strong> if so, this sounds like some sort of plea bargain?<br />
[16:52:19] <strong>nefario</strong> we don't have plea bargains in the UK<br />
[16:52:23] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i simply want to know: are you only "worried" and decided to do it on your own, or are you actively being forced by the FSA?<br />
[16:52:29] <strong>shareholder1</strong> oops someone leaked to gp\lbse codebase and registered a server using bitcoin lol<br />
[16:52:46] <strong>theymos</strong> Yeah. We'd have to advise users that Nefario might be collecting IDs for the government.<br />
[16:52:53] <strong>shareholder1</strong> yep<br />
[16:52:58] <strong>nefario</strong> theymos: you wont<br />
[16:53:02] <strong>theymos</strong> I will.<br />
[16:53:04] <strong>nefario</strong> I'll anounce it<br />
[16:53:15] <strong>shareholder2</strong> nefario: please answer my question<br />
[16:53:33] <strong>nefario</strong> re-phrase your question<br />
[16:54:00] <strong>shareholder2</strong> did you just consult with your lawyer and he advised you to do this, or is there an active order by the government agencies?<br />
[16:54:47] <strong>nefario</strong> I can't answer that question<br />
[16:54:57] <strong>shareholder2</strong> then it's all kind of useless<br />
[16:54:58] <strong>chrisrico</strong> so then there's an active order by a government agency<br />
[16:55:01] <strong>nefario</strong> regarding the GLBSE code base<br />
[16:55:06] <strong>shareholder2</strong> yeah, ok<br />
[16:55:20] <strong>nefario</strong> I don't think there is any problem selling it onward<br />
[16:55:26] <strong>shareholder1</strong> genjix is good aat leaking stuff lol<br />
[16:55:37] <strong>shareholder1</strong> :P<br />
[16:55:39] <strong>nefario</strong> doesn't have to be leaked<br />
[16:55:42] <strong>theymos</strong> I move that Nefario be removed as CEO and ordered to return control of GLBSE's assets to shareholders. (He probably won't do it, but then he'll be clearly in violation of the bylaws and we'll be off the hook according to the community.)<br />
[16:55:44] <strong>nefario</strong> can be straight up sold<br />
[16:55:54] <strong>shareholder1</strong> seconded<br />
[16:55:55] <strong>chrisrico</strong> I second the motion<br />
[16:55:59] <strong>shareholder2</strong> theymos: i second<br />
[16:56:08] <strong>nefario</strong> I vote against this<br />
[16:56:14] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> motion made and seconded. all those in favor?<br />
[16:56:18] <strong>theymos</strong> Aye.<br />
[16:56:18] <strong>chrisrico</strong> aye<br />
[16:56:21] <strong>shareholder2</strong> yes<br />
[16:56:22] <strong>shareholder1</strong> aye<br />
[16:56:24] <strong>da2ce796</strong> -<br />
[16:56:27] <strong>shareholder4</strong> aye<br />
[16:56:42] <strong>nefario</strong> I vote against<br />
[16:56:57] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> aye, as long as this leads to a solution that avoids that I get into any sort of legal trouble (yes, thats selfish, but that is my p.o.v)<br />
[16:57:19] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder3_: if you don't want any trouble, let me close GLBSE<br />
[16:57:26] <strong>shareholder1</strong> shareholder3 we dont have any immunity<br />
[16:57:40] <strong>shareholder2</strong> so it's been 1 1/2 years<br />
[16:57:42] <strong>chrisrico</strong> you could sell your shares and exit yourself,t hough<br />
[16:57:45] <strong>shareholder2</strong> suddenly we have to close it<br />
[16:57:48] <strong>nefario</strong> immunity!?<br />
[16:57:53] <strong>chrisrico</strong> but not if Nefario goes through with his plan and requires identification<br />
[16:57:56] <strong>da2ce796</strong> shareholder1: do not suppose things.<br />
[16:58:00] <strong>nefario</strong> guys if GLBSE is closed<br />
[16:58:03] <strong>shareholder2</strong> oh, and request AML, of course<br />
[16:58:08] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> I find out now that apparently this is illegal. if it is illegal, I stop immedialtely and give my shares back<br />
[16:58:09] <strong>nefario</strong> then there won't be any problems<br />
[16:58:16] <strong>da2ce796</strong> ^^<br />
[16:58:30] <strong>nefario</strong> I don't have any choice on the AML<br />
[16:58:34] <strong>chrisrico</strong> *according to nefario, it's illegal<br />
[16:58:49] <strong>da2ce796</strong> it is better that we run with our tail between our legs, than all end up sharing a cell.<br />
[16:58:59] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> then I am for closing GLBSE guys. there is no way that a handful of people can stem all these government agqancies<br />
[16:59:18] <strong>shareholder2</strong> da2ce796: we don't even know if there is an investigation or order<br />
[16:59:19] <strong>theymos</strong> ColdHardMetal: Note that I am proxying for bitdragon.<br />
[16:59:25] <strong>shareholder2</strong> since he doesn't want to tell us anything<br />
[16:59:40] <strong>da2ce796</strong> shareholder2: put the peices together mate.<br />
[16:59:49] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> do you have a signed message to that effect theymos?<br />
[16:59:54] <strong>shareholder1</strong> we dont have all the information<br />
[16:59:56] <strong>shareholder2</strong> da2ce796: he could be abusing our trust<br />
[16:59:59] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder2: I can't tell you if there is an order if there IS one<br />
[17:00:09] <strong>theymos</strong> ColdHardMetal: He said it in that email discussion.<br />
[17:00:13] <strong>shareholder1</strong> ^^^<br />
[17:00:29] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> why dont we close it then. there is no gain trying to keep it: reputation is damaged, no legal way worldwide to keep it going, why not focusing on other bitcoin ventures that are legal<br />
[17:00:33] <strong>shareholder1</strong> I remember bitdragon saying it<br />
[17:00:52] <strong>shareholder2</strong> GLBSE reputation isn't damaged<br />
[17:00:55] <strong>shareholder2</strong> nefario reputation is<br />
[17:01:00] <strong>shareholder1</strong> yep<br />
[17:01:00] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> me to, but bylaws state that proxy has to be dine via signed message stating that.<br />
[17:01:11] <strong>nefario</strong> also guys<br />
[17:01:11] <strong>da2ce796</strong> I propose that we support nefario as much as we can; in shutting down GLBSE.<br />
[17:01:18] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> agree<br />
[17:01:27] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i have a suggestion<br />
[17:01:27] <strong>nefario</strong> we can continue trying to get this up legit as an entirely new entity<br />
[17:01:32] <strong>shareholder2</strong> that can mutually benefit us<br />
[17:01:36] <strong>nefario</strong> not connected to GLBSE<br />
[17:01:48] <strong>shareholder2</strong> da2ce796 and shareholder3_ can retreat and give us their shares, proportionally<br />
[17:01:52] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> I am all for making this legit<br />
[17:01:53] <strong>shareholder2</strong> if they want to get out<br />
[17:02:00] <strong>shareholder2</strong> at all costs i mean<br />
[17:02:03] <strong>theymos</strong> ColdHardMetal: Did he sign that message to you about me selling his shares? He mentioned proxying in that email too.<br />
[17:02:09] <strong>shareholder2</strong> the rest can move GLBSE forward<br />
[17:02:09] <strong>shareholder4</strong> nefario: after the PR shitstorm this is going to cause?<br />
[17:02:10] <strong>nefario</strong> shoot<br />
[17:02:38] <strong>da2ce796</strong> lol... not publisity like bad publiticy<br />
[17:02:44] <strong>shareholder2</strong> it should be easy enough to reallocate shares if somebody wants out because of legal fear<br />
[17:02:46] <strong>theymos</strong> shareholder3_: I will buy your shares for 5 BTC.<br />
[17:02:46] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> theymos: no he didn't<br />
[17:02:54] <strong>theymos</strong> ColdHardMetal: Oh, too bad.<br />
[17:02:59] <strong>shareholder2</strong> I bid 6 :P<br />
[17:03:00] <strong>nefario</strong> eh<br />
[17:03:05] <strong>nefario</strong> guys<br />
[17:03:14] <strong>shareholder1</strong> lol<br />
[17:03:16] <strong>nefario</strong> you giving your shares to these will seriously fuck me over<br />
[17:03:18] <strong>shareholder4</strong> sois actively trying to destroy our investment part of your legal strategy, or can we try and find an agreement?<br />
[17:03:21] <strong>shareholder2</strong> nefario: ?<br />
[17:03:28] <strong>shareholder2</strong> what shareholder4 says<br />
[17:03:34] <strong>nefario</strong> not destroying<br />
[17:03:38] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i think my proposal is pretty good<br />
[17:03:42] <strong>shareholder2</strong> the ones who want out get out<br />
[17:03:46] <strong>shareholder2</strong> the ones who want to move on move on<br />
[17:03:49] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder2: what do you mean "move forward" then?<br />
[17:04:05] <strong>shareholder2</strong> continue GLBSE with a newly appointed head<br />
[17:04:18] <strong>nefario</strong> for fuck sake<br />
[17:04:20] <strong>shareholder1</strong> I dont want nefario to go to jail either<br />
[17:04:27] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> yeah<br />
[17:04:28] <strong>shareholder2</strong> neither do i<br />
[17:04:29] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> me neither<br />
[17:04:30] <strong>da2ce796</strong> shareholder2: we need to close up shop completely, then after the dust has setteld start something 100% legal from the ground up.<br />
[17:04:45] <strong>shareholder2</strong> 100% legal? how many millions do you think is that going to cost?<br />
[17:04:45] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> agree<br />
[17:04:48] <strong>nefario</strong> da2ce7 totally<br />
[17:04:56] <strong>shareholder2</strong> that's a fairy tale<br />
[17:04:57] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> I think da2ce7 is right. GLBSE is dead, as much as it pains me to say it.<br />
[17:04:58] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder2: no idea<br />
[17:05:03] <strong>shareholder2</strong> all will flock to MPEX and it will win<br />
[17:05:10] <strong>shareholder1</strong> yep<br />
[17:05:13] <strong>da2ce796</strong> ha.<br />
[17:05:14] <strong>nefario</strong> AHAHAHAHAaaaaaaaaaa<br />
[17:05:17] <strong>shareholder2</strong> because its operator isn't "worried" enough<br />
[17:05:19] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> at least we should try this option. I am sure that thsi effort would get support and probably new funding in the BTC community and beyond<br />
[17:05:21] <strong>nefario</strong> fine<br />
[17:05:38] <strong>nefario</strong> Wait until they come knocking on his door<br />
[17:05:47] <strong>da2ce796</strong> we can spin it as 'we are closing'  and do the neatest, cleanest, best run shut-down ever.<br />
[17:05:52] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> midterm this will win against MPEX and others as they will get shut down soon too<br />
[17:05:56] <strong>nefario</strong> for money laundering and funding terrorism<br />
[17:06:02] <strong>da2ce796</strong> nothing breads confidence like a well-run shutdown.<br />
[17:06:05] <strong>nefario</strong> that will be fun<br />
[17:06:12] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> agree<br />
[17:06:13] <strong>shareholder1</strong> I already reported MPEX for child porn<br />
[17:06:21] <strong>nefario</strong> yeah well<br />
[17:06:25] <strong>nefario</strong> TERRORISM<br />
[17:06:33] <strong>nefario</strong> but seriously though<br />
[17:06:39] <strong>theymos</strong> It can't be clean if IDs are required. The community will riot.<br />
[17:06:39] <strong>shareholder2</strong> ok, so who is on my side, ie continue GLBSE?<br />
[17:06:43] <strong>theymos</strong> I am.<br />
[17:06:46] <strong>nefario</strong> I couldn't possibly care less about mpex right now<br />
[17:06:57] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> the community will riot.<br />
[17:06:59] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> no to continue. just wont work<br />
[17:07:00] <strong>da2ce796</strong> shareholder1: forget about mpex.<br />
[17:07:05] <strong>shareholder2</strong> the community is already rioting<br />
[17:07:20] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i don't want to know what will happen if nefario really does the AML shit<br />
[17:07:22] <strong>da2ce796</strong> shareholder2: let them... all they do is scream<br />
[17:07:26] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> only those are rioting who are scammers and already gangsters in my p.o.v<br />
[17:07:31] <strong>theymos</strong> Nefario: This is a breach of the ToS. You may be sued for this.<br />
[17:07:37] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder2: I'm doing it whether you want or not<br />
[17:07:39] <strong>da2ce796</strong> 1. we should get glbse back-up with a 'messgae to the community'<br />
[17:07:43] <strong>nefario</strong> I don't have any choice in the matter<br />
[17:07:48] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> only if he passes that info on to a third party.<br />
[17:07:52] <strong>nefario</strong> theymos: can't sue me for following the law<br />
[17:08:04] <strong>nefario</strong> also<br />
[17:08:15] <strong>nefario</strong> anyone heard from Goat lately?<br />
[17:08:21] <strong>nefario</strong> the guy has disapeared<br />
[17:08:27] <strong>shareholder2</strong> what was the goat shit about?<br />
[17:08:28] <strong>shareholder1</strong> hes around<br />
[17:08:33] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> focus.<br />
[17:08:42] <strong>da2ce796</strong> look at the picture everyone.<br />
[17:08:45] <strong>shareholder2</strong> why did you suddenly delist his stuff?<br />
[17:08:50] <strong>shareholder2</strong> and his stuff only<br />
[17:08:52] <strong>da2ce796</strong> connect the dots. :P<br />
[17:09:01] <strong>nefario</strong> thank you da2ce7<br />
[17:09:15] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> did he call the FSA or SEC?<br />
[17:09:19] <strong>nefario</strong> I can't say anymore about goat except he is a liability<br />
[17:09:24] <strong>nefario</strong> and now<br />
[17:09:31] <strong>nefario</strong> he is not OUR liability anymore<br />
[17:09:36] <strong>shareholder2</strong> the only picture i see is that he suddenly got "worried" and decided to close up everything, against the will of some of our shareholders<br />
[17:09:52] <strong>shareholder2</strong> the people who want to continue should be given the option to do so, while the rest can leave<br />
[17:09:53] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> if we're going to do this we need a better system than the codes you gave goat.<br />
[17:10:05] <strong>shareholder1</strong> ^^^^ that is my main issue<br />
[17:10:08] <strong>nefario</strong> no<br />
[17:10:12] <strong>nefario</strong> not like goat<br />
[17:10:25] <strong>shareholder2</strong> of course not<br />
[17:10:28] <strong>shareholder2</strong> this time it's with ID<br />
[17:10:28] <strong>da2ce796</strong> we need to pack-up this baby like pros.<br />
[17:10:36] <strong>nefario</strong> goat had to be taken off GLBSE ASAP, codes was the quickest thing I could come up with<br />
[17:10:40] <strong>theymos</strong> Shutting down GLBSE is in violation of the bylaws: "BitcoinGlobal, whose initial stated purpose is the development and maintenance of the Global Bitcoin Stock Exchange trading platform"<br />
[17:10:42] <strong>da2ce796</strong> the neatest shutdown of a bitcoin company ever.<br />
[17:10:45] <strong>shareholder1</strong> this is gonna ruin a lot of people because as an asset issuer I cant afford to shut down<br />
[17:10:57] <strong>shareholder2</strong> theymos: i think there is no question left he is violating our agreements<br />
[17:11:11] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder1: you can continue without GLBSE<br />
[17:11:11] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> agree to da2ce796<br />
[17:11:19] <strong>nefario</strong> I'm working on some basic management code<br />
[17:11:26] <strong>nefario</strong> for issuers<br />
[17:11:32] <strong>nefario</strong> it's going to be pretty basic<br />
[17:11:37] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> those who want to run an illegal stock exchange could do it separately if they want<br />
[17:11:41] <strong>nefario</strong> but make running their show possible<br />
[17:12:08] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> (1) shutting down GLBSE in a neat and clean way (2) register is and make it legal under a new framework<br />
[17:12:15] <strong>shareholder1</strong> You need to let people still run their own shit<br />
[17:12:24] <strong>nefario</strong> yeah<br />
[17:12:28] <strong>shareholder2</strong> stop kidding yourself<br />
[17:12:32] <strong>shareholder2</strong> (2) will never happen<br />
[17:12:41] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> MtGox also made it<br />
[17:12:45] <strong>shareholder2</strong> it's impossible, and if it is, it will require millions/billions<br />
[17:12:48] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder2: I think it's possible<br />
[17:12:58] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder2: not true<br />
[17:13:00] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> let nafario explain why its possible<br />
[17:13:01] <strong>nefario</strong> tens of thousands<br />
[17:13:03] <strong>nefario</strong> yes<br />
[17:13:06] <strong>theymos</strong> shareholder3_: Shutting down GLBSE guarantees that your shares will be worth 0, and doesn't increase your legal risk. What's done is done, legal or not.<br />
[17:13:08] <strong>nefario</strong> millions no<br />
[17:13:10] <strong>shareholder2</strong> ok, please do<br />
[17:13:10] <strong>da2ce796</strong> shareholder2: but we don't want option A(now) go to jail on terroism charges.<br />
[17:13:14] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> I dont know enough about it to get 100% confidence<br />
[17:13:14] <strong>shareholder1</strong> yes you can runa pink sheets market using registered brokers<br />
[17:13:28] <strong>theymos</strong> shareholder3_: Doesn't decrease your risk, I mean.<br />
[17:13:38] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i propose again<br />
[17:13:39] <strong>nefario</strong> I have no problem if we shut down to have the same share/stock ratio for any new legal entity<br />
[17:13:45] <strong>nefario</strong> as we currently have<br />
[17:13:49] <strong>nefario</strong> and<br />
[17:13:52] <strong>nefario</strong> we all become legit<br />
[17:14:02] <strong>shareholder1</strong> I have young kids and dont want to go to guantonomo bay in an orange jumpsuit lol<br />
[17:14:06] <strong>shareholder2</strong> nice fairy tale nefario<br />
[17:14:16] <strong>da2ce796</strong> shareholder2: theymos:  I'm behind nefario on this one... sorry.  I live to fight annother day.<br />
[17:14:19] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder1: if we're going legit you won'<br />
[17:14:20] <strong>nefario</strong> t<br />
[17:14:26] <strong>shareholder2</strong> da2ce796: i'll take your shares<br />
[17:14:34] <strong>theymos</strong> da2ce796: How does this decrease your risk?<br />
[17:14:37] <strong>chrisrico</strong> da2ce796: why can't you just leave us with GLBSE, rather than backing Nefario in his actions against the shareholders?<br />
[17:14:51] <strong>nefario</strong> because GLBSE is closing down<br />
[17:14:55] <strong>nefario</strong> like it or lump it<br />
[17:14:56] <strong>da2ce796</strong> chrisrico: becasue I trust the character of nefario<br />
[17:15:01] <strong>nefario</strong> and<br />
[17:15:10] <strong>nefario</strong> we can take it legit<br />
[17:15:14] <strong>nefario</strong> or give up on it entirely<br />
[17:15:17] <strong>shareholder2</strong> da2ce796: do you trust his business sense?<br />
[17:15:19] <strong>shareholder1</strong> how is nefario going to run a legit bitcoin business when he has a fucking scammer tag :P<br />
[17:15:24] <strong>nefario</strong> but we CANNOT continue as we currently are<br />
[17:15:26] <strong>chrisrico</strong> why would anyone ever trust you again, nefario?<br />
[17:15:32] <strong>da2ce796</strong> shareholder2: really not the point now.<br />
[17:15:42] <strong>shareholder2</strong> that it is possible to "go legit" with the income and expenses we have?<br />
[17:15:44] <strong>nefario</strong> chrisrico: why wouldn't they<br />
[17:15:50] <strong>nefario</strong> everyone is getting their bitcoin back<br />
[17:15:55] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> I think nefario can get back trust<br />
[17:15:56] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> brb<br />
[17:15:57] <strong>chrisrico</strong> including shareholders?<br />
[17:15:58] <strong>shareholder1</strong> no they arent<br />
[17:16:17] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> especially if it becomes clear that he was told that the current version of GLBSE was illegal<br />
[17:16:19] <strong>chrisrico</strong> and they will only get theri BTC back IF THEY GIVE YOU THEIR IDENTITY INFORMATION<br />
[17:16:27] <strong>shareholder2</strong> nefario violated our trust, violated goat's rights (however annoying he was) and abandoned GLBSE users<br />
[17:16:29] <strong>nefario</strong> chrisrico: what do you want me to do? If I had over GLBSE to someone else I still get fucked<br />
[17:16:36] <strong>nefario</strong> I can't just walk away<br />
[17:16:49] <strong>nefario</strong> I didn't sign up to run something that is breaking the law<br />
[17:16:50] <strong>chrisrico</strong> let me ask you a hypothetical question<br />
[17:16:54] <strong>chrisrico</strong> bullshit you didn't!<br />
[17:16:55] <strong>nefario</strong> GLBSE and bitcoin was in a grey area<br />
[17:17:00] <strong>shareholder1</strong> lol<br />
[17:17:07] <strong>nefario</strong> that area is nolonger grey<br />
[17:17:09] <strong>shareholder2</strong> from one day to the other<br />
[17:17:09] <strong>chrisrico</strong> you thought an unregulated securities market was a "gray area"?<br />
[17:17:10] <strong>shareholder2</strong> it is RED<br />
[17:17:11] <strong>da2ce796</strong> ok... well I'm for shutting down GLBSE neat and tidy.<br />
[17:17:16] <strong>shareholder1</strong> you only got legal advice now???<br />
[17:17:22] <strong>nefario</strong> yeah<br />
[17:17:28] <strong>nefario</strong> not free you know<br />
[17:17:28] <strong>da2ce796</strong> crossing all the legal dots and t's.<br />
[17:17:30] <strong>nefario</strong> and<br />
[17:17:31] <strong>chrisrico</strong> da2ce796: by neat and tidy, you mean requiring AML information from all asset holders and issuers?<br />
[17:17:34] <strong>shareholder2</strong> shareholder1: yes. he's been acting weirdly ever since talking to a lawyer<br />
[17:17:41] <strong>da2ce796</strong> chrisrico: yes.<br />
[17:17:42] <strong>nefario</strong> this isn't something an average lawyer knows anything about<br />
[17:17:57] <strong>chrisrico</strong> nefario: if you were removed as ceo, would you return the funds you control back to shareholders/<br />
[17:17:59] <strong>nefario</strong> chrisrico: yes<br />
[17:18:01] <strong>shareholder2</strong> chrisrico: sounds very neat and tidy indeed<br />
[17:18:24] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> ifnowadays you also have to provide ID docs to the exchanges<br />
[17:18:25] <strong>nefario</strong> chrisrico: if I was removed I would shut down GLBSE and return all funds to users, providing they give their AML info<br />
[17:18:33] <strong>shareholder2</strong> ColdHardMetal: did the motion pass?<br />
[17:18:33] <strong>nefario</strong> but I'll do that anyway<br />
[17:18:42] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder2: cold is gone for a minute<br />
[17:18:43] <strong>chrisrico</strong> so you would steal company funds, then?<br />
[17:18:44] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> so yes, not everyone likes it, but the ones that are no criminals WILL provide their ID<br />
[17:18:53] <strong>nefario</strong> chrisrico: how do I steal company funds?<br />
[17:19:03] <strong>chrisrico</strong> if you are removed as ceo, those would no longer be for you to control<br />
[17:19:10] <strong>nefario</strong> HAHAHA<br />
[17:19:11] <strong>shareholder1</strong> ^^^<br />
[17:19:15] <strong>nefario</strong> I'm still liable<br />
[17:19:18] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> back<br />
[17:19:25] <strong>nefario</strong> for that and EVERYTHING that has happened on GLBSE thus far<br />
[17:19:31] <strong>chrisrico</strong> and?<br />
[17:19:40] <strong>chrisrico</strong> that's not our fault<br />
[17:19:54] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> guys, this si all hypothetical. we have to understand that nefario is forced to act like that. I would argue everyone of us would behave exactly in the same way as him<br />
[17:19:58] <strong>shareholder2</strong> GLBSE is ruled by nefario's lawyer now<br />
[17:20:00] <strong>shareholder2</strong> not shareholders<br />
[17:20:06] <strong>shareholder2</strong> you have to understand<br />
[17:20:20] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> thats it ^^^<br />
[17:20:24] <strong>shareholder2</strong> shareholder3_: i don't know whether he is being forced<br />
[17:20:24] <strong>shareholder4</strong> lol, like a real company<br />
[17:20:29] <strong>shareholder2</strong> it doesn't sound like he is<br />
[17:20:41] <strong>shareholder2</strong> sounds more like he suddenly got cold feet thinking about it and wants to close up shop<br />
[17:20:50] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> shareholder2: it's at 45% of shares present, and I haven't voted yet.<br />
[17:20:55] <strong>shareholder1</strong> did the motion pass ?<br />
[17:21:01] <strong>shareholder2</strong> ColdHardMetal: ok, so you couldmake it pass<br />
[17:21:01] <strong>shareholder1</strong> ok<br />
[17:21:09] <strong>shareholder2</strong> interesting situation<br />
[17:21:16] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> for you maybe lol<br />
[17:21:31] <strong>nefario</strong> you know what is interesting<br />
[17:21:44] <strong>nefario</strong> my landlady is watching american pie 2 now as I'm here<br />
[17:21:47] <strong>nefario</strong> and I'm shaking<br />
[17:21:54] <strong>nefario</strong> she thinks I'm cold<br />
[17:22:25] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> i belive nafario is a good person<br />
[17:22:37] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> he has leaned forward and takne much more risk that all us of together<br />
[17:22:53] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> and we need to stop thinking only in a shareholder4ry way<br />
[17:23:07] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i'm thinking in a responsibility way<br />
[17:23:12] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> yes, I would have loved to make millions with this investment, but lets find another one<br />
[17:23:22] <strong>shareholder2</strong> fucking over GLBSE customers and clients is abandoning it<br />
[17:23:25] <strong>shareholder2</strong> and demanding AML<br />
[17:23:26] <strong>nefario</strong> closing down GLBSE, and ending it as an entity as it currently stands in a clean fashion, and then creating a legal entity removes pretty much all the risk for us<br />
[17:23:34] <strong>shareholder1</strong> requiring AML from people is a breach of trust<br />
[17:23:43] <strong>shareholder2</strong> tell me how you will make that legal entity<br />
[17:23:45] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder1: I don't have a choice<br />
[17:23:49] <strong>shareholder2</strong> any concrete plans?<br />
[17:23:58] <strong>nefario</strong> create a company, submit to the FSA<br />
[17:24:02] <strong>da2ce796</strong> shareholder1: that is the law, and the law dosn't care about 'trust'<br />
[17:24:06] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> shareholder2, I agree that this is not ideal for customers - in contrast, it pretty sad for them. BUT: they should have done their research themselves that this was a grey area if not more<br />
[17:24:10] <strong>shareholder2</strong> we talked about legitimizing GLBSE last meeting<br />
[17:24:11] <strong>nefario</strong> meeting lawyer on wed. for the details<br />
[17:24:18] <strong>shareholder1</strong> glbse is now a honeypot<br />
[17:24:22] <strong>shareholder2</strong> some shareholders have expressed they don't want to be part of it and wanted to sell<br />
[17:24:29] <strong>shareholder2</strong> you made it impossible for them<br />
[17:24:30] <strong>da2ce796</strong> shareholder1: glbse is shutdown.<br />
[17:24:32] <strong>shareholder2</strong> (i was one of them)<br />
[17:24:57] <strong>shareholder2</strong> those shareholders imo now have the right to take their shares and make the best out of it<br />
[17:25:19] <strong>shareholder4</strong> can you even register with the FSA after running GLBSE?<br />
[17:25:19] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder2: whether it was me or someone else, GLBSE would have been shutdown anyway if it was run in it's current fashion?<br />
[17:25:34] <strong>shareholder2</strong> nefario: GLBSE is nothing but a server and a domain<br />
[17:25:39] <strong>shareholder2</strong> and you<br />
[17:25:40] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> I have the feeling that it would be best for all shareholders to preserve the maximum value of their shares to follow nefarios proposal<br />
[17:25:41] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder4 sure I can<br />
[17:25:42] <strong>shareholder2</strong> all can be swapped<br />
[17:25:46] <strong>shareholder1</strong> how do we know this data wont be used against people in a subpoena ?<br />
[17:25:50] <strong>da2ce796</strong> shareholder2: you can say what you want. but I don't care about GLBSE's by-laws anyomre... so I'm with nefario in shutting this thing down.<br />
[17:26:05] <strong>shareholder2</strong> if you don't care about the bylaws, then forfeit your shares<br />
[17:26:27] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> shareholder2: GLBSE is more: it nefario who put all his swaet 24h per day in it. who of us can put som much time and energy behind it?<br />
[17:26:31] <strong>shareholder1</strong> shareholder2 the motion hasnt passed yet :P<br />
[17:26:32] <strong>shareholder2</strong> but i see we won't come to an agreement here anyway<br />
[17:26:52] <strong>shareholder2</strong> shareholder3_: to be honest, nefario has done more bad than good lately<br />
[17:26:58] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder1: if the law (I don't know what is required, a court order or whatever) comes and asks for those details, and they have all the paperwork they need then I will provide, and that will be made clear to EVERYONE who submits their AML info<br />
[17:26:59] <strong>theymos</strong> ColdHardMetal: Since nefario refuses to follow the bylaws, can we strip him of his shares?<br />
[17:27:06] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> actually, if shareholder3 votes no, as I beleive he's changed to, that puts the motion at 35% and my vote doesn't make it.<br />
[17:27:34] <strong>shareholder1</strong> theymos no<br />
[17:27:48] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> nothin in the bylaws allows for that.<br />
[17:27:51] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> imo.<br />
[17:28:00] <strong>shareholder2</strong> shareholder3_: theymos has already expressed he could take over most things in the short term<br />
[17:28:09] <strong>nefario</strong> theymos, you are a nasty piece of work<br />
[17:28:11] <strong>shareholder2</strong> we can find a suitable person then<br />
[17:28:29] <strong>nefario</strong> I won't be giving the server, domain, db or anything to anyone else<br />
[17:28:39] <strong>nefario</strong> I am shutting down GLBSE<br />
[17:28:42] <strong>shareholder2</strong> fine, but this is on you<br />
[17:28:54] <strong>nefario</strong> I have no problem selling the code<br />
[17:29:13] <strong>nefario</strong> but it is best for all of us to put GLBSE to a nice quiet rest<br />
[17:29:21] <strong>nefario</strong> and then start again the right way<br />
[17:29:34] <strong>shareholder1</strong> It kinda fucks me over because my asset relies on other assets to function<br />
[17:29:39] <strong>shareholder2</strong> theymos and I didn't want to start the "right way" and have expressed that much in the last meeting, nefario<br />
[17:29:49] <strong>shareholder2</strong> you kind of robbed us of our chances to get out of the way<br />
[17:29:55] <strong>nefario</strong> no I didn't<br />
[17:29:57] <strong>nefario</strong> the state dud<br />
[17:29:58] <strong>nefario</strong> did<br />
[17:30:04] <strong>shareholder1</strong> ^^^<br />
[17:30:20] <strong>shareholder2</strong> had we had 1 more week, there would only be 100% consent here with your actions (most likely)<br />
[17:30:36] <strong>nefario</strong> we didn't have one more week<br />
[17:30:42] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> that would have been pretty rough on the new owners.<br />
[17:30:45] <strong>shareholder2</strong> ok<br />
[17:30:48] <strong>da2ce796</strong> shareholder2: I'm glad that we droped goat instantly.<br />
[17:31:05] <strong>shareholder2</strong> instantly? he's been a pain for a year or so<br />
[17:31:05] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> ok.<br />
[17:31:07] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> not sure with me. frankly, i was pissed with nefarios communications and still am. but hearing the background now tells me there is no other option<br />
[17:31:27] <strong>nefario</strong> I made a big mistake with goat<br />
[17:31:27] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> there aren't enough votes to remove Nefario. even if there were he would proceed to shut down anyway.<br />
[17:31:30] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> and i want to support nefario as his vision is the right longterm sgtrategy to at least have a chance to make this BIG<br />
[17:31:34] <strong>nefario</strong> that was talking about it on the forums<br />
[17:31:40] <strong>nefario</strong> I shouldn't have said anything<br />
[17:32:08] <strong>shareholder2</strong> shareholder3_: as if he would give you a share in that<br />
[17:32:20] <strong>shareholder2</strong> he'll just start it anew without us<br />
[17:32:34] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder2: I will do it at the current shares we have now<br />
[17:32:42] <strong>shareholder2</strong> ok<br />
[17:32:47] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i can't do anything to stop you<br />
[17:32:49] <strong>shareholder1</strong> we are gonna ho,d you to that<br />
[17:32:54] <strong>shareholder2</strong> so i hope you do the right thing<br />
[17:33:29] <strong>nefario</strong> sure<br />
[17:33:37] <strong>shareholder2</strong> you obviously have more info than we do. i don't know for sure if you just went paranoid or if the FSA has come knocking<br />
[17:33:54] <strong>nefario</strong> read what I said<br />
[17:33:57] <strong>nefario</strong> my worries<br />
[17:34:03] <strong>nefario</strong> 1) AML<br />
[17:34:06] <strong>nefario</strong> 2) Tax<br />
[17:34:09] <strong>nefario</strong> 3) Regulations<br />
[17:34:11] <strong>nefario</strong> in that order<br />
[17:34:21] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> I think a clean shutdown is our only real option.<br />
[17:34:30] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> can we have a motion that nefario (if this thing continues as he proposes, provided we agree to that) needs to align all communication externally with some of us or delegates to someone who is better in communcations?<br />
[17:34:35] <strong>shareholder1</strong> Is the ID I submitted fpr my asset enough to pass AML ?<br />
[17:34:51] <strong>nefario</strong> I don't know<br />
[17:34:56] <strong>nefario</strong> I didn't do verification<br />
[17:34:59] <strong>nefario</strong> that was cold<br />
[17:35:02] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> how much more could they need?<br />
[17:35:02] <strong>nefario</strong> cold?<br />
[17:35:04] <strong>shareholder1</strong> Because I no longer have  adrivers license<br />
[17:35:15] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> what do they need, do you even know?<br />
[17:35:19] <strong>nefario</strong> lose it or have it revoked?<br />
[17:35:25] <strong>shareholder1</strong> Its suspended<br />
[17:35:30] <strong>nefario</strong> oh thats fine<br />
[17:35:31] <strong>nefario</strong> well<br />
[17:35:33] <strong>nefario</strong> for AML<br />
[17:35:35] <strong>nefario</strong> IMO<br />
[17:35:35] <strong>nefario</strong> so<br />
[17:36:07] <strong>nefario</strong> we need gov. issued photo ID, a pic of the user with their GLBSE ID, and proof of address<br />
[17:36:12] <strong>nefario</strong> gox style proof of address<br />
[17:36:13] <strong>nefario</strong> so<br />
[17:36:16] <strong>nefario</strong> utility bill<br />
[17:36:25] <strong>nefario</strong> maybe a tax reciept<br />
[17:36:32] <strong>da2ce796</strong> ok, lets pack this baby up.<br />
[17:36:32] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> guess I can't get my .3 BTC then :(<br />
[17:36:37] <strong>shareholder1</strong> I have none of those and cant get them<br />
[17:36:39] *** shareholder2 Quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)<br />
[17:36:55] *** shareholder2 joined the channel<br />
[17:36:56] *** shareholder2 Quit IRC (Changing host)<br />
[17:36:56] *** shareholder2 joined the channel<br />
[17:36:59] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder1: you have a welfare slip<br />
[17:37:12] <strong>nefario</strong> ?<br />
[17:37:14] <strong>shareholder1</strong> maybe<br />
[17:37:37] <strong>shareholder2</strong> nefario: so you are telling me you just went paranoid because you talked to a lawyer and decided to do that on a whim? :(<br />
[17:37:45] <strong>nefario</strong> no<br />
[17:37:47] <strong>shareholder2</strong> that would suck<br />
[17:37:52] <strong>shareholder2</strong> ok<br />
[17:38:01] <strong>nefario</strong> also<br />
[17:38:11] <strong>nefario</strong> just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not after you<br />
[17:38:13] <strong>shareholder4</strong> he's telling it;s something worse than FSA<br />
[17:38:22] <strong>nefario</strong> I didn't say that<br />
[17:38:23] <strong>nefario</strong> but<br />
[17:38:26] <strong>shareholder2</strong> what could be worse shareholder4?<br />
[17:38:28] <strong>nefario</strong> I'm not denying it either<br />
[17:38:37] <strong>shareholder4</strong> 1) AML<br />
[17:38:47] <strong>shareholder2</strong> the tax agency?<br />
[17:38:53] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> sector 7g is after him!<br />
[17:39:07] <strong>shareholder1</strong> It just seems like they are creating a list to come after people who use bitcoin<br />
[17:39:26] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> will you be passing this ID info on to anyone?<br />
[17:39:40] <strong>shareholder2</strong> good thing i had no BTC on GLBSE<br />
[17:39:49] <strong>nefario</strong> ColdHardMetal: only if requested, by the right authorities with the right paperwork<br />
[17:39:50] <strong>da2ce796</strong> ColdHardMetal: AML details are avalibe on request.<br />
[17:39:55] <strong>shareholder2</strong> nefario: will shareholders need to AML too?<br />
[17:40:01] <strong>nefario</strong> yes<br />
[17:40:11] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i mean for the money we have in cold<br />
[17:40:16] <strong>shareholder2</strong> the GLBSE's assets<br />
[17:40:21] <strong>nefario</strong> ????<br />
[17:40:21] <strong>shareholder2</strong> however little it is<br />
[17:40:32] <strong>nefario</strong> I don't get what you mean<br />
[17:40:36] <strong>nefario</strong> start from the begining<br />
[17:40:37] <strong>shareholder2</strong> GLBSE has assets i presume. BTC that it owns<br />
[17:40:45] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> shareholder2: you mean our leftover operatin gfunds, whatever that turns out to be.<br />
[17:40:49] <strong>shareholder2</strong> so bitcoinglobal will own some BTC that it needs to distribute to shareholders<br />
[17:40:50] <strong>nefario</strong> yeah<br />
[17:40:51] <strong>shareholder2</strong> right<br />
[17:40:56] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> nefario, how will you make sure that the asset owners and issuers will be handled well and better than goat?<br />
[17:40:59] <strong>shareholder2</strong> better not be AML too -_-<br />
[17:41:10] <strong>nefario</strong> going to have to be<br />
[17:41:12] <strong>nefario</strong> everything is<br />
[17:41:20] <strong>shareholder2</strong> good thing theymos has the treasury then<br />
[17:41:35] <strong>nefario</strong> I don't think it's a good thing<br />
[17:41:38] <strong>shareholder2</strong> AML my butt<br />
[17:42:09] <strong>shareholder1</strong> this is why I dont use mt gox<br />
[17:42:10] <strong>nefario</strong> the idea that I've given 15K USD worth of something to an anonymous person "to hold" looks really fucking bad for me<br />
[17:42:21] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i'm glad you did<br />
[17:42:36] <strong>shareholder2</strong> at least now there is the chance i won't have to get naked<br />
[17:42:38] <strong>nefario</strong> you and theymos are so eager to see me fucked? Why>?<br />
[17:42:44] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> come on guys, lets not slit up , lets act like a team<br />
[17:42:50] <strong>shareholder2</strong> because you aren't letting us in<br />
[17:43:08] <strong>nefario</strong> I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT<br />
[17:43:08] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i don't want to see you fucked<br />
[17:43:14] <strong>shareholder4</strong> shareholder3_: not that Nefario is acting like we're a team....<br />
[17:43:27] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder4: not like I've got much of a choice<br />
[17:43:32] <strong>nefario</strong> well<br />
[17:43:33] <strong>da2ce796</strong> lets just trust nefario and gets going.<br />
[17:43:33] <strong>nefario</strong> no<br />
[17:43:36] <strong>nefario</strong> thats not true<br />
[17:43:43] <strong>nefario</strong> I was given two choices<br />
[17:43:55] <strong>shareholder1</strong> with or without lube ?<br />
[17:44:02] <strong>nefario</strong> one good, one bad<br />
[17:44:16] <strong>nefario</strong> what shareholder1 said<br />
[17:44:20] <strong>chrisrico</strong> can you tell us who gave you these choices?<br />
[17:44:35] <strong>da2ce796</strong> chrisrico:  of course he cannot.<br />
[17:44:38] <strong>shareholder1</strong> I dont want them to seize my house under the crime commission :P<br />
[17:45:14] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder1: there will be no seizing of houses<br />
[17:45:23] <strong>shareholder1</strong> Not that i really own it lol<br />
[17:45:23] <strong>nefario</strong> if you want<br />
[17:45:28] <strong>nefario</strong> what we can do<br />
[17:45:38] <strong>nefario</strong> is delay your ownership of the new company<br />
[17:45:46] <strong>nefario</strong> until after it's set up and running<br />
[17:45:50] <strong>nefario</strong> and you're confident<br />
[17:46:09] <strong>nefario</strong> that it's ok to legit on it<br />
[17:46:21] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> are u talking to all of us , nefario?<br />
[17:46:31] <strong>nefario</strong> it's up to you guys<br />
[17:46:33] <strong>shareholder1</strong> That would be better.<br />
[17:46:40] <strong>nefario</strong> if you want to be a shareholder from the start of the company<br />
[17:46:42] <strong>nefario</strong> then thats cool<br />
[17:46:47] <strong>nefario</strong> if you want to wait until later<br />
[17:46:56] <strong>nefario</strong> then we'll keep that option open<br />
[17:47:12] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> i am fine as long as i get constant evidence from you that you comply with all givermnemt and regulatory requirements<br />
[17:47:15] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> how do you plan to finance this new company?<br />
[17:47:23] <strong>shareholder1</strong> ^^^^<br />
[17:47:28] <strong>nefario</strong> good question<br />
[17:47:37] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> can't go to the public.<br />
[17:47:53] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> crowdfunding?<br />
[17:47:58] <strong>nefario</strong> meeting with lawyer on wed to cover these details<br />
[17:48:07] <strong>da2ce796</strong> k<br />
[17:48:25] <strong>nefario</strong> I also don't know how much it's going to cost<br />
[17:48:31] <strong>shareholder1</strong> a lot<br />
[17:48:36] <strong>nefario</strong> probably<br />
[17:48:37] <strong>nefario</strong> but<br />
[17:48:43] <strong>nefario</strong> probably less than we imagined<br />
[17:49:02] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> alright. so gg GLBSE. Next step to wind this up???<br />
[17:49:07] <strong>da2ce796</strong> Lets neatly pack up GLBSE.<br />
[17:49:24] <strong>nefario</strong> I put forward the motion that we bring GLBSE and bitcoin global to an end<br />
[17:49:27] <strong>shareholder4</strong> nefario: for the records, you arent going to hand over GLBSE even if a majority of shareholders is against shutting down right?<br />
[17:49:27] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> i truly think that if we reveal the plans to make it legit, this will turn around support in the community (at least the bright side of it) and new investments would flow if needed<br />
[17:49:48] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder3_: good idea<br />
[17:49:50] <strong>nefario</strong> another good idea<br />
[17:49:51] <strong>nefario</strong> we need<br />
[17:49:55] <strong>nefario</strong> a real PR person<br />
[17:49:58] <strong>nefario</strong> who is not me<br />
[17:50:01] <strong>nefario</strong> with another account<br />
[17:50:02] <strong>shareholder1</strong> yes<br />
[17:50:15] <strong>shareholder4</strong> i hear MPOE-PR is good<br />
[17:50:20] <strong>shareholder1</strong> bahaha<br />
[17:50:21] <strong>da2ce796</strong> lol<br />
[17:50:22] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> the finest<br />
[17:50:50] <strong>shareholder2</strong> MPOE-PR will be very happy to communicate that GLBSE is winding down<br />
[17:50:55] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i'm sure<br />
[17:51:04] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> It's not just PR nef. It's making rash decisions without prior thought that are the root of the problem.<br />
[17:51:09] <strong>chrisrico</strong> so I've been away for a bit, what did I miss?<br />
[17:51:10] <strong>shareholder1</strong> yes they will but we can say they are illegal<br />
[17:51:14] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> i know a few people in the community that could help on PR. i could ask once we have asolid plan to come back<br />
[17:51:36] <strong>shareholder2</strong> if GLBSE is to restart with nefario as face it's probably doomed<br />
[17:51:38] <strong>nefario</strong> ColdHardMetal: I didn't get to talk to you about what the lawyer recommended on Goat<br />
[17:51:41] <strong>chrisrico</strong> it's nefario, shareholder3_, da2ce796 and who else that want to shut down GLBSE?<br />
[17:52:01] <strong>shareholder1</strong> I dont want to but we have no choice<br />
[17:52:21] <strong>shareholder4</strong> nefario: for the records, you arent going to hand over GLBSE even if a majority of shareholders is against shutting down right?<br />
[17:52:23] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> I think I have to side with shut down. I just don;t see any other way out.<br />
[17:52:23] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> nefario, ColdhardMetal has a point. decisions need to be aligned first before moving forward (unless its sth against the law which seems to have triggered some of  your rushed decisions lately)<br />
[17:52:23] <strong>shareholder1</strong> I dont want to use a seat belt either but I have no choice<br />
[17:52:30] <strong>chrisrico</strong> shareholder1: you mean because nefario is going to move forward with or without us?<br />
[17:52:47] <strong>shareholder1</strong> chrisrico no because they state will<br />
[17:53:11] <strong>shareholder2</strong> shareholder3_: that's my problem with it, it only "seems"<br />
[17:53:18] <strong>chrisrico</strong> shareholder1: we've seen no evidence of that<br />
[17:53:20] <strong>shareholder2</strong> we've seen lots of such rash decisions in the past<br />
[17:53:35] <strong>shareholder2</strong> most of the time they were undone quickly<br />
[17:54:07] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> nefario, what is your response to "decisions need to be aligned first before moving forward" in the future<br />
[17:54:29] <strong>shareholder1</strong> I sick of the fucking scams on glbse and if this makes it better Im all for it<br />
[17:54:41] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> ^^^<br />
[17:54:44] <strong>chrisrico</strong> how is shutting GLBSE down going to solve that problem?<br />
[17:55:03] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> all people will have to register with IDs and everything first<br />
[17:55:04] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i'm sick of theft, we need to do away with property :D<br />
[17:55:11] <strong>shareholder1</strong> haha<br />
[17:55:17] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder3_: we're going to have a real company with a board<br />
[17:55:25] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> there is at least a much lower likelihood for scmas, apart from some new madoff kids<br />
[17:55:27] <strong>nefario</strong> so that should help I guess<br />
[17:55:38] <strong>shareholder2</strong> you don't stand a chance against mpex<br />
[17:55:41] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> makes sense<br />
[17:55:44] <strong>shareholder2</strong> with its low overhead<br />
[17:56:01] <strong>da2ce796</strong> shareholder2 we will be competing in a completely differnt market to mpex<br />
[17:56:04] <strong>shareholder2</strong> IF it is even possible to do legally<br />
[17:56:07] <strong>shareholder4</strong> shareholder2: actually it'a dofferent target<br />
[17:56:19] <strong>shareholder4</strong> if it's not wishful thinking<br />
[17:56:20] <strong>da2ce796</strong> as in, mpex will stop being our compittion.<br />
[17:56:26] <strong>shareholder1</strong> mpex will be classified as money launderers and terrorists<br />
[17:56:26] <strong>shareholder2</strong> really? satoshidice and bitvps look pretty legit to me<br />
[17:56:30] <strong>shareholder2</strong> bitvps even hosts GLBSE<br />
[17:56:31] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> this is irrlevant at this point.<br />
[17:56:39] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> agree with da2ce7, its a different, larger market the new GLBSE would operate in<br />
[17:56:41] <strong>shareholder2</strong> hosted, sorry<br />
[17:56:51] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> what needs to happen next:<br />
[17:56:57] <strong>chrisrico</strong> so your competition with be the NYSE<br />
[17:57:02] <strong>shareholder1</strong> yep<br />
[17:57:04] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> this is the big opportunity to create a new, efficient way to fund investments and strat ups<br />
[17:57:07] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> Nefario needs to make a post explaining this to the community,<br />
[17:57:09] <strong>chrisrico</strong> why would anyone use a dinky little bitcoin exchange, and how would it stay solvent?<br />
[17:57:21] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> and then he needs to start collecting IDs.<br />
[17:57:22] <strong>chrisrico</strong> when in order to list or invest on it you'd have to follow the same regulations as the billion dollar exchanges?<br />
[17:57:26] <strong>shareholder2</strong> chrisrico: haha, pretty much<br />
[17:57:39] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder2: bitvps hosts GLBSE images<br />
[17:57:41] <strong>chrisrico</strong> you're fucking delusional if you think it will work<br />
[17:57:46] <strong>nefario</strong> and a few other files<br />
[17:57:57] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> not much else the rest of us can do imo.<br />
[17:58:00] <strong>nefario</strong> chrisrico: the solution<br />
[17:58:02] <strong>shareholder2</strong> it's more likely that the NYSE lets companies trade in bitcoin than a legit PROFITABLE bitcoin stock market<br />
[17:58:03] <strong>nefario</strong> we don't just do bitcoin<br />
[17:58:08] <strong>nefario</strong> we ALSO do bitcoin<br />
[17:58:17] <strong>chrisrico</strong> lol<br />
[17:58:36] <strong>shareholder1</strong> yeah if you have aml you can do fiat<br />
[17:58:48] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i don't know how you guys can delude yourself into thinking it could ever work<br />
[17:58:55] <strong>nefario</strong> we can try<br />
[17:58:56] <strong>shareholder2</strong> but it doesn't matter anyway<br />
[17:59:03] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> i think there are tow clear next steps (1) shut down glbse in its current form, there is even not another meaningful choice (2) create a new business plan for the new venture<br />
[17:59:12] <strong>chrisrico</strong> so why don't you go off and try ON YOUR OWN, nefario, rather than taking our money hostage?<br />
[17:59:28] <strong>nefario</strong> chrisrico: I'm not taking any money hostage<br />
[17:59:34] <strong>nefario</strong> I've said I'll return all BTC<br />
[17:59:43] <strong>nefario</strong> and provide as much support as possible for issuers<br />
[17:59:43] <strong>shareholder1</strong> you sorta are :P<br />
[17:59:44] <strong>shareholder2</strong> AML sounds like hostage to me<br />
[17:59:44] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> I agree with chris and others that its not a no brainer, but BTC provides great advantages to help smaller companies with funding, much better than a real IPO on the MYSE<br />
[17:59:46] <strong>chrisrico</strong> ok, then I'll give you a address to which you can immediately return my invested bitcoin<br />
[17:59:48] <strong>da2ce796</strong> chrisrico: what moneys, are you talking about he peoples money who used to use glbse?<br />
[17:59:59] <strong>shareholder2</strong> shareholder3_: yes, they'll be doing that on mpex<br />
[18:00:09] <strong>shareholder2</strong> NYSE sucks because it's legal<br />
[18:00:16] <strong>shareholder2</strong> and has massive overhead<br />
[18:00:23] <strong>shareholder1</strong> I own shares in litecoinglobal so meh lol<br />
[18:00:36] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i actually thought about that<br />
[18:00:38] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> real companies won;t use MPEX anymore than they woul duse us in our current form.<br />
[18:00:39] <strong>shareholder1</strong> I hope they open a bitcoin version<br />
[18:00:46] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i thought maybe nefario bought into mpex somehow<br />
[18:00:50] <strong>nefario</strong> no<br />
[18:00:57] <strong>shareholder2</strong> becaus ethat's the only thing explaining that madness, lol<br />
[18:01:03] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> me neither MPEX is doomed big time soon<br />
[18:01:04] <strong>nefario</strong> I can't even talk to the guy, not for lack of trying<br />
[18:01:06] <strong>shareholder1</strong> mpex cant accept usd :P<br />
[18:01:11] <strong>chrisrico</strong> da2ce796: I was referring to the shareholder money, but also that of the users<br />
[18:01:24] <strong>nefario</strong> I thought it was funny as soon as he saw that GLBSE was down, mpex price was up to 30BTC<br />
[18:01:26] <strong>shareholder2</strong> chrisrico: don't worry about shareholder money<br />
[18:01:30] <strong>shareholder2</strong> theymos is treasurer<br />
[18:01:41] <strong>chrisrico</strong> my understanding is that theymos holds the users' money<br />
[18:01:42] <strong>shareholder2</strong> and there's a chance he will not give a fk about AML<br />
[18:02:02] <strong>theymos</strong> I will not require AML. I don't have most user deposits, though.<br />
[18:02:05] <strong>nefario</strong> then he needs to return that users money<br />
[18:02:18] <strong>nefario</strong> theymos also doesn't have any users account info<br />
[18:02:21] <strong>theymos</strong> Send me the user database and I will happily return the money.<br />
[18:02:24] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i understand him being reluctant<br />
[18:02:27] <strong>nefario</strong> not a chance<br />
[18:02:28] <strong>shareholder2</strong> with so little info<br />
[18:02:36] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i would probably do the same<br />
[18:02:43] <strong>chrisrico</strong> nefario: what is the disaster plan for government intervention you mentioned here? "Yes we've got frequent offsite backups, you've need to read our threads on our disaster plans, from government action to me being hit by a bus."<br />
[18:02:52] <strong>chrisrico</strong> was it "shut down GLBSE and require IDs to withdraw your money"?<br />
[18:02:56] <strong>shareholder2</strong> chrisrico: that was all talk<br />
[18:03:04] <strong>nefario</strong> not really<br />
[18:03:04] <strong>shareholder2</strong> once the lawyer got to him, he got scared<br />
[18:03:09] <strong>shareholder1</strong> was bullshit<br />
[18:03:12] <strong>nefario</strong> if I'd been hit by a bus it would have worked<br />
[18:03:28] <strong>nefario</strong> government is more of a force majour than a bus though<br />
[18:03:57] <strong>chrisrico</strong> not really... it's just more drawn out, and they gave you an offer you couldn't refuse<br />
[18:04:04] <strong>chrisrico</strong> buses don't give you that offer<br />
[18:04:05] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> ok. can we try to make some decisions?<br />
[18:04:17] <strong>shareholder2</strong> we don't get to make decisions shareholder3_<br />
[18:04:20] <strong>shareholder1</strong> it would probably be less problematic to work with the mafia<br />
[18:04:21] <strong>shareholder2</strong> his lawyer does<br />
[18:04:30] <strong>shareholder4</strong> this<br />
[18:04:32] <strong>shareholder2</strong> as i said, GLBSE is now ruled by his lawyer<br />
[18:04:35] <strong>shareholder2</strong> not shareholders<br />
[18:04:39] <strong>chrisrico</strong> shareholder1: they are the mafia, just the biggest one in the area<br />
[18:05:04] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder2: we COULD go against what my lawyer says<br />
[18:05:07] <strong>nefario</strong> the result would be<br />
[18:05:10] <strong>shareholder4</strong> suppose, just for a moment, that we vite no<br />
[18:05:11] <strong>nefario</strong> GLBSE gets shut down<br />
[18:05:16] <strong>nefario</strong> and I get imprisoned<br />
[18:05:17] <strong>shareholder4</strong> what happens next?<br />
[18:05:28] <strong>shareholder2</strong> why imprisonment for you?<br />
[18:05:31] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> well, whatever, we can still try to act like shareholders, trying to decided what is the best plan weighing all the risk and opps, and the risk is 100% that the current plan does not work anymore. hence, I dont see why someone would oppose shutting GLBSE down inan orderly manner now<br />
[18:05:34] <strong>shareholder1</strong> because bitcoin<br />
[18:05:40] <strong>shareholder2</strong> if you don't have anything to do with it from that point<br />
[18:05:59] <strong>shareholder1</strong> glbse is gonna get shut down either way<br />
[18:06:18] <strong>chrisrico</strong> shareholder3_: "orderly manner" is not suddenly holding shareholder, issuer, and investor funds ransom based on nefario kowtowing to HIS government's demand for AML information<br />
[18:06:36] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i'll bet with you that mpex won't get shut down until the 2nd block reward halving in 2016/2017<br />
[18:06:50] <strong>shareholder2</strong> they might change server and domain<br />
[18:06:54] <strong>shareholder2</strong> but they'll do fine<br />
[18:07:05] <strong>nefario</strong> until he gets arrested<br />
[18:07:08] <strong>shareholder1</strong> wish you cvould exchnage your glbse shares for mpex lol<br />
[18:07:08] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> but they will then just be the heaven of scammers and remain small<br />
[18:07:22] <strong>shareholder2</strong> shareholder3_: bitvps and satoshidice doesn't look like heaven of scammers to me<br />
[18:07:36] <strong>shareholder1</strong> mpex doesnt have scammers from what i can see<br />
[18:07:43] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> once the news about what we are talking about gets out, MPEX will be under huge pressure, if they want or not<br />
[18:07:52] <strong>shareholder2</strong> shareholder3_: why?<br />
[18:08:03] <strong>shareholder1</strong> satoshidice is now on an illegal exchange :P<br />
[18:08:04] <strong>chrisrico</strong> because governments are magic, moral, law enforcing fairies<br />
[18:08:08] <strong>shareholder2</strong> everyone knew that bitcoin denominated stock markets aren't perfectly legal!<br />
[18:08:13] <strong>shareholder2</strong> everyone was ok with it<br />
[18:08:18] <strong>shareholder2</strong> suddenly nefario is no longer ok with it<br />
[18:08:22] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> because suddenly at least a significant portion of issues and traders will get "cold feet" and stop using it<br />
[18:08:45] <strong>chrisrico</strong> that's pure speculation, but not everyone is as concerned with following bullshit laws as some<br />
[18:08:46] <strong>shareholder4</strong> shareholder3_: I wouldn't bet on that<br />
[18:08:54] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i doubt it shareholder3_<br />
[18:08:55] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder2: you need to re-read what has been said here.<br />
[18:09:10] <strong>nefario</strong> chrisrico: not everyone here is anonymous<br />
[18:09:15] <strong>shareholder1</strong> shareholder2 if he has an order hes not allowed to talk about it<br />
[18:09:31] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> right, there will be some initial flow of users from glbse to mpex, but that will be temporary<br />
[18:09:33] <strong>shareholder1</strong> Its the same with the Australian crime commission<br />
[18:09:33] <strong>shareholder2</strong> shareholder1: i hope he does<br />
[18:09:38] <strong>shareholder2</strong> otherwise he would have betrayed us<br />
[18:09:43] <strong>chrisrico</strong> nefario: did you choose to become non-anonymous? or did we or the rest of the community force you?<br />
[18:09:59] <strong>chrisrico</strong> maybe you could own up to your own fucking decisions?<br />
[18:10:00] <strong>shareholder2</strong> actually, he probably betrayed us regardless \85<br />
[18:10:04] <strong>shareholder1</strong> they can drag you off the street and question you in secret and you cant tell anyone<br />
[18:10:16] <strong>nefario</strong> me giving up my identity to the community was the cost to make GLBSE the success it has become<br />
[18:10:41] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> which ^^^i think derserves some credit<br />
[18:10:46] <strong>shareholder1</strong> I still think you ened a platfrom for small companies to raise bitcoins on<br />
[18:10:47] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> nefario is holding his ass in the air for us<br />
[18:10:51] <strong>chrisrico</strong> which he has then destroyed over the course of two weeks<br />
[18:11:11] <strong>chrisrico</strong> he did so of his own volition, now he wants to fuck us over so that he is protected<br />
[18:11:18] <strong>shareholder2</strong> GLBSE success? lol<br />
[18:11:22] <strong>nefario</strong> ja<br />
[18:11:24] <strong>shareholder2</strong> success for mpex, maybe<br />
[18:11:24] <strong>nefario</strong> otherwise<br />
[18:11:30] <strong>nefario</strong> why are you here for<br />
[18:11:37] <strong>shareholder1</strong> the ony thing associated with gl;bse is scamming<br />
[18:11:39] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> law interpretation has (temporarily) destroyed it, not nefario<br />
[18:11:39] <strong>nefario</strong> if GLBSE wasn't a success then you wouldn't even bother<br />
[18:11:55] <strong>chrisrico</strong> GLBSE is such a success, we need to shut it down immediately!<br />
[18:12:02] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i mean it's no longer a success now that you fucked it up<br />
[18:12:09] <strong>nefario</strong> if GLBSE wasn't a success then no one would even notice we've dissapeared<br />
[18:12:14] <strong>shareholder1</strong> the state fucked it up<br />
[18:12:18] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> ^^^<br />
[18:12:27] <strong>chrisrico</strong> it doesn't stand to reason that the only reason it was a success is because you attached your real identity to it<br />
[18:12:35] <strong>nefario</strong> no it doesn't<br />
[18:12:39] <strong>nefario</strong> I also worked my ass off<br />
[18:12:41] <strong>chrisrico</strong> Bitcoin is a pretty big success right now and Satoshi never revealed his identity<br />
[18:12:43] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> guys, we wont solve this. lets get back to focus<br />
[18:12:52] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> accusations wont help now<br />
[18:13:00] <strong>chrisrico</strong> nefario: I don't deny that. however, you did so with the help of OUR funding<br />
[18:13:07] <strong>chrisrico</strong> it's not like you did it for free<br />
[18:13:16] <strong>nefario</strong> AND MY FUNDING<br />
[18:13:25] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> you are both right somewhat, but lets look forward now<br />
[18:13:34] <strong>chrisrico</strong> but at least 75% OUR funding<br />
[18:13:41] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> 83% actually<br />
[18:13:43] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> and mine.. we could go on like kids in the kinderdarden the whole time..<br />
[18:13:58] <strong>nefario</strong> yeah this isn't going anywhere in this train of thought<br />
[18:14:03] <strong>shareholder4</strong> and my funding is bigger than yours.....<br />
[18:14:04] <strong>chrisrico</strong> there is no forward, shareholder3... nefario is unilaterally shutting down GLBSE<br />
[18:14:09] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> debating about their gummibears who got most<br />
[18:14:18] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> chris, I know<br />
[18:14:25] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> no it isn't. I've wasted enough time on this over the last year. can we please resolve something so I can just move on.<br />
[18:14:33] <strong>nefario</strong> chrisrico: I DON:T HAVE A FUCKING CHOICE DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND<br />
[18:14:34] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> but the simple point is it sthe only viable option<br />
[18:15:09] <strong>shareholder1</strong> the simple point is some people are gonna lose bitcoins because they cant AML<br />
[18:15:15] <strong>shareholder1</strong> and thats pretty fucked up<br />
[18:15:39] <strong>shareholder4</strong> by the way, who's gonna gete those unclaimed bitcoins?<br />
[18:15:46] <strong>chrisrico</strong> what happens to the bitcoins of the individuals that don't agree to offer their identities?<br />
[18:15:46] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> I have more time invested in this than anyone except Nef. It's done whether he has our consent or not.<br />
[18:15:47] <strong>shareholder1</strong> ^^^^<br />
[18:15:55] <strong>nefario</strong> they don't get it<br />
[18:16:01] <strong>chrisrico</strong> what happens to it?<br />
[18:16:05] <strong>shareholder1</strong> but who gets it ?<br />
[18:16:05] <strong>nefario</strong> I don't know<br />
[18:16:06] <strong>chrisrico</strong> you keep it?<br />
[18:16:09] <strong>nefario</strong> HAHA<br />
[18:16:10] <strong>nefario</strong> me<br />
[18:16:11] <strong>nefario</strong> lol<br />
[18:16:11] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> we stick it in a public address and it sits there forever.<br />
[18:16:21] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> donate it to hungry kids in africa<br />
[18:16:23] <strong>chrisrico</strong> that includes shareholder funds?<br />
[18:16:26] <strong>da2ce796</strong> ColdHardMetal: yep<br />
[18:16:34] <strong>nefario</strong> I'll ask the lawyer what we do with the funds that are not claimed<br />
[18:16:42] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> is good for them and creates some good PR<br />
[18:16:43] <strong>shareholder1</strong> it has to sit in a public address forever<br />
[18:17:00] <strong>shareholder1</strong> no forced donation<br />
[18:17:04] <strong>shareholder1</strong> thats unethical<br />
[18:17:05] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> ok<br />
[18:17:06] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder1: I'll put it where the lawyer tells me to<br />
[18:17:13] <strong>nefario</strong> oh wow<br />
[18:17:21] <strong>shareholder1</strong> probably he will suggest that he gets it<br />
[18:17:31] <strong>nefario</strong> not likely<br />
[18:17:36] <strong>shareholder1</strong> are you paying the lawyer from company funds ?<br />
[18:17:37] <strong>nefario</strong> in which case<br />
[18:17:43] <strong>nefario</strong> ja<br />
[18:17:53] <strong>nefario</strong> it's a business cost<br />
[18:17:57] <strong>chrisrico</strong> what bullshit<br />
[18:18:05] <strong>nefario</strong> really?<br />
[18:18:10] <strong>chrisrico</strong> you're acting as if this was YOUR business<br />
[18:18:12] <strong>shareholder1</strong> I hope we get a tax deduction lol<br />
[18:18:32] <strong>shareholder4</strong> well that solves the problem: there will be no coins left<br />
[18:18:49] <strong>shareholder1</strong> shitstorm incoming<br />
[18:18:50] <strong>nefario</strong> chrisrico: I'm responsible for GLBSE, if you wan't to come along and put your name down and say you ran everything then go ahead<br />
[18:19:05] <strong>chrisrico</strong> that's not the only option<br />
[18:19:15] <strong>chrisrico</strong> you could choose to turn over all passwords and funds, and remove yourself from the operation<br />
[18:19:16] <strong>nefario</strong> whats the other option?<br />
[18:19:18] <strong>chrisrico</strong> instead you're choosing to hijack it<br />
[18:19:22] <strong>nefario</strong> no<br />
[18:19:31] <strong>shareholder1</strong> Did you use custpomer funds to hire the lawyer ?<br />
[18:19:33] <strong>nefario</strong> I'd be held responsible for everything up to now<br />
[18:19:38] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder1: no<br />
[18:19:42] <strong>chrisrico</strong> that's a non-sequitur<br />
[18:19:49] <strong>shareholder2</strong> nefario: WTF?<br />
[18:19:55] <strong>shareholder2</strong> was that the huge cost?k<br />
[18:19:57] <strong>chrisrico</strong> you're screwing us to cover your own ass, at least own up to it<br />
[18:20:01] <strong>shareholder2</strong> the development expenses?!<br />
[18:20:02] <strong>shareholder4</strong> nefario: you'll get immunity if you shut it down now?<br />
[18:20:14] <strong>shareholder1</strong> shareholder4 and so will we<br />
[18:20:19] <strong>shareholder2</strong> OUR money was used for a shitty lawyer who told you to close down GLBSE and devalue our shares to 0?!<br />
[18:20:23] <strong>shareholder2</strong> well fuck me<br />
[18:20:29] <strong>shareholder1</strong> shareholder4 yes<br />
[18:20:41] <strong>nefario</strong> shut down and start up with a clean slate<br />
[18:20:52] <strong>chrisrico</strong> then send me back my 250 BTC right now<br />
[18:21:18] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> noone likes losing money or not winning as much as he thought, but nefario is doing the right thing<br />
[18:21:22] <strong>shareholder4</strong> so do we get a choice on shutting down?<br />
[18:21:26] <strong>shareholder1</strong> no<br />
[18:21:30] <strong>da2ce796</strong> chrisrico: when you invest a in a company, you expect that moeny to be spent.<br />
[18:21:39] <strong>shareholder4</strong> do we get a choice on how it is shut down?<br />
[18:21:51] <strong>shareholder2</strong> GLBSE under illegal operation had a monthly deficit of over 600 or 800BTC because it paid for a lawyer<br />
[18:21:56] <strong>chrisrico</strong> da2ce796: not for the purpose of dissolving the company and holding funds hostage<br />
[18:21:57] <strong>shareholder2</strong> how do you imagine it will work out legally<br />
[18:22:01] <strong>shareholder2</strong> aaaaahahaha<br />

[18:22:41] <strong>da2ce796</strong> chrisrico: well I think that you can just suck eggs, because you beiing angry isnt going to change anything, or help anything.<br />
[18:22:44] <strong>nefario</strong> you're acting like teens<br />
[18:22:51] <strong>nefario</strong> we're dealing with the real world<br />
[18:22:53] <strong>nefario</strong> for what we're doing<br />
[18:22:58] <strong>shareholder1</strong> it is pretty hilarious<br />
[18:22:58] <strong>shareholder2</strong> you suddenly discovered that<br />
[18:22:58] <strong>nefario</strong> it NEEDS lawyers<br />
[18:23:00] <strong>shareholder2</strong> and closed down<br />
[18:23:01] <strong>shareholder2</strong> suddenly<br />

[18:23:08] <strong>shareholder2</strong> yes<br />
[18:23:08] <strong>nefario</strong> ffs<br />
[18:23:21] <strong>chrisrico</strong> you're unbelievable, nefario<br />
[18:23:29] <strong>shareholder1</strong> I forget the part where we had a motion to hire a lawyer<br />
[18:23:35] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> well nefario said that he thought that it was in a grey area and now its red<br />
[18:23:45] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> simple and yes, noone likes it but it the truth<br />
[18:23:50] <strong>shareholder2</strong> he spent my money on making my money vanish<br />
[18:23:52] <strong>shareholder2</strong> that's the truth<br />
[18:23:53] <strong>shareholder4</strong> how much of our BTC was spent on lawyers?<br />
[18:24:02] <strong>shareholder2</strong> and his money too<br />
[18:24:08] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> and I thought the same, .. yes  thats how it is<br />
[18:24:10] <strong>shareholder1</strong> do we get a receipt ?<br />
[18:24:10] <strong>chrisrico</strong> nefario made some decisions with consequences he cannot live with, and is now saving his own ass at our expense<br />
[18:24:18] <strong>shareholder2</strong> exactly<br />
[18:24:22] <strong>shareholder4</strong> prettyi much<br />
[18:24:23] <strong>shareholder2</strong> what a shameful exit<br />
[18:25:09] <strong>chrisrico</strong> and somehow he thinks that many in the bitcoin community will want to do business with a ceo who hijacks the company for selfish reasons<br />
[18:25:33] <strong>shareholder2</strong> yes, GLBSE legal will be a graet success<br />
[18:25:35] <strong>shareholder2</strong> just wait<br />
[18:25:38] <strong>da2ce796</strong> chrisrico: and you are not also acting out of shelfish reasons?<br />
[18:25:38] <strong>shareholder1</strong> because I spent the coins an nefarios lawyers I cant hire my own lol<br />
[18:25:49] <strong>shareholder2</strong> he will be able to afford  the lawyer for 2 weeks<br />
[18:26:12] <strong>chrisrico</strong> da2ce796: I'm not fucking anyone over in my stead, though<br />
[18:26:41] <strong>da2ce796</strong> chrisrico: well I think that you can just foregt about your 250 btc.<br />
[18:26:52] <strong>chrisrico</strong> da2ce796: why is that?<br />
[18:26:59] <strong>da2ce796</strong> cause they have been spent.<br />
[18:27:04] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> nefario, can you comment of the lawyer stuff? costs, how it not only covers you but the entiure glbse operation, etc.?<br />
[18:27:21] <strong>shareholder1</strong> https://cuces.soc.srcf.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/1309300880715.jpg<br />
[18:27:23] <strong>shareholder2</strong> they've been spent on a lawyer so that you can't possibly have your 250 BTC back in the future<br />
[18:27:28] <strong>shareholder2</strong> that's the irony of it<br />
[18:27:46] <strong>nefario</strong> I've not spent any funds on the lawyer yet<br />
[18:27:53] <strong>shareholder1</strong> at least he never bought cocaine with it<br />
[18:28:02] <strong>nefario</strong> does not mean there will not be a bill<br />
[18:28:06] <strong>shareholder2</strong> nefario: but they have been deducted as such in the financial statement?<br />
[18:28:15] <strong>shareholder2</strong> well, then it's spent<br />
[18:28:25] <strong>nefario</strong> no<br />
[18:28:37] <strong>chrisrico</strong> nefario: is this the same lawyer that is representing you personally?<br />
[18:28:39] <strong>shareholder2</strong> ?_? what was the huge costs about then?<br />
[18:28:42] <strong>nefario</strong> ColdHardMetal and I've not had the chance to communicate properly before this meeting<br />
[18:28:44] <strong>shareholder2</strong> development and marketing costs<br />
[18:28:46] <strong>chrisrico</strong> are you paying him with company funds for both roles?<br />
[18:28:59] <strong>nefario</strong> chrisrico: I'm not being represented personally by a lawyer<br />
[18:29:09] <strong>nefario</strong> for GLBSE only<br />
[18:29:19] <strong>chrisrico</strong> [16:36] <strong>nefario</strong> but the one who is representing me has said that I shouldn't say much<br />
[18:29:21] <strong>da2ce796</strong> lol... ok well I'm sick of thise meeting... nefario anything you want help with, just ask.<br />

[18:33:46] <strong>shareholder4</strong> nefario: will you require AML?<br />
[18:33:54] <strong>nefario</strong> yes<br />
[18:34:04] <strong>shareholder4</strong> even for small sums?<br />
[18:34:11] <strong>nefario</strong> for everything<br />
[18:34:29] <strong>shareholder4</strong> disagree<br />
[18:34:50] <strong>nefario</strong> ColdHardMetal: you're left to vote on this<br />
[18:35:02] <strong>shareholder1</strong> I just wan this to be over ffs.<br />
[18:35:03] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> just a sec<br />
[18:35:06] <strong>shareholder2</strong> nefario: 578.45 development expense was (partly) for the lawyer?<br />
[18:35:09] <strong>shareholder2</strong> just so i understand<br />
[18:35:14] <strong>shareholder2</strong> or whas it marketing/rental<br />
[18:35:26] <strong>nefario</strong> all dev expenses are for dv<br />
[18:35:28] <strong>nefario</strong> dev<br />
[18:35:37] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> no, I lumped some unknonws in there.<br />
[18:35:41] <strong>shareholder2</strong> ok, then where are the lawyer expenses in the income statement?<br />
[18:35:57] <strong>nefario</strong> the lawyer has not been paid yet<br />
[18:36:04] <strong>shareholder1</strong> they havent been paid yet<br />
[18:36:11] <strong>nefario</strong> being in the UK I have a serious cash flow problem<br />
[18:36:13] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> then you need yo account for some funds.<br />
[18:36:14] <strong>shareholder2</strong> and it's not in the income statement yet?<br />
[18:36:21] <strong>nefario</strong> no<br />
[18:36:24] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> because I don't know where they went.<br />
[18:36:27] <strong>shareholder1</strong> whatever coins we have left will go to the lawyer :P<br />
[18:36:30] <strong>shareholder2</strong> niiiiiiice<br />
[18:36:40] <strong>theymos</strong> We shouldn't pay it. Let Nefario deal with his bills.<br />
[18:36:45] <strong>shareholder2</strong> then we probably won't have any money left<br />
[18:36:50] <strong>shareholder1</strong> yep<br />
[18:36:52] <strong>shareholder2</strong> or GLBSE might even be in debt<br />
[18:36:53] <strong>chrisrico</strong> nefario: how do you we know you're not lying to us and are going to take the money and run?<br />
[18:37:03] <strong>shareholder1</strong> we will need to pay more money :P<br />
[18:37:11] <strong>chrisrico</strong> you've given us no evidence or information to support your claims<br />
[18:37:12] <strong>nefario</strong> I have ALL THE OTHER DEPOSITOR MONEY<br />
[18:37:14] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> nefario, jyou need to provide visibility on the lawyer rates and for a cost estimate of him<br />
[18:37:25] <strong>nefario</strong> sure<br />
[18:37:33] <strong>shareholder1</strong> GLBSE is insolvent ?<br />
[18:37:35] <strong>nefario</strong> I'll get reciepts from him when expenses come<br />
[18:37:47] <strong>chrisrico</strong> nefario: you don't know the rate of the lawyer?<br />
[18:37:49] <strong>nefario</strong> this is just like the forums<br />
[18:37:50] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> but you must ask before what it costs<br />
[18:37:53] <strong>shareholder2</strong> are you still using this lawyer at GLBSE cost?<br />
[18:37:56] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i suggest you stop that<br />
[18:37:56] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> that is standard practice<br />
[18:38:02] <strong>shareholder2</strong> because you can't fucking afford it<br />
[18:38:27] <strong>shareholder2</strong> seeing as the current income is \85 negative<br />
[18:38:28] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> yeah. you need to stop spending money.<br />
[18:38:31] <strong>shareholder1</strong> I dont agree to being liable for a debt if GLBSe cant cover it<br />
[18:38:47] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder1: you won't be<br />
[18:38:50] <strong>shareholder4</strong> shareholder1: you're not<br />
[18:39:10] <strong>nefario</strong> the lawyer costs are not a problem<br />
[18:39:13] <strong>shareholder2</strong> orly<br />
[18:39:17] <strong>shareholder1</strong> ok<br />
[18:39:17] <strong>shareholder2</strong> who's going to pay for it?<br />
[18:39:19] <strong>nefario</strong> yes<br />
[18:39:20] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> nefario - can you comitt to present us with the costs of this lawyer?<br />
[18:39:31] <strong>nefario</strong> I can when I get them<br />
[18:39:32] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i thought bitcoinglobal was paying for it<br />
[18:39:51] <strong>nefario</strong> ColdHardMetal: vote on the motion<br />
[18:40:08] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> let me figure out who voted what first.<br />
[18:40:13] <strong>shareholder2</strong> why do you use a motion if you wouldn't be following the result of a motion yourself?<br />
[18:40:18] <strong>shareholder2</strong> you have openly stated that<br />
[18:40:54] <strong>shareholder1</strong> shareholder2 we cant operate glbse since nefario has the database and user info<br />
[18:41:02] <strong>shareholder2</strong> we can<br />
[18:41:05] <strong>chrisrico</strong> because in THIS case, THEYMOS has the money that NEFARIO wants<br />
[18:41:06] <strong>shareholder1</strong> So theres literally nothing we can do<br />
[18:41:27] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> guys, lets do this together, fighting internally does not help<br />
[18:41:31] <strong>nefario</strong> chrisrico: that is users money, not GLBSE's<br />
[18:41:40] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> lets finish the motion and move forward<br />
[18:41:44] <strong>nefario</strong> I don't want it, I'm happy for coldhardmetal to hold it<br />
[18:42:13] <strong>nefario</strong> we're waiting for cold to toll up the votes so far<br />
[18:42:15] <strong>chrisrico</strong> theymos can hold it<br />
[18:42:17] <strong>shareholder1</strong> I trust chm to do the right thing with it<br />
[18:42:42] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> 57.85% for. My vote doesn't matter. Motion carries.<br />
[18:42:51] <strong>shareholder2</strong> that's funny<br />
[18:43:09] <strong>shareholder2</strong> nefario who wouldn't observe the result of a motion concerning him forces theymos to do so<br />
[18:43:12] <strong>shareholder2</strong> oh well<br />
[18:43:17] <strong>chrisrico</strong> what happened with the vote to remove nefario as CEO?<br />
[18:43:24] <strong>chrisrico</strong> out of curiousity<br />
[18:43:24] <strong>shareholder1</strong> didnt pass<br />
[18:43:24] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> didn;t pass<br />
[18:43:31] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder2: I've not violated the results of any motions<br />
[18:43:34] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> so what else<br />
[18:43:38] <strong>chrisrico</strong> nefario: you stated that you would<br />
[18:43:42] <strong>shareholder2</strong> you stated your intent that you would not<br />
[18:43:51] <strong>theymos</strong> nefario: You're violating the bylaws.<br />
[18:43:52] <strong>shareholder2</strong> maybe it affected the motion<br />
[18:43:54] <strong>nefario</strong> ColdHardMetal: give theymos a BTC address for him to send you the remaining GLBSE user funds he holds<br />
[18:43:54] <strong>shareholder4</strong> can we vote on how to handle the shutdown<br />
[18:43:58] <strong>shareholder4</strong> ?<br />
[18:44:06] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> given that nefario remaisn CEO, lets ask him the questions we want to get answered and he needs to get back to us with answers asap<br />
[18:44:13] <strong>chrisrico</strong> shareholder4: nope, that's up to nefario and his, I mean OUR lawyer<br />
[18:44:20] <strong>shareholder2</strong> our lawyer<br />
[18:44:20] <strong>shareholder2</strong> lol<br />
[18:44:24] <strong>shareholder1</strong> lol<br />
[18:44:36] <strong>chrisrico</strong> nefario: given that we are paying for this lawyer, please give us his contact information<br />
[18:44:38] <strong>shareholder4</strong> chrisrico: yes but just fot the lulz<br />
[18:44:42] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> not about the legal stuff, but the shutdown process i mean<br />
[18:44:51] <strong>chrisrico</strong> *his or her<br />
[18:44:55] <strong>shareholder1</strong> yes what is the lawyers contact info<br />

[18:45:17] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> nefario?<br />
[18:45:32] <strong>chrisrico</strong> and, the lawyer who is handling this, what is their name?<br />
[18:45:32] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> might as well. I don;t want to touch it.<br />
[18:45:41] <strong>da2ce796</strong> ok...<br />
[18:45:42] <strong>shareholder1</strong> can users contact the lawyer ?<br />
[18:45:46] <strong>da2ce796</strong> anything else...<br />
[18:45:51] <strong>chrisrico</strong> to whom should I ask to speak regarding this matter?<br />
[18:45:53] <strong>nefario</strong> michael buckworth<br />
[18:46:03] <strong>shareholder2</strong> exactly, it is OUR lawyer<br />
[18:46:08] <strong>shareholder2</strong> so you have to tell us everything<br />
[18:46:08] <strong>nefario</strong> but he won't talk to you about any details<br />
[18:46:18] <strong>shareholder2</strong> this is our funds that are financing him<br />
[18:46:28] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i want full transparency now<br />
[18:46:31] <strong>chrisrico</strong> he is our lawyer, is he not?<br />
[18:46:34] <strong>da2ce796</strong> lol<br />
[18:46:37] <strong>shareholder1</strong> lol<br />
[18:46:38] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> i suggest whoever whats to call him does it and see what he says.<br />
[18:46:44] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> in the meanwhile lets move on<br />
[18:46:46] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> what else?<br />
[18:46:48] <strong>da2ce796</strong> nefario == GLBSE<br />
[18:46:50] <strong>shareholder4</strong> nefario: will we provide a way to migrate assets elsewhere?<br />
[18:46:54] <strong>da2ce796</strong> don't you guys get it.<br />
[18:46:55] <strong>da2ce796</strong> :P<br />
[18:46:59] <strong>chrisrico</strong> da2ce796: in what way, exactly?<br />
[18:47:03] <strong>da2ce796</strong> chrisrico: legaly.<br />
[18:47:06] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> shareholder4 great question<br />
[18:47:09] <strong>chrisrico</strong> da2ce796: according to whom?<br />
[18:47:17] <strong>da2ce796</strong> the UK state<br />
[18:47:21] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i didn't sign up for nefario == glbse when i gave him money<br />
[18:47:22] <strong>shareholder1</strong> chrisrico technically we dont exist<br />
[18:47:25] <strong>shareholder2</strong> didn't sign up for UK either<br />
[18:47:27] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder4: yes, I'll try to make the process of moving off GLBSE as smooth and painless as possible<br />
[18:47:29] <strong>chrisrico</strong> da2ce796: ah, but GLBSE isn't incorporated in the UK<br />
[18:47:50] <strong>shareholder1</strong> but nefario used his credit card :P<br />
[18:47:51] <strong>shareholder4</strong> nefario: fair enough, thanks<br />
[18:47:52] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> nafaria, can you send around a draft announcement and we can comment on it before you release it?<br />
[18:47:57] <strong>shareholder2</strong> my money is now financing a lawyer whose advice i am not allowed to hear<br />
[18:47:57] <strong>da2ce796</strong> chrisrico: but dose something have to be  incorporated to break the law?<br />
[18:48:00] <strong>da2ce796</strong> lol<br />
[18:48:09] <strong>shareholder2</strong> and that's fucked up<br />
[18:48:09] <strong>da2ce796</strong> anyway I need to get back to my morning.<br />
[18:48:11] <strong>chrisrico</strong> da2ce796: um, no. but that means nefario broke the law, not GLBSE<br />
[18:48:21] <strong>shareholder1</strong> the mafia isnt incorporated either<br />
[18:48:24] <strong>da2ce796</strong> chrisrico: I think that you just need to get over it.<br />
[18:48:38] <strong>chrisrico</strong> good thing I don't really care what you think<br />
[18:48:53] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> nafaria, can you send around a draft announcement and we can comment on it before you release it?<br />
[18:48:59] <strong>shareholder2</strong> why did nefario not consult a lawyer before starting GLBSE?<br />
[18:49:02] <strong>shareholder1</strong> ^^^<br />
[18:49:03] <strong>shareholder2</strong> if that's so important<br />
[18:49:18] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> thats water under the bridge<br />
[18:49:19] <strong>shareholder1</strong> because we hadnt paid for it yet ?<br />
[18:49:20] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder2, shareholder1, it wasn't a problem for you when we started before<br />
[18:49:25] <strong>shareholder2</strong> ok<br />
[18:49:31] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> thanks<br />
[18:49:34] <strong>shareholder2</strong> then i want full transparency since it's our lawyer<br />
[18:49:53] <strong>shareholder2</strong> anything else is dishonest, nefario<br />
[18:49:57] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder2: then you'll have to give your AML info to me and take the same risk I am for GLBSE<br />
[18:50:14] <strong>chrisrico</strong> oh how the goal posts shift<br />
[18:50:16] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> ^^^^ agree, but shareholder2 there may be specifics related to nefario only that he cant release<br />
[18:50:23] <strong>shareholder1</strong> I don t have a problem I just think it coulda been handled better with more notice<br />
[18:50:29] <strong>chrisrico</strong> but nefario stated that the lawyer is NOT representing him, ONLY glbse<br />
[18:50:43] <strong>nefario</strong> since GLBSE is not a legal entity<br />
[18:50:45] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i thought nefario = glbse?<br />
[18:50:47] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> ^^^^ nefario?<br />
[18:50:49] <strong>nefario</strong> I am representing GLBSE<br />
[18:50:52] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> you should answer this<br />
[18:50:57] <strong>chrisrico</strong> so the lawyer is for you personally, then<br />
[18:51:01] <strong>chrisrico</strong> and is being paid with GLBSE funds?<br />
[18:51:07] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> its both, chris<br />
[18:51:33] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> and it makes sense as he is exposed<br />
[18:51:47] <strong>shareholder2</strong> nefario: i hope for you that you are forced by authorities<br />
[18:51:55] <strong>shareholder2</strong> and that it will come out sometime later<br />
[18:52:00] <strong>shareholder2</strong> otherwise your reputation is ruined<br />
[18:52:04] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> and takes the resposibility (which is a good sign. have you heard nefario blaming us?)<br />
[18:52:21] <strong>shareholder2</strong> shutting down GLBSE on a whim because you suddenly don't feel too well about it and consult a lawyer<br />
[18:52:45] <strong>chrisrico</strong> well, all I can say is that I will do everything within my power to make it known that nefario is not to be trusted within the bitcoin community, since that is the only option available to me<br />
[18:53:04] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> how will this help anyone chris?<br />
[18:53:13] <strong>shareholder2</strong> shareholder3_: it'll help future investors<br />
[18:53:17] <strong>chrisrico</strong> it will help those who may otherwise make the mistake of going into business with nefario in the future<br />
[18:53:21] <strong>shareholder2</strong> and future customers<br />
[18:53:41] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> of clourse you can do what you want, but it would be better for you and everyone to help the wind down of glbse in a clean way<br />
[18:53:45] <strong>shareholder2</strong> but as i said, i hope he is really doing this at GUNPOINT<br />
[18:53:48] <strong>nefario</strong> these are the basic facts the announcement needs to convey: 1) GLBSE is closing, 2) All BTC will be returned to users, 3) Users need to AML, 4) Issuers who are not already verifified will need to do AML, 5) Issuers who have been AML'd will be given all support to move off GLBSE, 6) Users AML'd will be given all support to move their assets off GLBSE<br />
[18:53:48] <strong>shareholder2</strong> not at a whim<br />
[18:53:49] <strong>chrisrico</strong> THIS IS NOT CLEAN<br />
[18:53:52] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> without starting open accusations<br />
[18:54:14] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> its not a whim, according to what nefario said<br />
[18:54:19] <strong>chrisrico</strong> just wait until the community finds out they can't get a single satoshi of theirs back without providing whatever identifying information the UK government deems necessary<br />
[18:54:23] <strong>chrisrico</strong> you think that will be clean?<br />
[18:54:23] <strong>shareholder2</strong> shareholder3_: where did he say that?<br />
[18:54:36] <strong>shareholder2</strong> this is really all i understood from it<br />
[18:54:47] <strong>shareholder4</strong> i don't think the man is really requiring all this AML<br />
[18:54:52] <strong>chrisrico</strong> and all because nefario can't live up to his own decisions, rather than taking everyone down in his place<br />
[18:54:56] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> clearly impl\F6ying it<br />
[18:55:00] <strong>shareholder2</strong> basically, he went to that london conference, talked to a lawyer sometime who frightened him<br />
[18:55:06] <strong>shareholder1</strong> I doubt he is doing it on a whim<br />
[18:55:15] <strong>shareholder4</strong> how about we ask AML only above a threshold?<br />
[18:55:19] <strong>shareholder2</strong> shareholder1: i i hope he's not<br />
[18:55:24] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i don't want him to be a scammer<br />
[18:55:28] <strong>chrisrico</strong> what probably happened is that he tried to get the ball rolling on legitimizing GLBSE, which got his ass in legal trouble<br />
[18:55:29] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> again, water under the bridge. all fine with the aoouncment content?<br />
[18:55:43] <strong>shareholder2</strong> chrisrico: makes sense also<br />
[18:55:55] <strong>shareholder4</strong> shareholder3_: not really fine with the AML<br />
[18:56:03] <strong>chrisrico</strong> ^^^<br />
[18:56:04] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i believe he wanted to incorporate<br />
[18:56:06] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> again ^^^this is the only viable option for all shareholders<br />
[18:56:08] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder4: I've talked about this with the lawyer, because there is no way to prove that one person hasn't oppened dozens of accounts with smaller amounts we have to do aml for everyone<br />
[18:56:10] <strong>shareholder2</strong> around the time of the conference<br />
[18:56:19] <strong>chrisrico</strong> yes, and he started doing so without approval of the shareholders<br />
[18:56:23] <strong>chrisrico</strong> this should all be on nefario, not us<br />
[18:56:24] <strong>shareholder4</strong> getting people money and then requirning AML to get it back is not ethical<br />
[18:56:38] <strong>shareholder2</strong> chrisrico: yep. shareholders didn't have the chance to get out before he closed it<br />
[18:56:40] <strong>da2ce796</strong> shareholder4: mtgox did that<br />
[18:56:52] <strong>shareholder4</strong> da2ce796: so what?<br />
[18:56:56] <strong>chrisrico</strong> da2ce796: mtgox didn't shut down<br />
[18:57:03] <strong>da2ce796</strong> so that was one of the legal costs.<br />
[18:57:19] <strong>chrisrico</strong> da2ce796: the legal costs of CONTINUING TO OPERATE<br />
[18:57:27] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> is there anything else to be decided today.. just asking. havent slept for 36 hours.. but if its important, I will stay<br />
[18:57:30] <strong>shareholder4</strong> I suppose a motion about that would be ignored?<br />
[18:57:31] <strong>shareholder2</strong> mtgox didn't shut down because it suddenly realized it is illegal<br />
[18:57:31] <strong>da2ce796</strong> chrisrico: no, of not going to jail.<br />
[18:57:37] <strong>chrisrico</strong> shareholder3_: there was never anything to be decided at all<br />
[18:57:44] <strong>nefario</strong> yes there is<br />
[18:57:48] <strong>shareholder1</strong> nefario one question. Do we have any companies who have promised to ipo on a l;egal glbse ?<br />
[18:57:50] <strong>nefario</strong> well<br />
[18:57:53] <strong>nefario</strong> no actually<br />
[18:58:02] <strong>chrisrico</strong> what was that stuff you mentioned from the last shareholder meeting?<br />
[18:58:11] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder1: yes<br />
[18:58:14] <strong>chrisrico</strong> the "big news" that you couldn't share?<br />
[18:58:16] <strong>chrisrico</strong> oh<br />
[18:58:17] <strong>shareholder2</strong> he left us in the dark ever since the london conference<br />
[18:58:28] <strong>da2ce796</strong> ok... anything else for this meeting???<br />
[18:58:28] <strong>shareholder2</strong> since that time, a lawyer has been in charge of GLBSE<br />
[18:58:31] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> nefario?<br />
[18:58:36] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder2: you could have come<br />
[18:58:38] <strong>da2ce796</strong> becasue I want to get going?<br />
[18:58:54] <strong>chrisrico</strong> go<br />
[18:58:59] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder3_: I don't think there are any other important motions<br />
[18:59:11] <strong>nefario</strong> unless we need a motion to close down GLBSE<br />
[18:59:25] <strong>nefario</strong> ColdHardMetal: do we need a motion for that?<br />
[18:59:28] <strong>shareholder4</strong> nefario: do we need one?<br />
[18:59:29] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> neafario, you must share this info to shareholders. you can aks them to keep it confidential and if breached this person will be punished<br />
[18:59:32] <strong>nefario</strong> it doesn't mean the end of BG yet<br />
[18:59:59] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> what were those big news nefario?<br />
[19:00:09] <strong>nefario</strong> BitPay<br />
[19:00:18] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> tell us more<br />
[19:00:20] <strong>shareholder2</strong> what about them?<br />
[19:00:36] <strong>nefario</strong> wanted to IPO when we sorted out legal shit out<br />
[19:00:50] <strong>shareholder1</strong> thats what i thought<br />
[19:00:54] <strong>shareholder2</strong> same<br />
[19:01:02] <strong>nefario</strong> also<br />
[19:01:05] <strong>shareholder2</strong> so bitpay killed GLBSE by having you trying to legalize it<br />
[19:01:08] <strong>shareholder1</strong> I hope you charge them more than 8 btc lol<br />
[19:01:10] <strong>shareholder2</strong> funny<br />
[19:01:29] <strong>chrisrico</strong> nefario: have you determined if, complying with UK financial regulations, citizens of other countries can invest bitcoin in BG legally?<br />
[19:01:38] <strong>chrisrico</strong> and that they can do so in amounts as small as we have done?<br />
[19:01:50] <strong>shareholder1</strong> BFL needs to help since we give them so much business :P<br />
[19:01:53] <strong>shareholder2</strong> nefario, you should check this https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=115669.0<br />
[19:02:04] <strong>shareholder2</strong> it's a taste of what's going to come i guess<br />
[19:02:10] <strong>nefario</strong> chrisrico: unless your country specifically says you can't invest in a UK company then you can<br />
[19:02:36] <strong>chrisrico</strong> so there are no UK regulations regarding foreign investment, or sizes of allowable investment, in UK companies?<br />
[19:03:04] <strong>nefario</strong> I'm sure there are<br />
[19:03:14] <strong>nefario</strong> but it doesn't stop you investing<br />
[19:03:15] <strong>nefario</strong> or being a shareholder<br />
[19:03:23] <strong>chrisrico</strong> unless there are regulations preventing it...<br />
[19:03:36] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder2: thats a really nice link.<br />
[19:03:46] <strong>chrisrico</strong> in the U.S., the SEC only allows "accredited investors" to invest in companies<br />
[19:03:46] <strong>shareholder2</strong> yeah. i guess goat got what he wanted<br />
[19:03:49] <strong>shareholder2</strong> as well as mpex<br />
[19:04:05] <strong>shareholder1</strong> its gonna be impossible to do anything with a scammer tag :P<br />
[19:04:09] <strong>shareholder2</strong> looking forward to MPOE-PR<br />
[19:04:20] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder3_: I stopped using the forum<br />
[19:04:48] <strong>nefario</strong> thats really nice theymos<br />
[19:04:58] <strong>nefario</strong> couldn't even wait until the meeting was finished<br />
[19:05:01] <strong>chrisrico</strong> are the people you were talking to at BitPay aware of the circumstances of the GLBSE shutdown?<br />
[19:05:11] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> nefario, where will you communicate the closing process<br />
[19:05:13] <strong>chrisrico</strong> oh, quit acting like a victim here nefario<br />
[19:05:31] <strong>shareholder1</strong> yeah youre not gonna be able to offer shares to non accredited US investors<br />
[19:05:33] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder3_: email and the GLBSE site<br />
[19:05:42] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> ok<br />
[19:05:52] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> i will leave now, unless there is anything else to be decided<br />
[19:06:09] <strong>shareholder2</strong> nefario: couldn't even wait until he finished selling, either<br />
[19:06:13] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder3_: see you<br />
[19:06:25] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> one last plea: internal accusations like the one theymos just did do not help anyone, sleep all over it, please<br />
[19:06:26] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> gnight shareholder3<br />
[19:06:34] <strong>shareholder4</strong> shareholder3_: goodnight<br />
[19:06:42] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> nite<br />
[19:06:42] <strong>shareholder2</strong> cu<br />
[19:06:46] <strong>shareholder3_</strong> cu<br />
[19:06:47] <strong>chrisrico</strong> ColdHardMetal: what's your take on all this?<br />
[19:07:00] *** shareholder3_ Quit IRC (Quit: Page closed)<br />
[19:07:08] <strong>chrisrico</strong> you've been awfully quiet...<br />
[19:07:27] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> It's a mess. I odn;t really see any other way out though.<br />
[19:07:56] <strong>chrisrico</strong> for nefario, you mean? what about everyone else?<br />
[19:08:02] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder2: you have no issue selling something you know will be closed?<br />
[19:08:15] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i didn't know at the time<br />
[19:08:26] <strong>shareholder1</strong> Its useless sellin gshares since the site wont exist<br />
[19:08:30] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i only knew you wanted to take it legal<br />
[19:08:41] <strong>chrisrico</strong> yes, nefario has uniltaterally  made our shares worthless<br />
[19:08:42] <strong>shareholder2</strong> and we wanted to find people who wanted to own a piece of that<br />
[19:08:54] <strong>shareholder2</strong> so that you have more consent<br />
[19:08:58] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> for any of us really. Nef i going to shut it down regardless, so comlaining abou tit doesn't help.<br />
[19:09:00] <strong>shareholder2</strong> it would have been mutually good<br />
[19:09:08] <strong>shareholder1</strong> what CHM says<br />
[19:09:18] <strong>shareholder2</strong> and you knew about it, since we talked about it last meeting<br />
[19:09:38] <strong>shareholder2</strong> oh, nvm. i see what you guys mean now<br />
[19:09:45] <strong>shareholder2</strong> well, i blame him for closing it, then<br />
[19:09:50] <strong>shareholder2</strong> without our consetn<br />
[19:10:09] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i can only hope, as i said, that he is doing so at gunpoint<br />
[19:10:32] <strong>shareholder2</strong> at least then theymos' accusations would be unjustified<br />
[19:11:27] <strong>shareholder4</strong> nefario: will you honor BG shares when you open the new legit company?<br />
[19:11:41] <strong>chrisrico</strong> only if you submit AML information :)<br />
[19:11:46] <strong>shareholder2</strong> hahahahahahaha<br />
[19:11:53] <strong>shareholder2</strong> he said he would, yes<br />
[19:11:55] <strong>shareholder4</strong> chrisrico: of course<br />
[19:12:00] <strong>shareholder2</strong> at what rate is the question :P<br />
[19:12:24] <strong>shareholder4</strong> I was thinking they could be made some sort of stock options<br />
[19:12:32] <strong>chrisrico</strong> whatever rate nefario (GLBSE) decides<br />
[19:12:39] <strong>shareholder4</strong> so that they can be traded to interested people<br />
[19:13:10] <strong>shareholder1</strong> it wont matter if he issues 4 million shares and we only have the same amount<br />
[19:13:41] <strong>shareholder2</strong> he cannot do business in bitcoin world anymore<br />
[19:13:53] <strong>nefario</strong> thankshi<br />
[19:13:54] <strong>nefario</strong> sorry<br />
[19:13:55] <strong>shareholder2</strong> i mean, it will be hard to<br />
[19:14:02] <strong>nefario</strong> got a phone call as a result of the forum post<br />
[19:14:09] <strong>shareholder1</strong> ah<br />
[19:14:10] <strong>da2ce796</strong> ColdHardMetal: has the meeting been adjourned?<br />
[19:14:46] <strong>chrisrico</strong> maybe you should ask nefario<br />
[19:14:48] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder4: yes, current shares will be honored<br />
[19:14:50] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> Well, is there anything else to discuss? Nefario is going to write a statement and send it around for input?<br />
[19:15:01] <strong>shareholder2</strong> nefario: i'm sorry if you *really* are being forced to do it for the shit i gave you<br />
[19:15:06] <strong>chrisrico</strong> why is our input necessary? we're only shareholders<br />
[19:15:36] <strong>nefario</strong> also<br />
[19:15:36] <strong>shareholder2</strong> chrisrico: agreed, nefario = glbse will decide anyway<br />
[19:15:49] <strong>nefario</strong> theymos has thrown his version out on the forum anyway<br />
[19:16:06] <strong>chrisrico</strong> his version? are there inaccuracies?<br />
[19:16:10] <strong>nefario</strong> I think I'll keep it simple and to the fact<br />
[19:16:25] <strong>shareholder2</strong> his version seems true to me<br />
[19:16:40] <strong>nefario</strong> I disagree<br />
[19:16:43] <strong>shareholder2</strong> only i think it would be wrong to call him a scammer if the state forces him<br />
[19:17:03] <strong>chrisrico</strong> I think he is still a scammer regardless<br />
[19:17:21] <strong>shareholder2</strong> why? should he go to prison for not complying to their orders?<br />
[19:17:23] <strong>shareholder1</strong> nefario will they be in the same proportion even after a share split ?<br />
[19:17:37] <strong>nefario</strong> you're entitled to your opinion<br />
[19:17:40] <strong>chrisrico</strong> he made the decisions which led to him getting in trouble with the state (if that is the case). rather than face up to those decisions, he chose to fuck the shareholders, users, and investors over<br />
[19:17:51] <strong>nefario</strong> shareholder1: share split hasn't gone ahead<br />
[19:17:59] <strong>nefario</strong> so it will be as they currently stand<br />
[19:18:08] <strong>shareholder1</strong> chrisrico no we also made that decision by investing<br />
[19:18:28] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> alright. I guess we're done.<br />
[19:18:30] <strong>chrisrico</strong> shareholder1: what decision? to give nefario supreme power to shut down our company against our will?<br />
[19:18:39] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> can I get a motion to adjourn?<br />
[19:18:50] <strong>shareholder1</strong> nefario isnt shutting it down the state is<br />
[19:18:51] <strong>da2ce796</strong> I motion that we adjourn<br />
[19:18:55] <strong>chrisrico</strong> no, nefario is<br />
[19:18:56] <strong>nefario</strong> I propose we adjourn<br />
[19:18:56] <strong>shareholder1</strong> aye<br />
[19:19:03] <strong>chrisrico</strong> he has given us NO evidence that he is in legal distress<br />
[19:19:07] <strong>nefario</strong> I second that motion<br />
[19:19:08] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> seconder?<br />
[19:19:15] <strong>shareholder2</strong> chrisrico: i'm not sure he made a decision. it depends whether this is a result of himtrying to incorporate or if this is maybe fallout from pirate<br />
[19:19:16] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> ok, all in favor?<br />
[19:19:25] <strong>shareholder4</strong> aye<br />
[19:19:26] <strong>da2ce796</strong> aye<br />
[19:19:27] <strong>nefario</strong> aye<br />
[19:19:29] <strong>chrisrico</strong> aye<br />
[19:19:30] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> aye<br />
[19:19:35] <strong>shareholder2</strong> yes<br />
[19:19:41] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> motioon carries.<br />
[19:19:41] <strong>shareholder2</strong> chrisrico: remember the pirate pass throughs on GLBSE and the SEC investigation<br />
[19:19:56] <strong>chrisrico</strong> shareholder2: and?<br />
[19:20:01] <strong>ColdHardMetal</strong> meeting adjourned at 1:20 am GMT October 6th, 2012</p>

						<p>Nah, I think pumping up scams is just what he does naturally. Gets to feel like he belongs with the "in crowd" or whatever. </p>
<p>On which score I eagerly await ASICMINER blowing up by spring, so that'll make three for him too and you can have his head.</p>
