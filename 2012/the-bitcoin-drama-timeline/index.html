<p><strong>13 June 2011</strong> "Allinvain" announces the loss of ~25`000 BTC (all mined). The proximate cause would be the idiocy of Bitcoin-qt developers, who released about five versions of the thing before making the wallet encryptable. Consequently, <strong>for years</strong>, someone could lose all his coins simply by having one file read. Yes, they were that fucking stupid.</p>
<p><strong>Total loss</strong>: 25k BTC (declared).</p>

<p>Amusingly, reports about the security such as it was having been breached were trickling in for weeks prior. Tis impossible to evaluate the actual loss with this one, but suffice it to observe that BTC was temporarily trading for 1 cent at the time.</p>

<p><strong>26 July 2011</strong> Bitomat.pl, mostly serving the Polish exchange market goes down because "human error". </p>
<blockquote><p>On 26 July 2011 at about 11:00 PM, I noticed that bitcoin server was out of resources and I had to increase RAM. As a result of this operation, the virtual machine was deleted and all data lost, including bitcoin wallet and its backups.</p>
<p>I have established that data was lost because settings of the virtual machine were changed, although I didn’t change them myself. Amazon Web Services Company, which hosts our servers, says that the cleared machine has been set up to be irretrievably destroyed (including the data on the disks) at the shutdown.</p>
<p>I’m still trying to establish who has changed the settings and whether I will be able to recover the lost data. Unfortunately cooperation with Amazon Web Services is very difficult. As soon as I realized that my virtual machine was lost I have ordered AWS premium support, talked to the manager and asked for securing of the disk data. So far, without success.</p></blockquote>
<p>Basically, the guy kept his wallet.dat in a ramdisk which went away. </p>

A week later a mysterious Tom Williams announces that all ur BTC are belong to us. </p>
<blockquote><p>On Friday of last week we noticed that one of our pooled holding servers was missing a large amount of Bitcoins. After a prompt investigation we realized that the security of our SCI (Shopping Cart Interface) system had been breached by an unknown attacker.</p>
<p>Our response was rash, but necessary. We simply switched the system off until we could have system-wide forensics performed. The forensics took some time, as the system is quite complex by nature.</p>
<p>After weighing all of our options, we have realized that we have no option but to go into receivership. We will settle all accounts with a online claim process that we are currently in the process of working out.</p>
<p>We will release more detailed information about the security breach, the claim process, and our balance sheet in the next few days.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Dear User,<br />
Please read carefully the following critical announcement.</p>
<p>On Oct 5th 2011 Bitcoin7.com became the victim of a number of pre-planned hacker attacks. While our investigation is still going, evidence reveals that the attacks originated from Russia and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>The attack itself took action not only against the bitcoin7.com server but also against other websites and servers which were part of the same network. Eventually the hackers managed to breach into the network which subsequently lead to a major breach into the bitcoin7.com website.</p>
<p>As a result of the hacking, unknown individuals managed to gain full access to the site's main bitcoin depository/wallet and 2 of the 3 backup wallets.</p>
<p>In addition the hackers gained access to our user database.</p>
<p>Even though our faith in the bitcoin project and community remains as strong as it ever was, it is our responsibility to admit that the scale of the damage is far beyond our financial and physical capabilities.</p>
<p>This is why we have decided to cease the operation of bitcoin7.com and instead of investing in new technology and personnel that could possibly help us overcome this unfortunate situation, we decided that we'd rather gather all possible finances through all possible means and initiate a crisis plan for reimbursing the lost balances of our users.</p>
<p>This is also an open invitation to all interested investors which have interest in taking over the site at the only cost of recovering the stolen bitcoins.</p>
<p>The crisis plan will take action over the next 90 days. On behalf of the management of bitcoin7.com we want to apologize for this extremely stressful situation.</p>
<p>More specific updates will follow within the next 24 hours with detailed instructions about how to withdraw your funds.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's not quite clear whether the hack was genuine or a set-up, hoping to cash in on the moral hazard brought about the bitomat.pl takeover.</p>

<p><strong>13 July 2012</strong> Yet another dubious Bitcoinica "hack" which might have been theft etc. Basically, <a href="http://trilema.com/2012/amir-taaki-has-done-and-continues-to-do-huge-disservice-to-anyone-serious-involved-in-bitcoin/">Amir Taaki</a><sup><a href="#footnote_10_44660" id="identifier_10_44660" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="From his vanity page :
Amir Taaki was born 6 February 1988 in London, the eldest of three children of a Scottish-English mother and an Iranian father. From an early age Taaki took an interest in computer technology, teaching himself computer programming. After briefly attending several British universities, Taaki gravitated to the free software movement. Taaki assisted in the creation of SDL Collide, an extension of Simple DirectMedia Layer, an open source library used by video game developers. In 2006, Taaki became heavily involved in Crystal Space development under the pseudonym of genjix. He also developed a number of video games making use of free software, including the adventure game Crystal Core and the futuristic racer game Ecksdee. Taaki was also a participant in the Blender project Yo Frankie!. His experience with online gambling attracted him to the Bitcoin project. He founded a UK Bitcoin exchange called `Britcoin`, which was succeeded in 2011 by a new British exchange called Intersango, in which he is a principal. In April 2011, Taaki and Donald Norman established the Bitcoin Consultancy, a group focused on bitcoin project development.

<p>His explanation ? He was framed! He was framed by none other than Chinese millionaire/relic hunter Chen Jianhai, who (the story goes) admitted to this even, in a heartfelt face to face, when told to his suprise that "this is a matter of international intrigue" (and world diplomacy)<sup><a href="#footnote_12_44660" id="identifier_12_44660" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This may sound like I'm making it up just to paraphrase Seinfeld.

So let me get this straight... The guy basically robbed his girlfriend of tens of thousands of dollars and defaulted on a mortgage after using the money his mother gave him... on imaginary internet money?
or otherwise for being an unemployable jerkoff with delusions of self importance.">xvii</a></sup> announces his default in the funniest terms : he got out of pirate before it sunk which explains why it sinks him, he's going to make it right but please don't ask questions, he's got guns and something else. Literally :</p>
<blockquote><p>I am defaulting on my BDK.BND debt. Beyond this, I will no longer be honoring the contract in the form I originally laid out. I previously intended to empty my non-legal wife's (we personally consider ourselves married, but legally, we are individual and thus have rights we'd otherwise forfeit) 401(k). I obviously did not want to do this, but it became clear it was necessary as I was looking at $200-250/wk interest on this single debt while having been financially raped by loans to various members of the community (No, Pirate is not the primary cause of my distress. Please don't turn this into some Pirate discussion.). After weeks of tha stress, on top of previous stress... heated arguments... -- this is no longer an option. I do not think her response to my actions is unreasonable (she's already effectively lost tens of thousands due to my actions), but this clearly affects my ability to repay within what I'd consider a reasonable time-frame. I currently have a negative net worth excluding my residence which would be protected under a personal bankruptcy filing which I will not pursue unless a suit is formally filed against me. I'd advise against taking action on potential cynicism, and suggest you give me at least a couple months to confirm I am indeed making a decent effort toward repaying what I owe.</p>
<p>I am unable to pay interest on my current BDK.BND debt. It's impossible for me to keep up with that, living expenses, and interest on other debts which are small enough where I can close them - and I apologize, in a sense, for the unfairness of how this is being handled. BDK.BND-holders, who I've always wanted most protected from risk, are now getting the shaft. I cannot subject my wife to more loss, and will be forcing BDK.BND holders to suffer as a result of my unwillingness to liquidate my residence. I apologize for the trust I've violated, the business mismanagement, and this default as a result. If I were unable to compartmentalize, I would be unable to write this. I am truly and deeply sorry. I also apologize for not having the emotional fortitude to prevent what I'm also about to announce: I will not be communicating much, if at all. I will likely not read anything written in this thread beyond this post for months. I just can't handle it when there are many things I need to do to get the situation in order. I will not be responding to phone calls, Skype messages, nor responding to emails. I will not be clarifying what I've written, and will not be responding to questions. I just can't right now, and understand how bad that looks and is. Again, I apologize. I will post an impersonal message each time I make a dividend payment.</p>
<p>All BTC I currently own will go toward BDK.BND payments. These will come in the form of irregular, unannounced dividends -- there will no longer be .001BTC/bond dividends each week. I will never buy BDK.BND back, and that section of the contract can be considered practically void. I can do nothing but assure everyone that I have no intent to make any purchases of BDK.BND units, and will allow them to trade freely on GLBSE as people value them given I have absolutely no information on when, and in what amount, these bonds will be repaid. However, I promise I will repay the debt as it stands, as I'm able. So long as GLBSE is active, I am alive, and earning income, I will continue to make dividend payments on BDK.BND units as a gesture of goodwill (and appreciation for not suing me into bankruptcy) beyond the .101BTC "hard debt" I currently consider as existing. Basically - I will be making larger, more rapid payments until dividends beyond this date reach .101BTC/bond. After that time, I will continue paying irregular dividends in a way which is appropriate for the gratitude I owe, and possible for the amount I need to live. I am unable to provide a repayment schedule or dividend schedule. Essentially - I'm giving what I can without forcing an unreasonable amount of loss (beyond what I've currently caused) onto my non-legal wife, and I naively hope everyone trusts me to be doing exactly what I'm saying I will. I'll provide instructions in my will to give an update (with death certificate) on this forum in the event of my death. Though things have been pretty poo poo lately, I am not at all suicidal -- just gave the info in that last sentence as an FYI.</p>
<p>-Ben</p>
<p>(Additionally... Someone may remember I recently posted assets/liabilities on my side. This included many of my non-legal wife's assets. The CU/bank assets have been largely emptied to repay CD-holders and my mother, who fronted us money to purchase this house [I've since defaulted on that loan, too, after a partial repayment so I could repay CD-holders]. There is still one outstanding CD-holder who has been excessively generous in providing me time to repay.)</p>
<p>(Many individuals have my home address [NOT the Spring Arbor address. That is a family member's house. DO NOT release that address.]. I would prefer my home address not be released publicly, but would also not consider public release of that information unwarranted. If you are coming for a visit, I would like at least a voice message a day or two prior. Harm toward family's off-limits, and I would physically object to bodily harm which may result in my stay in a hospital, as that'd further impede repayment. I am armed, so please keep ideas of physical violence in check.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Quote from: nckrazze on September 10, 2012, 04:26:43 AM<br />
Mostly due to bad planning on my part as well as a large flow of coins at once and the rising difficulty rate, I was unable to continue my mining project and ended up liquidating most of it. Around July 18th, I had completely liquidated all of the mining hardware that belonged to the Deposits Service. I kept a bit over 2000$ worth of hardware for myself (which were my personal assets), to continue generating coins with. My funds remained dormant until August 6th, when I decided that the magnitude of the payouts was too great for the coins to be sitting around for. For this reason, I chose to place all the funds with pirate and continue to payout weekly interest until terms were over. As terms ended, I would not offer term renewals, and would return all of the coins to the depositors.</p></blockquote>

<p>The BFL board was reshuffled quietly and the matter is presently being ignored to the best of everyone's ability. Consequently, there's no loss to  associate with this item as of yet. The previous scam which resulted in the fraud conviction did cost the general public 19 million USD.</p>

<p><strong>Total loss</strong> : 3k BTC.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>28 September 2012</strong> Oliver Richman, aka Serena, Usagi &#038; al had been operating a number of various assets (NYAN.A, .B, .C purporting to be some sort of bonds ; CPA purporting to be some sort of insurer ; BMF purporting to be some sort of mining thing). Appaling accounting practices, cross-deals and inter-asset gifts in disregard of shareholder's rights, solidly reinforced by completely insane business moves (buying things known to be worthless for singificant premiums etc) pretty much ensured a complete loss for investors.</p>
<p>The holder proceeded to have a complete mental meltdown in the forum (posts since deleted), declared famously that milk is a scammer, possibly made some efforts to repay his investors out of selling his guitar and in any event was conveniently rescued by the collapse of GLBSE and ensuing drama the next week.</p>
<p><strong>Total loss</strong> : 1k BTC (estimated).</p>
<p>Late <strong>September 2012</strong> Patrick McFarland aka DiabloD3<sup><a href="#footnote_21_44660" id="identifier_21_44660" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Known for having written the first java miner for Bitcoin">xxii</a></sup> came up with the idea of a "million BTC company" sometime in April. This was going to be some sort of mining venture then modified to datacenter then eventually further modified to include electricity generation and other lines. </p>
<p>The subsequent GLBSE ipo yielded roughly 10k BTC for 10k shares. Unable to complete the original plan McFarland devised his own system for valuating miner bonds and proceeded to trade on the open market according to it, impervious to <a href="http://trilema.com/2012/lolvacute-pentru-posteritate/">warnings that both his system was broken</a> and that in any event his implementation is defective. </p>
<p>Once he unavoidably ran out of cash he proceeded to issue more shares, deeply diluting existing shareholders (new shares were issued for values at times below even 1% of what early investors had paid). Eventually GLBSE took control of the asset and forced a motion. At the time GLBSE management was acting in such an inept and erratic manner however (delisting spontaneously some other asset) that McFarland was returned as CEO. The audit promised by GLBSE never materialised and in any event the implosion of GLBSE a few weeks later sealed the deal.</p>
<p><strong>Total loss</strong> : <del datetime="2012-12-24T21:58:35+00:00">10k</del> 2k<sup><a href="#footnote_22_44660" id="identifier_22_44660" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Even if the original plan was to sell one million shares for one BTC each, it'd seem even 1% is too high an estimate of the sharecount actually sold.">xxiii</a></sup> BTC (estimate).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>6 October 2012</strong> GLBSE is abrubptly closed, apparently by James McCarthy acting against the orders of shareholders. About three dozen assets worth in total maybe 30k BTC find themselves suspended in limbo. Another ~5k of user funds is thus frozen. Later McCarthy issues most of the customer funds and partial lists of beneficial owners for most assets, in such a way that the data can't actually be trusted or used safely (plaintext over email). </p>
<p><strong>Total loss</strong> : 10k BTC (estimated).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>14 October 2012</strong> Clipse<sup><a href="#footnote_23_44660" id="identifier_23_44660" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Mining pool">xxiv</a></sup> defaulted on its promises to miners (seems to be BST related).</p>

<p><strong>2 November 2012</strong> : Consequent of his default to the MPCD series<sup><a href="#footnote_24_44660" id="identifier_24_44660" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="500 BTC principal, for the curious">xxv</a></sup>, <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=121915.0">my PR asks for and a couple weeks later receives</a> a scammer tag in the forum for Patrick Harnett, who had been operating a purported ratings agency, was one of the backers of GLBSe listings of Bitcoin Savings and Trust toxic paper and ran yet another Bitcoin "bank".</p>
<p><strong>Total loss</strong> : 25k BTC (estimated)</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>8 December 2012</strong> Bitcoin Magazine, a scam in itself (having produced a total of 4 issues in about two years, many of which of appalingly poor quality and content) originally announces selling itself to a consortium of Bitcoin corps including BFL (see above) and 20 Mission (the Kenna-Owens partership mentioned above). One shareholder and ex manager (Vladimir Marchenko) claims the current manager (<a href="http://trilema.com/2012/ciuciu-bond/#comment-87615">Mihai Alisie</a>) stole the company. Mihai Alisie responds by claiming Vladimir Marchenko stole from the company, and also failed to steal ~65k USD from a third party which could have been stolen in his estimation. </p>
<p><strong>Total loss</strong> : 3k BTC (estimated)</p>
<hr />
<p>And that pretty much brings us up to date! Quite the ride, isn't it. </p>
<p>For the actuarially inclined, the total losses to theft, fraud and stupidity plus anything in between amount to 1.296 million BTC. That comes to about 75k BTC monthly average for the ~18 months we've discussed. </p>
<p>Considering an average monetary mass of 7mn BTC for the interval, the aggregate of theft, fraud and stupidity registers as about 18%. Considering fiat monetary mass is somewhere on the order of magnitude of 5 trillion USD, proportionally the same levels of loss would come to about 900 billion total or roughly 50 billion a month. Shockingly enough, this figure is not quite that far off the mark (provided we discount government actions from the "stupidity" label).</p>
<p>Finally, here's a nice little monthly graph :</p>
<p><a href="http://trilema.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/btc-scams-graph.png"><img src="http://trilema.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/btc-scams-graph.png" alt="btc-scams-graph" title="btc-scams-graph" width="560" height="439" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44691" /></a></p>
<p>Should we be expecting something like 1 mn BTC default in about a couple of months ? </p>

						<p>My good name requires that I defend it, no matter where it is smeared.</p>
<p>I was the IPO manager of the BDT bonds (which is quite distinct from creating a service or issuing an asset). You can read up how it started at <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=93445.msg1032119#msg1032119">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=93445.msg1032119#msg1032119</a> (complete with disclaimers about my fairly limited involvement); a "post mortem" I wrote when things went awry at <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=93445.msg1204361;topicseen#msg1204361">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=93445.msg1204361;topicseen#msg1204361</a>; and the latest attempts to resolve the situation at the end of that thread.</p>
<p>I may or may not be an idiot, but I am definitely not a scammer and will not tolerate being accused as such.</p>

						<p>For my curiosity, what do you mean by this "IPO manager" term ? In most implementations an actual IPO Lead certifies that all the disclosures made are true, correct, adequate and compliant (and is liable if it is found out that they weren't true, correct, adequate or compliant). </p>
<p>The best possible construction for your case would be that you were in fact nothing but a busy-body, injecting yourself in matters you really had nothing to do with (as you in general do, as far as I know this is practically the only thing you've ever done). That construction would make you a pure idiot.</p>
<p>The worst possible construction for your case would be that you masterminded the entire thing. That would make you a pure scammer. </p>
<p>Your position in that list reflects my judgement on these otherwise imponderable matters. But as far as your good name goes, there is no cause for much alarm : you don't have a good name.</p>

						<p>You can read up on what my role was in the relevant thread.</p>
<p>It was fairly clear what of my report was by my own knowledge - which was all true - and what was based on information from the issuer, the truth value of which I have never had firsthand knowledge of (and for that reason explicitly did not guarantee it, regardless of what would be done by an analogous role in traditional ecosystems).</p>
<p>You drive a hard bargain; I most certainly did not mastermind anything, and I agree that I should not have gotten involved in this, so I'll take you up on your "pure idiot" offer. Have a nice day.</p>

						<p>Great reporting/commenting, as always.  I remembered the TradeHill amount being less, when it went down.  You say 200k BTC... and I thought it was more like 100k USD.  Big difference, obviously.  You may be correct.  Found this quotation:<br />

						<p>@<b>Drake Ness</b> You may also be correct. The difference is that the 100k figure is what Kenna declared as having been lost to Dwolla (which may or may not be true) and the total loss figure is intended to represent the total users lost (which, based on their volume at the time etc could even be larger). But I've added a further note to clarify this point just to be on the safe side.</p>

<p>I'm so sorry for anyone he's hurt--I wish I could do something about it, but I wouldn't even know where to begin. I don't think he's actually a bad guy, just naive, I hope.</p>
