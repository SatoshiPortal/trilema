		<description>Let's see here.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While absolutely &lt;em&gt;nobody&lt;/em&gt; gives shit one about twitter, besides you (because you're entertaining this &lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2013/fried-chicken/"&gt;delusional worldview&lt;/a&gt; wherein you're hoping to turn around and sell it) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;and&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those "&lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2015/the-bitlove-llc-spin-on-their-recent-implosion-as-presented-to-their-captive-audience/#comment-164418"&gt;3 million&lt;/a&gt;" "&lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2015/okcupidcom-the-dating-site/?b=130k&#038;e=210k#select"&gt;subscribers&lt;/a&gt;" ain't &lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2021/the-current-instagram-algorithm-or-monkeys-and-microscopes-again/"&gt;ever gonna see your dumb shit&lt;/a&gt;, ever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;nevertheless&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trilema already enjoys readership in excess of 3 million readers a day. Each and every fucking day, and more on Sundays. Think of it like the circulation of the new york times, five times over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;but even if it didn't&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I still wouldn't entertain this nonsense, because on one hand I'm much too rich to buy twenty-dollar anythings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;and also&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fuck &lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2021/covid-is-not-a-hoax-and-assorted-new-bureaucrat-mythology-misinformation-mendacious-if-self-serving-bullshit/#identifier_2_100987"&gt;you&lt;/a&gt;, and your dumbass "&lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2019/no-platforms/"&gt;platforms&lt;/a&gt;". There's a god damned banner on the right to the same location, 0-reading comprehension twitter-typical moron. Da fuck do I want to say to your sad ilk, you don't grok anything anyways. Go back to twitter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Se-ntelege si acolo-n fund ?</description>

		<description>Hi there,

I came across your site trilema.com and was wondering if you'd be interested in us promoting your site or a page on your site, over Twitter? 

We have a current Twitter audience of over 3 million people, and only charge $20 per promotion.

A couple of the main benefits:

- We can tweet directly to your website, article, blog post etc, meaning you receive extra traffic
- If you're on Twitter, we can retweet you, meaning you gain real, human, interested followers - these people only follow if they are interested, so they aren't just random followers, they are qualified followers

If this is something you feel you might be interested in, just reply to this message and we can discuss further. If not, don't reply, just throw this in the bin :-)

Kind Regards,
Claudia</description>

		<description>Hi Mircea – Long time reader, first comment.

I am a long-time Bitcoin journalist, as you might recall. For much of my career, I didn't add much value and struggled to understand the subject. 

Recently, I think I've done a bit better by resolving to write about the history of Bitcoin and to spend time considering, respecting and reconstructing different time periods for others.

I've so far done an examination of Satoshi's management of the software (https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/what-happened-when-bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-disappeared) and the first soft fork of the protocol in Satoshi's absence (https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/the-battle-for-p2sh-the-untold-story-of-the-first-bitcoin-war). 

These were well-received and generally are thought to be well researched.

Anyway, I believe you contributed quite significantly and uniquely to Bitcoin's philosophy and technology, and it's a story I'd like to tell at some point. 

If that's something that interests you (I don't expect it to), here's my contact information where we can discuss. I'm happy to explain my position more if of interest.</description>
