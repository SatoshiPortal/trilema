<p>Consequently, I give you the first attempt at a republican such and so forth foregoing<sup><a href="#footnote_1_39332" id="identifier_1_39332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="A glossary is a sorted list of items related to a particular item. Like said item's L1, see ?
A thesaurus is a list of synonymy rings. 
In the dark ages before the explicit emergence of the Republic, the `scholars` suibus generis active in those times naturally stumbled on a primitive concept of the WoT, but failing to understand its tree nature instead conceptualized it as a succession of equivalence rings. Language to these early thinkers was then not the structured Republic of words that it in fact is ; but rather appeared to them like an Empire formed of equalitarian gangs distinguished from each other. 
If this view reeks of naive socialism, do not suspect the troglodytes living in past ages of anything but stupidity. The two are both entirely the same one thing after all. Moreover, consider : on occasion they'd warn doctly that `no perfect synonymy exists` ; but then would proceed to act as if it existed nevertheless. Does that bring to mind the `computer experts` of today ? Guess what, someone's someday going to write this same footnote about them, too. Stupid never changes, after all.
PS. That the `Oxford English dictionary` deems it so `long established` a `word` in English that it needn't be italicized in ordinary use is funny, considering sui is the singular dative of sus, and the plural (ie, `their` kind), which could be either subus or suibus, (and without getting into a lengthy discussion let's just say I prefer writing it with an i to distinguish it from the ablative plural) is not found anywhere on the English speaking internets. There's no suibus generis, there's no subus generis, there's just piles upon piles of useless fucktards who imagine they `know some Latin` on the grounds of parroting the `sui generis` they heard, with nary a clue there even was such a thing as Latin which even had such a thing as declension. 
I bother to point this out because we find here Americana entire, truthfully reflected in this tiny raindrop. This is exactly and completely what `the premiere country in the world` is all about : some bits and pieces of stolen hardware randomly placed here and there ; otherwise mucus, sputum and unidentifiable biomass qs.
PPS. Apparently doctly (in the ways and manners of being doct) is entirely incomprehensible to native speakers ; and further apparently there's no such thing as doct (displaying the characteristics of common belief or popular understanding) in English either, because fuck it all, half the classical roots are `of course everyone knows, o yeah, totally` whereas the other half is complete dumbfounded incomprehension and wtf is this doxa, dokein thing.

The jew (ie, "private sector" aspie) and the nigger (ie, the "public service" aspie) are the main subspecies commonly seen in the zone, though rather indistinct and readily substituting for one another. The difference between aspie and libertard is of the same kind as the difference between engineer and scientist : one's the attempt to apply the other in some kind of practice.</li>

May be terrorist in nature. Meanwhile <a href=http://trilema.com/2020/closure/>defunct</a>.</li>
<p>
<li><strong>careerwoman</strong> (2019), not particularly intelligent (and remarkably <a href=http://trilema.com/2015/recursive-dunning-kruger/>tunaware</a>) female, belabouring under the misapprehension that her USG-provided "employment" is genuine activity, as opposed to sheer makework of no point or consequence. Most slavegirls are born the day a careerwoman suffers what acoholics refer to as "a moment of clarity".</li>
<p>
<li><strong>Clucker</strong> what you probably refer to as a "smartphone", as per pantsuit tradition of calling everything its exact opposite. <a href=http://trilema.com/2020/now-you-tell-me-wheres-this-from/#comment-147546>There's nothing smart about them</a>, yo! They just dumb you down. </li>

<li><strong>Cuck</strong>, current contraction of older cuckold, is a male that deems what women have to say <em>intrinsically</em> important<sup><a href="#footnote_5_39332" id="identifier_5_39332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The older version deemed what just one woman had to say intrinsically important (hence ye olde cheating wife argument, `are you going to believe your own eyes or what I tell you?!`). With the `general alienation of postmodernism` (aka Inca flattening pressure), however, the term migrated to more closely reflect the vague, impersonal sort of relations now common.">vi</a></sup>. The term for a male that wants the women he owns fucked by others is <strong>pimp</strong>, and yes it's a kink<sup><a href="#footnote_6_39332" id="identifier_6_39332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="While the term for a male that owns no women is absolutely boy, exactly and for very good cause identical with the term for sexually immature male (even though in some contexts boi is useful in marking the distinction).">vii</a></sup>, entirely unrelated to economic exchange<sup><a href="#footnote_7_39332" id="identifier_7_39332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Whether the pimp charges you upfront or not, you still owe him, exactly in the same manner and exactly for the same reasons you owe after you ate in all those eateries where you don't pay before eating ; and even if the restaurant owner gifts you the meal you still owe him.

Idle, unintelligent female maintained by a powerless male.

<p>
<li><strong>ESL</strong>. English as a Single Language. Derrogatory term denoting the mentally simple inhabitants of the United States as well as feebleminded derps everywhere. ESL is an absolute bar to citizenship or civil rights.</li>

The cultural counterpart to the Great Inca.</li>
<p>
<li><strong>-fu</strong>. Always as a suffix, calc from kung-fu. Pie-fu is then ambiguously either pie making or pie eating of a competency superlative to the degree of elevating the whole thing to at the very least the level of a spectator sport, if not outright art.</li>
<p>
<li><strong>Great Inca</strong> (cca 2016). A reference to the perfect socialism archeologic record seems to suggest prevailed in the medieval Inca empire, the Great Inca is a derrisive reference to totemized contemporary socialism. The civilisational counterpart to the femstate.</li>
<p>
<li><strong>Jew</strong>. Anyone involved in the mediatization of socialism, from <a href="http://trilema.com/2016/tropic-thunder/">Ben Stiller</a> down. They happen to also mostly be jews in the obsolete meaning of the term, more or less coincidentally.</li>

For the record, the position is not merely infantile and untenable, but actually quite reductive. This is to say that notwithstanding such a thing could never exist, if it were to exist the world would be poorer and sadder for its existence, not richer nor happier. There obviously exist those who equate `civilisation` with this sort of castration ; but they are a very sad lot indeed.">x</a></sup>, a jwz is the noxious piece of biofurniture that "just wants to"<sup><a href="#footnote_10_39332" id="identifier_10_39332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="As alf correctly observes, `the whole point of engineering is to cut apart the happenstance-linked crud from what you actually want`. Nevertheless, this is the point of engineering, a narrow activity dealing with like things. It is not a universally applicable process, and any attempt to apply Alexander's solution to Hamlet's quandry necessarily produces monsters. You may not be interested in war, but war is interested in you ; you may not wish the political implication of your acts and activities, but there they are wished for or not ; you may not want violence as part of your life, but violence is part of life and you - aren't.

<li><strong>Mayogendered</strong> (2015). The Republic had long observed that the neutral gender  (which is to say neither <a href="http://trilema.com/2014/patriarchy-is-a-thing-because-nobody-likes-living-in-a-world-populated-by-little-girls/">male</a> nor <a href="http://trilema.com/2016/portrait-of-an-adult-woman/">female</a>), seen in numerous grammars as well as most beasts of burden, truly applies to a significant fraction of the population of the <em>soi-dissant</em> "civilised" world. Bingoboingo <a href="http://trilema.com/2019/forum-logs-for-01-oct-2015#1888631">had the genius</a> to make the connection with obesity. It is a fact that the harmonious, healthy development of the human being into sexuate maturity is hindered by <em>burden</em>, be it the burden of lard, or of stupidity, or of a toxic environment or whatever else. The beasts of burden are castrated <em>by their burden</em>, just like the unfortunate non-men non-women of the "progressive" cause are castrated by their stupidty, or the landed manatees by their blubber. To mark the fact that this refuse<sup><a href="#footnote_11_39332" id="identifier_11_39332" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="There can be obviously no discussion of human rights for the mayogendered : they're not human.">xii</a></sup> can not structurally participate in human society, they get their own gender.</li>

<li><strong>Mula</strong> (<a href=http://trilema.com/2011/oricine-poate-sa/>2011</a>) denotes the average female with average preoccupations and medium beliefs animated by <a href=http://trilema.com/2018/the-retards-handshake/>median notions of decency</a> -- in brief, the herding ewe. The one that dresses "like the girls", thinks "<a href=http://trilema.com/2013/soft-consensus-aka-fecal-matter/>consensus</a>" thoughts, drives <a href=http://trilema.com/2015/very-bad-things/?b=I%20am%20a%20creature&#038;e=other#select>to be married</a> because that's what Mommy wants and expects on one hand to be happy by virtue of inertia and on the other that everyone should behave in exactly like manner because that is <b>GOOD</b>.</li>

asciilifeform 'The Restatement (Second) of Torts § 559 lists “membership in the Ku Klux Klan” as the quintessential illustration of a defamatory statement. In an opinion piece in The Detroit News, columnist Bankole Thompson asserted that radio show host James Edwards is a “leader” of the Ku Klux Klan. There is no record evidence to suggest that Edwards holds a formal leadership position in the Ku Klux Klan, nor is there any record evidence

mircea_popescu that's some pretty great legal reasoning right there. `the factual accuracy of statements can now be derived from the company one keeps -- for instance, a man can not be sued for practicing medicine without a license for as long as he does it within sight of actual doctors` where the fuck do they find these mental molluscs ? i wonder what laws of magic will be invoked to pretend that tort `ruling` is not precedent for de-licensing medicine.
asciilifeform the reality of present-day usg is that precedent is precedent when they feel like it, and unprecedent when they unfeellikeit. the 1 law, where 'precedent is whatever we say it is'. sorta like 'in this germany, a jew is he who i say is a jew' in the earlier reich.

You never heard it before, I wager ?">xxii</a></sup> for your hard work and sagacity, here's an extra section dedicated to stripping away mistaken ideas about words you think you already know (but really don't) : </p>
<ul>
<li>You know what <strong>altruism</strong> is, right ? Because it's such a common term, with a lengthy history and just as much a word as all the other words, having been known to humanity since forever on the basis of its centrality in <em>your</em> idiocy.
<p style="padding-left: 70px;">In fact, altruism is an <em>obscure</em>, recent Italian coinage. It's derived off the Italian word for "not minding one's own business" (<em>altrui</em>) with the universal suffix for "<a href="http://trilema.com/2013/racists-and-socialists/">stupidity</a>" (-ism).</p>
</li>
<li>You also know what <strong>charisma</strong> is, right ? Because it's such a common term, with a lengthy history and just as much a word as all the other words, having been known to humanity since forever on the basis of its centrality in <em>your</em> idiocy.
<p style="padding-left: 70px;">In fact, charisma is an <em>obscure</em> ancient term, used principally by Paul to discuss with the early xtians the specific characteristic that marked one as chosen by God for leadership. Max Weber picked it up last century to illustrate some bullshit reductionist theory he was cooking up at the time. It caught on, because you're <a href="http://trilema.com/2013/the-disadvantage-of-teaching-people-the-alphabet-and-nothing-more-is-that-you-have-to-somehow-put-up-with-a-bunch-of-retards-that-can-now-express-themselves-in-writing/">lazy idiots</a> and the only thing that ever catches on is reductionist <a href="http://trilema.com/2018/heres-what-changed/#comment-125163">bullshit</a>. Exactly opposite to how it goes for <a href=" http://trilema.com/2017/is-it-still-rape-if-i-write-science-on-my-penis-first/#selection-97.0-119.187">actual minds</a>, your only driver of interest is "thought savings" : you'll read that which promises to "save you" from "having to" read longer or more complex pieces and nothing else!</p>
</li>
<li>You also know what <strong>empathy</strong> is, right ? Because it's such a common term, with a lengthy history and just as much a word as all the other words, having been known to humanity since forever on the basis of its centrality in <em>your</em> idiocy.
<p style="padding-left: 70px;">In fact, empathy is a <a href="http://trilema.com/2020/forum-logs-for-26-may-2018/#2443734">new age</a> coinage, which is to say merely a few decades old, and a fine example of UStardian barbarism as ever could be had : mixing together Greek and German because "whatever, the nation of Africa". Laugh if you will -- but this is still how they "think". </p>
<p style="padding-left: 70px;">Its role is transparently to "steal the having been stolen from" with regards to human interaction : as the starfish pattern the Inca depends upon takes hold of human society, individual people become incapable of mutual understanding or communication -- but that's ok, inside the insanity, because Inca will provide them with "empathy", which won't work except in one singular sense -- to make them think they're not missing the thing Inca stole from them, or in other words, to allow the great Inca to steal <em>even the having been stolen from</em>. Retch if you will, that's still how they "think".</p>
</li>
<li>You also know what <strong>racism</strong> is, right ? Because it's such a common term, with a lengthy history and just as much a word as all the other words, having been known to humanity since forever on the basis of its centrality in <em>your</em> idiocy.
<p style="padding-left: 70px;">In fact, racism is <a href="http://trilema.com/2013/racists-and-socialists/">an entirely meaningless symbol</a> used as a sort of flag by the losing side in all political struggles : the idiots.</p>
</li>
<li>You also know what <strong>rape</strong> is, right ? Because it's such a common term, with a lengthy history and just as much a word as all the other words, having been known to humanity since forever on the basis of its centrality in <em>your</em> idiocy.
<p style="padding-left: 70px;">Indeed you are correct : rape means harvest. Conceptually the difference between land as an environment factor and woman as an environment factor was never clear to the agrarian mind, a confusion that powered most of classical art and all of ancient as well as modern society. Remember now : sooner or later they come for you. Better have something to show for it when they do!</p>

<p>A thesaurus is a list of synonymy rings. </p>
<p>In the dark ages before the explicit emergence of the Republic, the "scholars" <em>suibus generis</em> active in those times naturally stumbled on a primitive concept of the WoT, but failing to understand its tree nature instead conceptualized it as a succession of equivalence rings. Language to these early thinkers was then not the structured <a href="http://trilema.com/2020/forum-logs-for-21-dec-2016/#2213215">Republic of words</a> that it in fact is ; but rather appeared to them like an Empire formed of equalitarian gangs distinguished from each other. </p>
<p>If this view reeks of naive socialism, do not suspect the troglodytes living in past ages of anything but stupidity. The two are both entirely the same one thing after all. Moreover, consider : on occasion they'd warn doctly that "no perfect synonymy exists" ; but then would proceed to act as if it existed <em>nevertheless</em>. Does that bring to mind the "computer experts" of today ? Guess what, someone's someday going to write this same footnote about them, too. Stupid never changes, after all.</p>
<p>PS. That the "Oxford English dictionary" deems it so "long established" a "word" in English that it needn't be italicized in ordinary use is funny, considering sui is the <em>singular</em> dative of sus, and the plural (ie, "their" kind), which could be either subus or suibus, (and without getting into a lengthy discussion let's just say I prefer writing it with an i to distinguish it from the ablative plural) is not found anywhere on the English speaking internets. There's no <em>suibus generis</em>, there's no <em>subus generis</em>, there's just piles upon piles of useless fucktards who imagine they "<a href="http://trilema.com/2013/i-dont-no-biari-i-know-a-littel-java/">know some Latin</a>" on the grounds of parroting the "sui generis" they heard, with nary a clue there even was such a thing as Latin which even had such a thing as declension. </p>
<p>I bother to point this out because we find here Americana entire, truthfully reflected in this tiny raindrop. This is exactly and completely what "<a href="http://trilema.com/2016/to-the-dao-and-the-ethereum-community-fuck-you/#comment-117601">the premiere country in the world</a>" is all about : some bits and pieces of stolen hardware randomly placed here and there ; otherwise mucus, sputum and unidentifiable biomass qs.</p>
<p>PPS. Apparently doctly (in the ways and manners of being doct) is entirely incomprehensible to native speakers ; and further apparently there's no such thing as doct (displaying the characteristics of common belief or popular understanding) in English either, because fuck it all, half the classical roots are "of course everyone knows, o yeah, totally" whereas the other half is complete dumbfounded incomprehension and wtf is this doxa, dokein thing.

In an opinion piece in The Detroit News, columnist Bankole Thompson asserted that radio show host James Edwards is a “leader” of the Ku Klux Klan. There is no record evidence to suggest that Edwards holds a formal leadership position in the Ku Klux Klan, nor is there any record evidence<br />

Mindful of Aesop's lesson, “A man is known by the company he keeps,” 1 we hold that Edwards cannot make claims of defamation or invasion of privacy and affirm summary disposition in favor of defe<br />

<p><b>asciilifeform</b> the reality of present-day usg is that precedent is precedent when they feel like it, and unprecedent when they unfeellikeit. the 1 law, where 'precedent is whatever we say it is'. sorta like 'in this germany, a jew is he who i say is a jew' in the earlier reich.</p></blockquote>
