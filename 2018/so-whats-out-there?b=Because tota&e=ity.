I am a swinger and in that lifestyle and be default my world crosses with BDSM. I am on Fetlife as I thought it might be some hidden nugget. In all honestly the BDSM is just like regular life but for weirdo and freaks. You still get the ego and bitch shields but from 3's 4's and 5's.</p>
<p>And unless you have to put in a lot of legwork to gain some traction. Since the scene is small in whatever City your in large or small there are parties and social things you have to go to be be seen. Its literally just a Facebook for World of Warcraft players, fat people, or nymphos. They whore and troll on it just like FB.

Hello GregSY<br />
I'm not sure if you can impregnate wood with polyurethane or not, but you sure can with oil. I used to use some oak for saw blade guides on my sawmill &#038; they would wear out in a few days. An old time sawyer told me to have them soaking in a can of oil when they were not in use. It made a world of difference. I sawed thousands of feet of lumber &#038; never had to adjust them as there was zero wear after that oak was impregnated with oil</p>

WVU had a research project going on in the early '60's casually referred to as 'Atomic Wood'. They had to use a vacuum chamber to get the resins they were testing INTO the wood samples. Irradiation in a nuke reactor followed, hardening the infused plastics. Goal was improved strength, rot-resistance, dimensional stability, etc. And cheap scalability.</span> Which last part failed.</p>
<p>Closest commercial product seen, at least in concept, were the trim strips on BMW and Mercedes 'genuine walnut' interiors. AFAIK done with heat and pressure, 'maybe' UV light, but not radiation.</p>
<p>May have lasted longer with less care than the 'natural' ones used on British luxury cars, but looked like plastic the whole time, and not even as 'natural' looking as GOOD plastic, so no real gain.</p>
<p>Otherwise, when as-growed, dried, and reasonably cheaply post-treated wood won't do, one simply uses a better wood (lignum vitae and cousins) ..... or some other material entirely.</p>
<p>The economics just aren't right for fighting Mother Nature much further than that.</p>
<p>One half-solvent thin coat, one quarter-solvent thin coat, one full-strength coat of urethane is all I am willing to put into such projects. It works well - really well - on particle board/OSB, but only marginally better than two ordinary coats on 'real' wood.</p></blockquote>

<p>Abstract<br />
The reduction in hygroscopicity as spruce wood is impregnated with linseed oil may be accounted for using a molecular exclusion model. On the basis of the model, each linseed oil molecule appears to displace 90 water molecules and occupy 6 hydrogen bonding sites in the wood. </p>

The fact that [it] isn't very funny and, like its 80-year-old heroic, long outlives its necessary life, is less important than the fact that the characters frequently react gently or like credible human beings to the script's impossible notions.<br />

    Picking and eating crabs is an earthy, down-home way to enjoy these tasty crustaceans — but crabs don't give up their treasures lightly. Picking crab meat takes time, but it's pretty easy when you know some tricks and tips.</p>

<p>Hermit crabs make adorable pets but these little packages of cuteness are surprisingly high-maintenance and require very exacting care.</p>
<p>Hermit crabs are widely believed to be easy to care for, and ideal first pets for children. Neither of these beliefs is true. Unfortunately, hermit crabs are very difficult to keep healthy, and they should be kept in groups. Not only are hermit crabs are not hermit-like at all, they are gregarious partiers who will keep a crab-party going all night.</p>
<p>You’ve probably seen the clear plastic critter-carriers and one-gallon fish tanks where hermit crabs are sometimes displayed. These are not safe homes for hermit crabs. In fact, if the critter-carrier has a standard “berry-basket” top for ventilation, the crab inside is probably already dying a slow and painful death. Hermit crabs breathe air through modified gills. They will drown in water, and they have no lungs. If the gills ever dry out, the animal is in serious trouble. The resulting death by suffocation can take months, but it is inevitable. Therefore, maintaining sufficient humidity in the hermit crab enclosure is very, very important.</p></blockquote>

<p>Communication ProtocolsIn the networking world, we see the word "protocols" quite often.  Just what is a protocol?  The dictionary will define a protocol as a set of  rules or a process or procedure of how to proceed or act.  Communication protocols in the network are the rules that are followed when transmitting and receiving or exchanging information. Back when I was studying for the CCNA, two protocols came to mind when we exchange data over a network.  Yes, you know them well. They are Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP). TCP has certain attributes.  It is connection oriented, has greater overhead, is slower than UDP, has acknowledgements and is reliable in helping to make sure our message arrives.  It has a larger header and contains flow control mechanisms.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>In some works democracy is bad. It is generally presented as an ineffectual form of government highly prone to corruption, demagoguery and takeovers by radicals and, in some portrayals, as a form of mob rule which tramples on individual rights to appeal to public sentiment.<br />
It can also be presented this way by authors who don't necessarily approve of other forms of government, but are cynical enough that they consider all forms of government to be flawed (with the inclusion of no government at all). As Winston Churchill put it "Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the other methods that have been tried".note<br />
For most of history, say, before the Dutch Republic, the term "Democracy" was more-or-less synonymous with "Anarchy" or "Mob Rule," believed by many to be a utopian idea that could never work in practice and would lead to the collapse of society. The term is rarely used this way today because the forms and ideas of democracy shifted radically from Athens to the Middle Ages.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Notes for a Discussion of Ricoeur's Symbolism of Evil<br />
    Uploaded by    Sean Hannan</p>
<p>2<br />
Contingency of Historical Symbols: At the end of his introduction (p. 19-24), Ricoeur<br />
acknowledges that there‟s a fundamental contingency in his project. That contingency<br />
comes out of the fact that he has to start from within a certain historical tradition of symbolism. His happens t<br />
o be „Western,‟ which he takes to be a kind of encounter between<br />
philosophy as it was practiced by the Greeks and ancient Jewish culture. He is not saying that all humans from every possible background must be held up to some standard of  Western symbolism. Instead, he is trying to get from a historically situated position<br />
 —<br />
the<br />
symbolism of evil in „Western‟ texts—<br />
to a broader understanding of the experiences those texts can evoke. It may seem awkward that he puts historical contingency side by side with a description of human experience, but his procedure here is related to how he sees<br />
phenomenology and hermeneutics intersecting (see above). Phenomenology‟s<br />
openness to meaning also<br />
opened it up to history, culture, contingency. The „bare evidence‟ of lived experience was then made slightly less bare, since it comes to us<br />
dressed in historically and culturally influenced clothing. If we want to get at meaningful experience, then, we have to start with specific historical traditions and then try to go through them to reach out at something more broad-ranging. In other  words, we have to start with<br />
symbols<br />
 and go through<br />
myths<br />
 before we get at abstract or universalizing<br />
speculation<br />
.  The Symbols<br />
Ricoeur starts to get at the „substance‟ of his argument in the next three chapters, each of<br />
 which deals with a way of symbolizing fault. What he gives us is a<br />
typology<br />
 of symbols. The point is to run through these three<br />
types<br />
 of symbols and trace out the picture of evil they<br />
paint for us. On the one hand, Ricoeur‟s approach is<br />
historical<br />
and<br />
 hermeneutical<br />
: it makes use of particular examples from textual traditions (e.g., the prophets, the Pharisees, Greek tragedy). On the other hand, his main criterion for judgment is<br />
 phenomenological<br />
: he is trying to demarcate different types of experience, not just different historical representations. He is, in some way, trying to use historical representations to get at distinct modes of possible experience.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>An Examination of Conflict Style Preferences in India<br />

<p>Abstract<br />
Purpose – This study sets out to examine conflict style preferences in India and the predictive effects of various demographic variables on conflict style preference. Design/methodology/approach – Data were gathered in India (n=827) among Muslims and Hindus. Conflict was measured using Oetzel's Conflict Style Measure. To answer the research questions, repeated measures ANOVA and multiple regressions were conducted. Findings – The findings reveal that conflict style preference among Hindus in India differs significantly and that Hindus prefer the integrating and dominating styles, whilst showing the least inclination towards the avoiding and obliging styles. Muslims prefer the integrating and compromising styles and least prefer the dominating and avoiding styles. Analyses of the demographic variables' predictive influence reveal that age and sex are significant predictors for all five conflict styles for both Muslims and Hindus. Education has a mixed predictive influence on conflict style among Hindus and Muslims. Research limitations/implications – Use of self-report instruments and the majority of the participants coming from middle-class backgrounds could limit the generalizability of the study. Practical implications – The study calls for conflict mediators to consider the influence of group membership and educational level on conflict management/resolution. The research also discusses national/international conflict intervention. Social implications – This paper informs individuals regarding the way in which two large religious and cultural groups differ in their approaches to conflict. For a nation that has experienced a history of conflict between these two cultural/religious groups, this paper can help shed light on how to bridge the conflict between them. Originality/value – There are no studies directly comparing the conflict styles of Muslims and Hindus. </p>

<blockquote><p>Matriarchy vs. Patriarchy<br />
AKBear  Saturday April 11, 2015 · 6:37 PM CST</p>
<p>In the last few weeks, I've had several discussions with people about matriarchy and patriarchy in social structures, matrilineal and patrilineal ways of viewing the world.  And, what I've found out is rather amazing.</p>
<p>A lot of people think that matriarchy is the exact opposite in structure as patriarchy.  Patriarchy is what most people see these days in dominant, mainstream societies -- being governed by men, having judiciaries dominated by men, children taking the man's last name, the old idea in the modern practice of coverture in Christian, straight marriage, the veneration of old white guys throughout history and the nearly-complete disregard to women's contribution to that history, etc, etc, etc.</p>
<p>Matriarchy, following this logic, would be the complete subjugation of men to women and follow the strict hierarchical structure inherent in patriarchy.  I can see why matriarchy is such a scary idea to those deeply invested in patriarchy . . . and, I'm here to offer some reassurance by offering what matriarchy looked like in pre-contact Americas.</p>
<p>Matriarchy was a term used to label any society that did not follow the European idea of hierarchical patriarchy.  It was applied to every society that did not conform to what Europeans thought of as being "civilized," (which was anything but civilized, imho), </p></blockquote>

<p>William Kay has contributed previously in the Gulag. He is a student of the Old European-side roots of the ecofascist movement, which has, collaborating with their Marxist cousins, given us the Agenda 21 strategy for the destruction of popular and national sovereignty and with it, Western Civilization – all in the name of environmentalism.</p>
<p>One should note that Kay tends to refer to Old Europe’s right-left paradigm, perhaps best defined in the French Revolution and onward, of aristocrats on the right and Jacobins/Marxists on the left, each competing for their own brands of authoritarianism. That is distinct from our American view, of the authoritarian Marxists on the left and devotees of the republican social contract of sovereign Citizens on the right. The Old European right-left paradigm is much like the Marxian view, except the Marxists have no regard for the Natural Law responsibilities of free moral agents accountable to God, and thus they bundle us patriots in with the those of the aristocrats they cannot swing their way, into the bourgeoisie, as they may prefer to say.</p></blockquote>

During the past few years, there has been a growing awareness of how unpaid debts get bought and sold. The fact that debts can be purchased for steep discounts by investors and collection companies — who then work to collect the full balances owed — has lead to some meaningful discussions, and increased scrutiny of debt buying, and debt collection practices in general. So much so that California recently passed new laws governing how debt buyers go about collecting.</p></blockquote>

<p>Debt collectors get most of their revenue from people who fall hopelessly behind on student loans, medical bills, auto loans, credit cards and home mortgages. Some forms of debt – student loans and medical debt especially – are shooting up so fast that many consumers aren’t even aware they are behind until they receive a call from a collection agency.</p>
<p>Collection agencies often are intimidating, demanding and most of all persistent, in trying to extract whatever money you have available to satisfy your debt.

How Can I Pay My Delinquent Wells Fargo Car Loan When They Won’t Reply?<br />
By Steve Rhode on October 27, 2016</p>
<p>Question:</p>
<p>Dear Steve,</p>
<p>I have a 2008 Chevy Malibu that I defaulted on the loan to Wells Fargo in 2015 when my work fell way off. I tried to negotiate reinstatement but they ignored both my calls and letters. I even had an attorney write them and got no response. I have kept the car in my garage and have not driven it since March 2016 due to my fear of it being repossessed while I was out. I got a small inheritance and now just want to pay off the car so it will not be repossessed. But Wells Fargo will not reply.</p>
<p>How do I negotiate an agreement with the bank to pay off the car? I am sure the fees are adding up. I think I owe about $12,000 in the contract but am not sure. It seems to me that it would be a win-win for both of us and it would save us both time and money. Thank you</p></blockquote>

Court held: Absent a transcript, after reviewing "the Hearings Examiner's report it is apparent that numerous factual findings support the action taken by the Director."</p></blockquote>
