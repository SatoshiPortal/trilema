		<description>Absolutely not. If and when I decide to take over the world in this sense, I will assign some of the worthless sacks of biofilth to die under the whip burying them ; until then, whoever is pretending to the throne has to either do it or be laughed at. This is the only practical way to do anything, as ever was and ever will be : put the bleaters to work, or else get off the pig.</description>

		<description>Of course it's physically possible to bury power lines. The problem is paying for them. If you could assign a wallet address to each little route of lines that needed to be buried, would you give them a few satoshi? Would anyone else? 

I'm actually interested in finding that out in a practical way.
