<p style="padding-left: 250px; text-align: right;"><strong>Motto:</strong> anyway, I think I'm going to reprint (and adnotate) the bolix discussion trinque linked, because I fear it's so concise and the language so tense that in a few more years nobody, including myself, will understand what the fuck was being said.</p>
<p><b>phf</b> mcclim always reminds me of how rms was planning on competing with symbolics by reimplementing everything they had on top of gnu platform.<sup><a href="#footnote_0_79456" id="identifier_0_79456" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This is factually correct, and barely begins to do justice to the personal history of he disaffectionately dubbed `the human mushroom`. As far as my own read of the early history of killer micros stands, Stallman was exactly politruk : an overambitious underachiever who attempted ye olde `crack it two with the hammer to separate the things into something they can stuff in own pockets, and then mount them on their oxcart` wrt emacs, and whose apparent `success` in this colored the entire rest of his career. Ever wondered why `scientists` of the socialist state flavour, much like `politicians` of the same, and much like everything else in that soup specialize ? Ever wonder why the jewelry thief ended up a jewelry thief as opposed to a highway robber or grifter or whatever else `specialization` ? Because yes, it's exactly `the first line in which he had any success at all`.">i</a></sup> that was the goal. only a handful people who actually worked with a genera realize how "special" the result of rms's work was. mcclim's grey athena widget is from-cave attempt at "industry standard" echo of an echo</p>
<p><b><span style="background-color:#d3d3d3" id="select">mircea_popescu</b> why exactly did everyone in the golden lisp era feel such a burning need to compete with each other anyway ? i mean rms, i understand, stray dog mit took in, he'd bark at st peter if st peter came by. but the rest of 'em ?</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> gnu's confinement ( from poverty ) to 'commodity' (i.e. unix) hardware was a forced 'exile from eden' and the derp response is to postulate 'we're JUST AS GOOD, US TOO!1111' etc. the other idiocies follow from 'we can make roman aqueduct in empty field, and with 0 book-larnin', and it will be Just As Good'.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> yes, though i'm not particularily interested in stallman's moth-eaten brain. there were what, 5 different wanna-be symbolix corps ? commercial lisps ? etc. what sense did any engineer imagine this will make ? seems a lot of [the] retarded one-man-ism that gave the world 5k "airplane inventors" and just as many canvas-made planes that didn't work worth a shit.<sup><a href="#footnote_1_79456" id="identifier_1_79456" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="You are aware of the early history of flight, right, back when it was a `the people themselves` affair ?">ii</a></sup></p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> most of the subj of thread is post-rms. iirc there were 3 mit licensees :  symbolics, lmi, and ti. strangely, even though ti was a megacorp already at the time, their offering was the least memorable.</p>
<p><b>BingoBoingo</b> No mystery. They were likely operating from an internal assumption of leadership and thus snore.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> the question of "why the fuck would anyone even bother with a mit '''license'''" we'll leave for some other time.<sup><a href="#footnote_2_79456" id="identifier_2_79456" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="It is not an idle question.

Well... `wrong`.
THEY'RE THE SAME FUCKING THING.">iii</a></sup><br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> describe the hypothetical 'not bothering'. thing was several thou. man-years of gnarly work, it was not repeatable in a garage. (work on multi$million handmade machines, also, not on commodity iron). in fact the piss ui from this thread, clim, franz lisp, whole shebang of barbarian yurts decorated with smashed roman mosaic, were results of later attempt to 'repeat in garage' regardless.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> mit never had a thousand man-years of work, in its entire history to date, counting all the departments.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> ai lab strictly. it was the beginning and immediately the end of the 'interesting' mit.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> right. and if it were an actual man-year of work it'd be a wonder. ie, a dozen people "worked" in the us sense<sup><a href="#footnote_3_79456" id="identifier_3_79456" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="No, 1500 or so hours a year do not make `a year`, and especially not the sorts of hours they do.">iv</a></sup> for 18 months.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> mno.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> blow me away.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> i read the released cadr schematics. and the source. it was genuinely 1000+ man-year of genuine work. ever built wire-wrap anything ? picture ten tonnes of it. and quite reasonably minimal, even.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> this argument will not prevail, because again, mit never paid that many hours.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> most of the hours were worked unpaid, by slaves.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> mit also never had this many useful slaves.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> again it wasn't 'mit', it was 'mit's ai lab', wholly - at the time - unique assemblage. if mircea_popescu already postulated a conclusion in his head, and doesn't actually give half a fuck about facts<sup><a href="#footnote_4_79456" id="identifier_4_79456" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Item lived 1963 to 2003 as `Project MAC`. If we agree he didn't mean `CSAIL` by it, MAC was launched on a $2mn grant of DARPA's, and led by Robert Fano (And it was called a `project` to get that sweet sweet unpaid slave work, yes, were it called a `laboratory` it'd have worked differently ; and yes the whole `thousand eyes` expectations about the internet and human collaboration were based on linear extension of the experience of that early cvasi-internet but rather-republic, and so on).
If you don't count a coupla PDP-6s and a PDP-10 in the costs, and if you gleefully ignore HOW government grants are used (check out Samuel Clemens sometime, he explains it for you) you may come to different conclusions ; but otherwise that grant did in fact pay for just about 18 months' worth of work. These are the facts.">v</a></sup>, i will not bother with this thread. 1970s mit ai lab != modern mit just as 1850s usg ain't today's.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> and the problem of "slaves" and "work" is very interestingly repeating. so : if you count all the receptionists in the "work" you're getting an obviously diluted figure. if this were how work worked, i could build spaceship by hiring 1mn chickens/hair stylists in argentina. evidently, argentina isn't building any spaceships.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> 0 receptionists. </p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> slaves, idem. if you count every nigger at mit, derping about "we're one, man" and "i should have money anyway" then yes you get the figures, but if you count THAT as slavery god help you.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> it was this club where they let the brightest undergrads burn their lives for 0 pay to build interesting hw.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> asciilifeform this item did not physically exist. dozen people eighteen months. thatssit. where's the 500 undergrads ~actually~ working for decades ?<sup><a href="#footnote_5_79456" id="identifier_5_79456" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The substance of this disagreement may not even have been evident to him at the time, but the broad point I am (unstatedly) making is that if he'll countenance linear extrapolations from those early, narrowly confined situations, I'm going to return the favour by doing linear extrapolations from today into the narrowly confined situation. Because might as well, neh ?
In point of fact, the mythical `brightest undergrads burn their lives for 0 pay to build interesting hw` exist the same place `the internet unleashed a new era of intellectual productivity by reducing the barriers to collaboration` bla bla exists : Malleus, and there only.">vi</a></sup></p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> decade. at the ai lab.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> have you seen the premises ? not physically possible to host 100 people working there, let alone 500 wtf.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> most of the heavy lifting was done by a dozen or so people, however. (david moon, richard greenblatt, tom knight, buncha smaller ones )</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> dozenpeopleeighteenmonths!!!</p>
<p><b>phf</b> asciilifeform clim fwiw predates micro exodus. was, like common lisp, an attempt by the three vendors to make a unified gui foundation. you can still see scarring in genera where they started transitioning to clim apps from their flavors.<sup><a href="#footnote_6_79456" id="identifier_6_79456" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I entirely agree with this view. Both clim and cl principally stand as misdirected attempts to construct a foundation of meaning outside of absent authority,... at which juncture, permit me to recount an anecdote. I said once that `I've no further patience for this crap (we were watching a film, maybe), the endless disputes of two subbies arguing to establish who should top for the evening`. One particular slavegirl took the expression to heart, and launched a vast personal research project of reviewing different sources (mostly, online communities, like say reddit's relationship advice open mic column) under this light. She shares tidbits occasionally, but universally it is the same thing over and over again : `jesus christ, that is exactly their problem`, repeated ad nauseam &#038; infinitum qs in varying `flavourings`.
Because it's a thing, what!">vii</a></sup></p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> NOW -- the question is why did this fucktarded dozen decide the best thing to do is make 3-6-howevermany "Competing" entitites.</p>
<p><b>phf</b> actually that's the same (i assume rhetorical) question rms was asking</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> iirc rms really hated noftsker, for some reason</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> mno. his question was "why do these 12 people not see the glory of socialism and dedicate their lives to making every receptionist live in luxury she can't pay for".<sup><a href="#footnote_7_79456" id="identifier_7_79456" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Very much RMS's disagreements with other `insiders` can universally be interpreted as well as unerringly predicted on a strict structure of `they're not sufficiently Trotskyst`.">viii</a></sup> why such rotten bullshit would get a flat no in return is directly obvious.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> ( iirc it was because he went 'let us have our king from among our ~own~ number, why this imported viking lord ' ). this was pre-gnu rms, as far as is known -- apolitical.</p>
<p><b>phf</b> hmm, i always thought his question was a lot more naively childish "why'd did all my friends i had fun with left to do these weird `grownup` things".</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> of course childish. socialism. that's what it is. the notion that there can be an apolitical something is like the notion that there can be a transparent non menstruating woman etc.<sup><a href="#footnote_8_79456" id="identifier_8_79456" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Arabic fantasies.">ix</a></sup></p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> mircea_popescu rms naively believed (but afaik -- genuinely believed) that one can separate the cutlets from the flies. i.e. the experimenters from the receptionists.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> i expect rms did no such thing ; but that he correctly believed that if structured as ~radical~ socialism, socialism may be made to appear palatable to intelligent people<sup><a href="#footnote_9_79456" id="identifier_9_79456" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="For as long as it stays -- and dies! -- small, that is.">x</a></sup> ; at any rate more so than the commodified variant. hence all his imbecillities with "log scale for music payments by downloads" and whatnot other respectable sovietisms.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> i have nfi, but must point out that this time was prior to him having written down any such thing.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> she's still a woman even at a time prior to having foaled.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> and pre- him receiving the socialist prizes etc. pre-gnu. he was just another d00d in those times.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> i don't think there is any such thing [as just a dood]. i also do not think one can become a socialist. they're all born this way. it's braindamage, basically.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> i don't buy this 'was always a trotskyist<sup><a href="#footnote_10_79456" id="identifier_10_79456" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="See, I didn't use the word, albeit it very much is the correct word, as illustrated by the footnotes ; that he followed my trees and selected the correct categories is a standing ovation to both his culture and his intelligence ; but memory being the fragmentary device that it is, I fear this feat may have been eaten by moths over time ; so we get this article instead.">xi</a></sup>, from baby' thing. not everyone is born in his particular mental dead end.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> all kids appear healthy, but the brains of a precious few are defective, and as aging exposes them to the challenge of correct diversification, it turns out they ~were all along~ schizophrenic. i currently find the notion persuasive. jane and jennifer are both interchangeable as 3 yos, but as they progress to age 23 it becomes apparent jeniffer just never had the tits in her and so... she's... you know, "modest". and has "morals". and all the rest of the bullshit. because if i make them strip, jane's DD look better than jen's A-.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> mircea_popescu never met a 'modest'+tits ?</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> asciilifeform shellshocked, yes.<sup><a href="#footnote_11_79456" id="identifier_11_79456" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Recall the story of that wedding ? Or that other one about the chick that I had to have a doctor scare out of anorexia which I seem to have momentarily misplaced.

'tis what it is.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> is this observation or postulation ?</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> it's my current mental model. now, obviously other than the people who ~are made of~ shit, you can also have people covered in shit. these, however, can wash. even if they're not necessarily distinguishable on superficial examination -- put the firehose on them and you'll presently find out. which'd be ~why~ specific republican artefacts (above approximated as firehose) result in the "educational split"<sup><a href="#footnote_12_79456" id="identifier_12_79456" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Ie, some thrive, some don't.">xiii</a></sup> so to speak.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> could just as easily say 'left-handedness expresses itself in fundamentally defective individuals'</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> could, yes. but more appropriately i think you could say "cowardice expresses itself in fundamentally defective individuals, as well as in those who spend too much time in cowards' company".</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> distinguish, for my education, 'socialism', from how the spartans lived. (they -- also -- 'cowardice' ? )</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> socialism is the proposal that the problems of individuals will be addressed by the group. the spartans made no allowance for the problems of individuals. they were interested in resolving the problems of the group, mostly in the shape of not getting wiped by the parthians. but anyway, thinking about it, it'd seem to me the only possible explanation of http://btcbase.org/log/2017-04-09#1641002<sup><a href="#footnote_13_79456" id="identifier_13_79456" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="`mircea_popescu NOW -- the question is why did this fucktarded dozen decide the best thing to do is make 3-6-howevermany `Competing` entitites.`">xiv</a></sup> is that the golden dozen lacked ~any conception whatsoever~ of the enmity of mit. like dodo birds, went happily to the necessary eventual slaughter because failed to perceive usg must be destroyed not ignored. in a field arbitrarily (and perhaps not exactly accidentally) limited in this manner<sup><a href="#footnote_14_79456" id="identifier_14_79456" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Something more recently referred to as the problems of `man alone` ">xv</a></sup>, they cultivated their own aesthetic notions of "competition" among themselves, instead of setting boston on fire.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> you could redefine this, if you wanted , as 'problem of individual'</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> yes, but you couldn't find petition introduced by hoplite because "life's too hard and i want an ipad". how the fuck they managed to think mit is anything but ~the only thing they must destroy~ is beyond me however. seriously, how the fuck does that work.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> pretty sure that, e.g., d. moon, saw 'finally we take this tech private, make an honest corp' as breaking off from mit and whatever socialisms dwelled there</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> possibly. why didn't it sell with the rest ?<sup><a href="#footnote_15_79456" id="identifier_15_79456" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The meaning of `selling` here is persuasion.">xvi</a></sup> bitcoin-assets split sold with the rest. why didn't moon's corp ?</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> i'm speaking of symbolics co</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> yes. why didn't everyone follow ? moon was eminently followable.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> why there was >1 power in 16th c italy. why not everyone simply in florence, lol. knight (inventor of the machine, and designer/hand-builder of almost all of the early iron) was also 'followable', he ended up at lmi.</p>

<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> im not sure that's even discussed, here. what theorems are involved in handmaking symbolics gear ?</p>

<p><b>phf</b> pre-symbolics the "theorems" were "how do i computer" in general. those guys weren't playing around with custom fpga in their garage that they failed to sell. they were basically figuring out how to build a von neumann machine that can do things, which they did</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> this part is fine. now, why did they fail to a) band together and b) control, deliberately, the product. they did a very strict anti-a and anti-b. why! the only reason mit even exists in this picture is because the dozen was "omfg, we DID figure it out, now quick, find someone TO PROTECT US FROM OUR HAVING FIGURED IT OUT!!1" holy shit who thinks like this and why do they.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> my understanding was that greenblatt and noftsker had serious disagreement re how to actually do business.

<p><b>asciilifeform</b> there is such a thing as an actual dispute.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> give me an example.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> let's say for sake of argument that greenblatt was 'the true king.' he had <a href=http://trilema.com/2018/the-republic-without-mp/>no mechanism</a> for somehow forcing the others to come along. so off he went, with subset of the possible participants. the rest -- with someone else.</p>

<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> asciilifeform indulge me for a moment here. so, would you agree that a specific and specified problem (make a computer!) was actually resolved by a number of people ?</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> i don't actually see it as resolved, even today. attempted - yes. resolved - no.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> so you don't particularily want symbolix metal, it's just some random thing.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> not random, no.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> then gimme something.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> picture if we had no jet turbine.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> so then why do you deny ?</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> say it was tried in ww2, and then not again. bolix box would then be me262. fairly primitive, early attempt, but -- not continued.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> you'll have to pick a door (for the needs of this conversation only)</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> me262 had quite serious problems, from practical pov. the analogy is not a whim of asciilifeform's, it is quite exact -- what bolix et al did, was a 'stretch' of the tech of the time, quite near its breaking point the trouble is that this is how tech actually advances. early steamboats were expensive deathtraps (boiler explosions were still a quite familiar thing in mark twain's time, even)</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> look, there's no crevice here to slither into. either you grant "they did" or else you admit they didn't do anything. pick one.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> this dichotomy is a hallucination of mircea_popescu's , and i ain't buying.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> aite, then i guess it can't be explained what the people invovled were stupid for having not done.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> they took a serious technological risk - and lost, like dirigible; rather than won, like steamboat.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> you will note however that ~all communication~ rests on hallucination in the sense here contemplated. and we're right back to 4->5.</p>
<p><b>phf</b> there's only one computer asciilifeform acknowledges as "resolved", and that's the computer built by asciilifeform. i suspect similar dynamic was at the root of smbx/lmi.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> a bolix-style machine that -- hypothetically - could have cost-competed with the 'i can't believe it's not butter' state of the art, would imho count as 'resolve'.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> phf im starting to understand the problem though. here it is : engineer will not consider inconvenient problems.

<p><strong>asciilifeform</strong> it is quite impossible to 'unconsider inconvenient problem' in a thread about bolix, which is in a way a parable re engineers going to the bottom of the sea</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> you just did.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> my contention is simply that they failed to ~resolve~ their problem , in the sense of achieving item#2 from my http://www.loper-os.org/?p=305 essay. because -- cost.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> but that is not the sense contemplated in context.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> let's have expansion re the sense contempated by mircea_popescu then. possibly i'm thick.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> i'm not capable nor interested in specifying. fact remains - a dozen dudes either did something or didn't do something. if they did something we can discuss the history of the thing they did and what it says about them ; otherwise, we can not. and no, it's not an ~exact~ dozen, either.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> they built something quite like a proper comp. but were unable to build it economically, or live long enough on 'credit card' to live to see the cheap-enough transistor. (they eventually resorted to 'credit card' and ended up simply making a titanic black hole for entire ~industry~ to fall into, when it finally imploded)</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> alright, so then let's continue from there. at the time they did this, the world split. there were the people who built the "something quite like a proper comp", on one side. there were the people who did not so build, on the other side. you see this ?</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> aha...</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> crossed this line -> stupid.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> what means to cross this line ?</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> Crossing this line means transforming a world which is ontologically constituted as "12 men on a monkey island" into an absurd counter-reality where we're invited to lay bets on either team A (two men and monkeys) or team B (three men and monkeys). It is not permissible, under any circumstances, howsoever manipulated, misrepresented, misstated, what have you, for any man to ever participate in any team that contains even a single monkey for as long as there's a different team with any men in it. The expression is "blood is thicker than water", and what it means is that you will not ever fucking cross the line to go be with the monkeys no matter what the fuck happens and what mommy says about how greatly <a href=http://trilema.com/2018/an-examination-of-conflict/>the monkey fucked her</a>.<sup><a href="#footnote_32_79456" id="identifier_32_79456" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This line was completely reconstructed for this second edition.

<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> who starved ? other than rms.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> nobody starved, but the lispm was abandoned, the way moon rocket was, as a 'neato but sorry, -ev' item. because yes the monkeys could win if not enough to eat, BUT you know this because there's 12 starved men. and when the necessary transistors were finally ~free, they went to tlb cache instead so that winblowz could run 5% faster.</p>

<p><b>trinque</b> dunno what's hard about the notion that look, you do not get computers until you have both the leadership category and engineering category maxed on your character, and that the folks that "tried" in the first round lost because of deficiency of character</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> trinque one possibility was 'too many chiefs, not enough indians' (tm). which is sorta opposite, as i understand, to your hypothesis.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> i didn't perceive this cheifdom in the chief characters. mebbe my antennae too blunt, but who ? how ?</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> self-perceived, this chiefdom. greenblatt thought he could lead. etc</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> but he was more or less irrelevant. moon, knight etc. anyway, imo the principal point of the discussion is that knowledge, any knowledge, enacts a partition upon the world. this is the only difference - chucka and man are distinguished not by skin color, not by anything else but the overpowering fact that chuka doesn't know what to do with the <a href="http://trilema.com/forum-logs-for-20-mar-2017#2255539">rtg</a> ; or with pushkin ; or with etcetera. disconsidering this fundamental in any manner opens the chasm of hell, in all its presentation from evil to insanity.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> so far i follow the logic..</p>
