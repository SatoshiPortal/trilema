<b>LordMPofTMSR</b> hey!<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> hey</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> win<br />
<b>LordMPofTMSR</b> anyway, you don't know what irc is ?<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> no I actually don't. technology is the one area I don't have much knowledge in - which is definitely an issue considering it's 2018 lol</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> lol. what do you do for a living ?<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> I'm a student, majoring in human biology<sup><a href="#footnote_0_80282" id="identifier_0_80282" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="You know biology students seem to work quite well ?">i</a></sup> and hoping to go to medical school<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> yourself? </p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> i'm... ah, you don't know who i am huh.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> oh I already did my internet searching trust me lol<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> but asking directly tends to get you good answers</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> lol. so basically i lord over a buncha projects / people.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> a hardcore, tech-savvy supervisor </p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> you know ?<sup><a href="#footnote_1_80282" id="identifier_1_80282" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Tech savy, you hear that ? I hope we understand each otherrrrr!!111">ii</a></sup> stuff sluts' nightmares are made of.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> the best sluts have good dreams about the things normal people consider nightmares </p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> this is quite so.<br />
<b>LordMPofTMSR</b> do you want to tell me some ?<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> my sexual dreams? I could write an entire saga.... probably longer than lord of the rings lol </p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> you ever read http://trilema.com/2017/mom/ ?<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> I haven't but I will now. love that you write</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> there's really a lot on trilema ; once you're done with that, the continuation is http://trilema.com/love-in-an-elevator<br />
<b>LordMPofTMSR</b> and i shall be off to town ; but if you're around later drop a line, we'll chat smore.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> I'll be around. message me when you're free :)</p>
<p><font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> love that story by the way. brutal gang bangs are on the top of my wishlist to try </p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> look at this :<br />
<b>LordMPofTMSR</b> * <font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> has joined #trilema<br />
<b>LordMPofTMSR</b> * <font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> has joined #trilema<br />

<b>LordMPofTMSR</b> * <font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> has quit (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)<br />
<b>LordMPofTMSR</b> stop doing that, it's stupid.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> I know it is, I don't do it on purpose</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> lol ok.<sup><a href="#footnote_2_80282" id="identifier_2_80282" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="What'd you have said, o ye technologically savy folk ? Hm ?">iii</a></sup><br />
<b>LordMPofTMSR</b> aaanyway, what were we saying ?<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> I believe we were discussing sexual fantasies</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> ah right, you were going to tell me some of yours.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> Honestly, it's easier to explain what I *don't* like because I'm very interested in a lot of things<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> I'll try pretty much anything twice</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> but you also have ~0 experience irl ?<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> I have ~23% experience<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> irl</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> ahahaah what the fuck. what did you divide to get that figure ?<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> wellll I figure I have a lot more experience than someone with none, but it felt overzealous to say I had experienced a quarter of things yet....but I've also tried a lot. so 23</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> they don't teach you statistics in biology anymore ?<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> would you like a normal distribution curve so I can approximate that number using my calculus skills? lol</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> "i tried 391 out of the 1700 things there are to try" is how you get 23%.<br />
<b>LordMPofTMSR</b> and if it's 39 out of 170 you don't have 23%, you have 20%. because significance is a thing. yes ?<br />
<b>LordMPofTMSR</b> the significance of your number is, wait for it... 0.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> in the grand scheme of everything I'd like to experience, its significant to 0</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> were you ever naked on the street ?<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> nope</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> at a club/bar/party ?<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> nope, I have started going to a swingers party, but I've never been nude in a typically vanilla environment<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> well actually<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> there was this party in high school where everyone dropped acid and I was naked the entire night.... so *Technically*</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> lol ok.<br />
<b>LordMPofTMSR</b> what's "started going to a swingers party" mean, you're not even married ?!<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> swingers party as in a group sex environment. maybe the terminology is distinctly different, is it? </p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> swingers means married people getting together to exchange partners. it's a... 1950s airforce/suburbia thing, mostly.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> gotcha. well this is just an orgy party lol<sup><a href="#footnote_3_80282" id="identifier_3_80282" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Because what they do these days for `swinger parties` is, everyone hires a whore and they show up with their `partners` to `exchange`. Most escorts even have specific tariffs for this service in their little book. All hail the mass culture.
By the way, remember back when `progress` was `consensus` and so the only way anyone ever denoted The Republic was by presuming it is the avant-garde of the place the fucktarded dullards are all headed eventually anyway ? What a sickening way of looking at things!">iv</a></sup></p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> aaanyway. ever had sex with someone not your age / from your environment / however you politely say "as dumb as you in the same exact ways" ?<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> as dumb as myself?<sup><a href="#footnote_4_80282" id="identifier_4_80282" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="It stings, because imagine this wonder -- nobody told her before she's fucking stupid. The only true lot of infancy, childhood and adolescence, sheer and unmitigated idiocy, and nobody diagnosed it for her. Not ever.
You are remiss in your duty and derelict of life!">v</a></sup></p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> you know what fashions are, right ? like how everyone in the 70s had the ridiculous hair ? and the pants ?<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> yes trends</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> ok. ever had sex with anyone who wasn't in your own cultural bubble.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> yes</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> wanna tell me about it ?<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> well.... I fucked one of the professors at my college. not my own - I don't need to fuck for a grade, but yeah I liked his position so I fucked him</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> did he teach you anything ?<br />
<b>LordMPofTMSR</b> i don't mean, in his subject matter.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> the professor? he didn't teach me anything really but fucking him somewhat ignited a sexual revolution I was/am still going through. Basically I want every experience I can get<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> I also had a little stint talking to this one guy who loved watching me fuck BBC. I was raised in a very suburbia, upper middle class white area, so going to the ghetto and taking bbc from older black men with a much lower vocabulary than mine was an experience </p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> did you do a lot of that ?<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> I fucked 5 BBC's for him and filmed everything</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> why ?<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> because I'm kinky as hell and want to try everything </p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> did anything interesting come of that ? personally i mean.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> yes. I wasn't attracted to black men at all before that, now I love getting fucked by BBC lol<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> definitely led to a great change of mindset</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> that's rather impersonal, isn't it ?<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> well what do you have in mind as being personal? </p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> you ever seen glengarry glenn ross ? the movie ?<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> no I haven't </p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> ah. well, pacino has a few great lines in them, one of which being, "the fucking's not generally what you remember of the great lays you might have had. but some noise the broad made, the way she held her arm..."<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> well... I don't know. all the meetings were very impersonal honestly... I wasn't interested in sticking around or getting to know them </p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> why not ?<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> I'm not attracted to anything other than their cocks and what the dynamic represents..... so I'm not really trying to cuddle and talk  much lol</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> what does the dynamic "represent" ?<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> I like being a little white slut that takes huge black cock. If we really wanna dig deep we can talk about how it represents a flip in social norms, talk about how it represents true dominance - black man destroying the white girl that would've oppressed him 60 years ago during Jim Crowe USA. Where I grew up, there's still some racism too and even though I consider myself quite progressive, I was around a lot of people th<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> I'm not supposed to be fucking them. white people are "above" them (not true but some people still believe it)<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> so it like feeling like a dirty slut being taken raw by people some of society view as below me </p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> eh get out, destroying my foot. it's not made of soap, you know.<br />
<b>LordMPofTMSR</b> all this is so much esltard wank.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> esltard? </p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> a sec<br />
<b>LordMPofTMSR</b> here : <a href=http://trilema.com/republican-thesaurus/#selection-101.0-103.1>trilema.com/republican-thesaurus/</a><br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> so english as a single language combined with retarded? </p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> exactly.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> so I sound too american?<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> these are obviously new terms to me</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> you know how populations stuck on islands degenerate ? just so culturally, provincial peoples degenerate, end up with these highly wrought piles of nonsense.<br />
<b>LordMPofTMSR</b> i don't think you're too american, for one thing america is where i live, you know<sup><a href="#footnote_5_80282" id="identifier_5_80282" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="It's a continent. The United States dangles off the side of it like stinky dangles off the underside of donkey.">vi</a></sup> ? but i do think the people you're around are pretty... how shall we put it... narrowminded ?<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> lol you can say that again. my immediate friends and nuclear family are quite openminded but the community I was raised in isn't<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> I live in mid-michigan. you can imagine.. it's quite narrow-minded<sup><a href="#footnote_6_80282" id="identifier_6_80282" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I can't imagine, because counterexamples I won't go into the details of are all I know.">vii</a></sup></p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> but this entire "bbc" that as-fucking-if "destroys" bla bla, is just wank of a different color. as if instead of a red lampshade you put a yellow lampshade. same fucking lamp.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> that's a very fair statement </p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> and i think it's a little bit wasteful to fuck some guy you don't even talk to. because who knows, maybe the black guy some retard reduced and repackaged for you as "bbc" had something actually meaningful to say to you.<br />
<b>LordMPofTMSR</b> if you but listened to the guy you're fucking instead of some rando maniac ranting and raving behind imaginary cameras on a set that only he can see.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> lol somehow you understand my situation without me even needed to explain it</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> i am known for this.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> i think it was important for me to learn how to fuck without any connection however. useful skill to have </p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> no dispute.<br />
<b>LordMPofTMSR</b> but anyway, free bit of advice from guy you ran into on the internets, whether he somehow understands your situation without your even needed to explain it or not :<br />
<b>LordMPofTMSR</b> the principal problem for you is running into idiots masquerading as doms.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> absolutely </p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> i have known girls with a lot of baggage as a result of rando idiots pretending their abusive nonsense is bdsm.<br />
<b>LordMPofTMSR</b> generally, they're 23-25 ; when they were your age they i expect they sounded a lot more like you.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> my most recent experience was definitely that scenario</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> how did that go ?<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> uhhhhhhh </p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> what, you're bad at storytelling or something ? go ahead, let's hear.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> started with a guy on fet saying he's the guy in http://www.wired.com/2014/01/openbsd/</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> ahahaha what!<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> ended awfully<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> it's embarrassing but I totally got catfished. I'm a smart girl, but this guy was an absolute psychopath. he toyed me along for like 2 months and he spun an extremely good story<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> but I also wanted it to be real so I was more inclined to believe the good and ignore the bad<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> but I fucked 5 bbcs for him, listened to everything he asked of me, filmed everything and sent it to him, only to be stood up because he wasn't who he said he was. It was impulsive and now that I'm typing it out makes me sound like the dumbest girl out there, but you know how manipulative people can be<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> and he was older, experienced, offered me money, and was kinky and was helping me explore things i wanted. it was the type of relationship I've realized I very much want, and so yeah a lot o factors played a role as to why I was so gullible</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> so you fucked some guys, not the end of the world.<sup><a href="#footnote_7_80282" id="identifier_7_80282" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Can you believe this insane shit, by the way ?">viii</a></sup><br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> it bothers me that I was lied to, and knowing that those videos with my face in it are out there. It's probably fine, but what it, you know? </p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> from what you're describing odds are you'd hurt him more by publishing them yourself lmao.<br />
<b>LordMPofTMSR</b> the sort tends to treasure the items. anyways.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> especially because I still need to get into graduate school and eventually a residency program. obviously he's a psycho so what would stop him from going one step further and posting everything somewhere? </p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> i wouldn't be too worried about it, i don't know anyone who's anyone and would seriously hold stag against a girl.<br />
<b>LordMPofTMSR</b> now the opposite, "eh, she doesn't even have sex tapes" as a put-down, now that i heard plenty of times.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> but yeah he's probably fat and old and will probably just wank to them forever, which is fine - he outsmarted me he deserves the fruits of his labor. as long as they're kept private lol</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> and if they're public what ?<br />
<b>LordMPofTMSR</b> you've seen buncha girls on my profile, not like they died from it.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> but he was quite manipulative and I knew it wasn't proper BDSM but i went along with it because the person he was impersonating was hot as hell lol </p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> was this on fetlife ?<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> met him on fetlife yes</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> but i mean... how do you mean impersonate ?<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> kik</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> that didn't enlighten me...<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> google images, instagram, knowing your lie inside and out, and being a psychopath all help<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> we talked almost daily for almost 3 months. that's just cruel.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> internet people are craaaazy<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> this person catfished as their passion, they invested time into the process</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> i never heard anything like this from a fetgirl before.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> really? </p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> honestly.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> well I'm young and naive i suppose</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> reasonably rare, i talk to a lot.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> but I'm not stupid. I'm quite intelligent actually, which is why I'm so disappointed and surprised in myself </p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> i can tell.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> and frustrated</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> cuz stuck in shittygan ?<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> no one plays me like this and gets away with it irl lol</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> lol<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> being stuck in shittygan as well lol. beautiful state buuuuuut I'm moving to a city for med school</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> ah right, how about moving over here for a coupla weeks ?<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> you never know ;D</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> of course... my interests don't really run towards gangbangs and such.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> what are your interests? </p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> obedient girls, basically. the smarter the better.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> obedience is sexy </p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> ikr?<br />
<b>LordMPofTMSR</b> but! you may be too young to be enslaved, honestly.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> I want a master because I want to learn to be more obedient. I've always had issues with being impulsive, and blindly driven by my strong emotions</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> hm.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> why do you say that? I agree, but why do you say </p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> yes but listen, you're not even 20 yet. there's maybe some stupid you still gotta get out of your system ?<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> honestly..... got a lot of stupid out in my early days. I'm much more composed than many 19 year old girls<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> had many more experiences<sup><a href="#footnote_8_80282" id="identifier_8_80282" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="And she also dropped the percentiles, just to humor me!">ix</a></sup></p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> well be that as it may, it won't be discerned over the internets anyways.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> I don't need to do stupid things other kids my age are doing because I was the crazy kid that did that at 13/14<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> but i still have some left in me of course, I'm very young</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> generally it's "come for a coupla weeks, if i like you you may stay". in your case it's more like "come for a coupla weeks, we'll have fun and if you truly really want it... ill think about it"<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> it would be interesting<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> but I'm also not a drop everything for a life of sexual slavery kinda girl </p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> you'd be in a proper house though, no bs.<br />
<b>LordMPofTMSR</b> you'd have to behave.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> i would love to experience that environment<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> it would be extremely interesting</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> would it ?<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> yes I've always wanted to see how a "proper" BDSM household operates. I think it would be interesting. even if I don't enjoy it I would highly revere the experience</p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> because even senior girls can get in trouble and end up with a few red welts on their backside in short order. it's pretty intense<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> that does sound a little scary, in all honesty, but that's what makes me intrigued </p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> that said, i don't expect i'm very typical, in all honestly. not that such a thing as "typical" exists outside of faker-fanfic.<br />
<b>LordMPofTMSR</b> but generally i'd guess i'm a lot more relaxed than most.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> really? </p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> well yes.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> the breaking in period...seems as though it would be a lot<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> I'm sure you have to bring down a heavy hand at first, to establish yourself no? </p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> nah.<br />
<font color=gray>lowly_slut</font> well that's nice to hear lol </p>
<p><b>LordMPofTMSR</b> lmao.<br />
<b>LordMPofTMSR</b> you'll do most of that for me yourself, why should i be bothered.</p>
<p>What can I say, "accept no substitutes" ?!</p>

						<p>No, because the average Indian or Arab kid posting <a href=http://trilema.com/2013/internet-story/#comment-148444 >here</a> is likely getting by on 1/5 or less per day of what the average Latino has available ; yet what the Arabs and Indians are out here looking for is girls. The Latinos are just begging.</p>
<p>Which brings to mind that the most striking characteristic of native indian populations to the European eye was... their propensity to beg. In which vein, let us quote Samuel Clemens : </p>
<blockquote><p>On the morning of the sixteenth day out from St. Joseph we arrived at the entrance of Rocky Canyon, two hundred and fifty miles from Salt Lake. It was along in this wild country somewhere, and far from any habitation of white men, except the stage stations, that we came across the wretchedest type of mankind I have ever seen, up to this writing. I refer to the Goshoot Indians. From what we could see and all we could learn, they are very considerably inferior to even the despised Digger Indians of California; inferior to all races of savages on our continent; inferior to even the Terra del Fuegans; inferior to the Hottentots, and actually inferior in some respects to the Kytches of Africa. Indeed, I have been obliged to look the bulky volumes of Wood’s “Uncivilized Races of Men” clear through in order to find a savage tribe degraded enough to take rank with the Goshoots. I find but one people fairly open to that shameful verdict. It is the Bosjesmans (Bushmen) of South Africa. Such of the Goshoots as we saw, along the road and hanging about the stations, were small, lean, “scrawny” creatures; in complexion a dull black like the ordinary American negro; their faces and hands bearing dirt which they had been hoarding and accumulating for months, years, and even generations, according to the age of the proprietor; a silent, sneaking, treacherous looking race; taking note of everything, covertly, like all the other “Noble Red Men” that we (do not) read about, and betraying no sign in their countenances; indolent, everlastingly patient and tireless, like all other Indians; prideless beggars—for if the beggar instinct were left out of an Indian he would not “go,” any more than a clock without a pendulum; hungry, always hungry, and yet never refusing anything that a hog would eat, though often eating what a hog would decline; hunters, but having no higher ambition than to kill and eat jack-ass rabbits, crickets and grasshoppers, and embezzle carrion from the buzzards and cayotes; savages who, when asked if they have the common Indian belief in a Great Spirit show a something which almost amounts to emotion, thinking whiskey is referred to; a thin, scattering race of almost naked black children, these Goshoots are, who produce nothing at all, and have no villages, and no gatherings together into strictly defined tribal communities—a people whose only shelter is a rag cast on a bush to keep off a portion of the snow, and yet who inhabit one of the most rocky, wintry, repulsive wastes that our country or any other can exhibit.</p>
<p>The Bushmen and our Goshoots are manifestly descended from the self-same gorilla, or kangaroo, or Norway rat, which-ever animal—Adam the Darwinians trace them to.</p>
<p>One would as soon expect the rabbits to fight as the Goshoots, and yet they used to live off the offal and refuse of the stations a few months and then come some dark night when no mischief was expected, and burn down the buildings and kill the men from ambush as they rushed out. And once, in the night, they attacked the stage-coach when a District Judge, of Nevada Territory, was the only passenger, and with their first volley of arrows (and a bullet or two) they riddled the stage curtains, wounded a horse or two and mortally wounded the driver. The latter was full of pluck, and so was his passenger. At the driver’s call Judge Mott swung himself out, clambered to the box and seized the reins of the team, and away they plunged, through the racing mob of skeletons and under a hurtling storm of missiles. The stricken driver had sunk down on the boot as soon as he was wounded, but had held on to the reins and said he would manage to keep hold of them until relieved.</p>
<p>And after they were taken from his relaxing grasp, he lay with his head between Judge Mott’s feet, and tranquilly gave directions about the road; he said he believed he could live till the miscreants were outrun and left behind, and that if he managed that, the main difficulty would be at an end, and then if the Judge drove so and so (giving directions about bad places in the road, and general course) he would reach the next station without trouble. The Judge distanced the enemy and at last rattled up to the station and knew that the night’s perils were done; but there was no comrade-in-arms for him to rejoice with, for the soldierly driver was dead.</p>
<p>Let us forget that we have been saying harsh things about the Overland drivers, now. The disgust which the Goshoots gave me, a disciple of Cooper and a worshipper of the Red Man—even of the scholarly savages in the “Last of the Mohicans” who are fittingly associated with backwoodsmen who divide each sentence into two equal parts: one part critically grammatical, refined and choice of language, and the other part just such an attempt to talk like a hunter or a mountaineer, as a Broadway clerk might make after eating an edition of Emerson Bennett’s works and studying frontier life at the Bowery Theatre a couple of weeks—I say that the nausea which the Goshoots gave me, an Indian worshipper, set me to examining authorities, to see if perchance I had been over-estimating the Red Man while viewing him through the mellow moonshine of romance. The revelations that came were disenchanting. It was curious to see how quickly the paint and tinsel fell away from him and left him treacherous, filthy and repulsive—and how quickly the evidences accumulated that wherever one finds an Indian tribe he has only found Goshoots more or less modified by circumstances and surroundings—but Goshoots, after all. They deserve pity, poor creatures; and they can have mine—at this distance. Nearer by, they never get anybody’s.</p></blockquote>
<p>Honestly I think it's genetic -- the unwelcome, regrettable fundamental characteristics of pre-Colombian native stock.</p>
