Ten bilion worldpop of which five and a half female and four and a half in cock cages rubbing soymilk on their fake boobs is but one small step down from nine billion &lt;a href=http://btcbase.org/log/2017-11-08#1733995 &gt;vacupacks&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

		<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;girlies&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I should probably also add sex &lt;/blockquote&gt;

But this is actually awesome. I grew up with all the Fox/baptist/retard conspiracy theories on TV (aliens, masons, jews, asteroids crashing into earth, mass poisoning by the government) and nothing happened, lol. Now something IS happening and it's fucking beautiful: autists.

I don't know what they call CP these days but the whole instawhore/fb shit is full of 13 yr old shaven pussy and they're like D cup, 170 cm tall and 2-chair wide ass; and I can't make sense if it's the food or Nature just trying to call for sex. And the ultrafeminist education, no touching, no fighting, no other communication than through sad boys songs and anime even better. They have like to dress into 2-5 different character suits before talking.</description>

		<description>It's a terrible thing, fuck "the vast populace" with a red hot poker. 

Also, nothing got cheaper -- everything worth having got &lt;a href=http://btcbase.org/log/2018-01-28#1777703 &gt;way the fuck more expensive&lt;/a&gt;, and the latrines of the poor got ever stinkier. Neither of these is an acceptable, let alone desirable result.</description>

		<description>So is this a good thing or?  What mostly happen is the influx of qty over quality. Before the internet was the place for better to do people, now is a place for the  vast populace, as the aeronautic travel industry i might add it became more affordable, hence less exclusive.

I think Bloging also came and went a bit too.</description>
