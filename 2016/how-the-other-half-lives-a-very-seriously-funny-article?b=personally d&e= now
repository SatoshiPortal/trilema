<blockquote><p><strong>How To Stop Spam Bot Registration??</strong><br />
Cary Silverman Member www.deadflyzone.com Posts: 17 4 months ago</p>
<p>I recently noticed that bots are registering as customers at my store at an alarming rate. <sup><a href="#footnote_4_70580" id="identifier_4_70580" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Have you noticed the double space post dot convention is a good predictor of a certain kind of stupidity ?">v</a></sup> The first and last name they use is a long series of letters and numbers and is accompanyed by a fake email address.  I did find an old thread here that gave instructions on how to add a simple math equation to the registration screen to stop bots from registering.  I added the code to the customers/register.liquid page and the math question showed up on the registration page, but it didn't stop the bots.  In fact, while the equation does show up, you can still register on my site without putting in the answer.<sup><a href="#footnote_5_70580" id="identifier_5_70580" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Yep, this kind of idiot, the sort that'd ask Popper whether you can `falsify falsification`, or check the color of bits. The kind that imagines his permission is required or even desired, the kind that wants to know if `my intentions are serious` etcetera etcetera.">vi</a></sup><br />
Ideally, I would just like to remove the text on the sign-in page that says " New Customer? Sign up → ".  I don't have a need for my customers to register on my store unless they are placing an order.<sup><a href="#footnote_6_70580" id="identifier_6_70580" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Bots are shaping the world. You don't want to think about it, and you like to imagine that whether you think about it or not, whether it applies to you personally or not, matters. It doesn't matter, and moreover there's a name for that fallacy. We call it `just want to`, after jwz.
Some idiot somewhere is doing a thing because my bot on whatever `platform` did something else. You had no idea my bot exists, because you personally didn't encounter it, because you personally don't even use that dumbass platform. And you never met the some idiot, either. And yet you can't elect your girl. No matter how much you wanted to, you can't. What now ?
Don't tell me Putin gave up on not understanding how the world works and moved on to influencing the election within one short year. What is this putin, some sort of pet rock/imaginary friend, you put it wherever you need it to be and it just magically fits ?
Here's the thing : shopify can't be worth money on the long term because the ecosystem it ultimately depends on to exist is composed of people like Cary Silverman on one end and C l a u d i a❗. on the other, which is to say it won't last for very long.">vii</a></sup>  If there is another way to stop the bots from registering, I would be open to that solution as well.  Thanks for any help.</p></blockquote>

This has become a seriously annoy occurrence with our shop.<br />
The post ecommerce.shopify.com/c/shopify-discussion/t/account-creation-spam-how-can-i-stop-it-299920 addresses this same issue, however falls short of a solid solution.<br />
The best hope is that Shopify come up with a built-in solution to stop this behaviour. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em>Cary Silverman Member www.deadflyzone.com Posts: 17 4 months ago</em><br />
Thanks Cole.  I saw that thread a few days ago and it offered no help at all.  I love how the Shopify Guru offered two solutions and then admitted he didn't know how to implement either of them.  WTF?  And he didn't even research it for the store owner.  Basically just said figure it out if you can.<br />
Sure would be nice if someone from Shopify chimed in here.  From reading the forums, this has been a problem with people's stores for a very long time and Shopify is basically ignoring our pleas.  I did send Sandbox (folks who designed the template I use) a message as well asking how to remove the ability to sign up for an account outside of checkout.  They have not bothered to answer me either.<br />
Great support from two companies I have given my $$ to<sup><a href="#footnote_7_70580" id="identifier_7_70580" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="O hey, speaking of which, anyone recall Groupon, that huge scam / major player in the ecosystem ?

Don't tell me it's sitting somewhere on a piece of paper as a purely notional asset waiting for `someone` to decide to roll it up into an even larger... purely notional asset ? I recall Microsoft paying 50 bn for Webvan, Facebook buying Skype for 50bn, Google buying Whatsapp for 50bn etc etc. Do they print these `50bn` tokens directly, or do they have to sit around and count benjies like old school frauds ?">viii</a></sup>.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em>Cary Silverman Member www.deadflyzone.com Posts: 17 3 months ago</em><br />
Finally heard back from Out of The Sandbox.  These are the folks that designed my template.  A real nice guy over there asked me to create a staff account for him on my site so he could make some changes to my language code.<br />
He took the option off the SIGN IN page that said  "New Customer?  Create an Account".  I didn't need visitors to my store to create an account unless they become customers.  They still have the option to create an account after the check-out process.  Removing the "New Customer?  Create an Account"  option on the SIGN IN page will eliminate spam bots from registering accounts on my site.  Problem solved.<sup><a href="#footnote_8_70580" id="identifier_8_70580" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="He thinks this because he is an idiot, and not merely the sort that puts two spaces after the final dot. He's the sort of idiot who thinks in terms of his own experience, he literally imagines that because he personally knows of no other way of using a link than through clicking the underlined thing on a page somewhere it then follows that no other way exists. 
This is the core of the `traditionalist` idiocy, the negative presumption, the expectation that his negative space is not merely an artefact of his own making, but outright a fair, complete and universal description of reality. His wife doesn't seem to enjoy a good lashing so therefore she wouldn't if I gave her one nor would any woman etcetera.  He's never seen his daughter swallow a snake so he has serious trouble dealing with all these young gents whose experience does not match his. Perhaps putin did it ?">ix</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em>Cary Silverman Member www.deadflyzone.com Posts: 17 Last edited 3 months ago</em><br />
Well, scratch my last update.  Problem still exists.  Removing the "New Customer?  Create an Account"  button on my sign in page did not work.  The web designer at Out of The Sandox didn't think it would.  This is what he told me:</p>
<p>"Spam bots are annoying and the goal is to access information that they do not have access to. Unfortunately, removing links will not stop spam as spam bots automatically send a post request to the form, meaning they do not need to see the form or fill out anything to submit it, they can bypass this and submit the form. Unfortunately, Shopify does not provide the best protection against spam, however, I would consider having a look on Shopify's app store for an app that may help you deter spam bots."<sup><a href="#footnote_9_70580" id="identifier_9_70580" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="On the surface, this seems a perfect world - you create a shitty product, get listed on NYSE where you trade at 10 times (`industry` average 5.6!) the book which is cooked to high heavens anyway, on the general expectation that someone will pay money to buy your premium solution for a problem that exists because `of course` your product doesn't work. 
In reality, this is an extremely fragile world -- the sort of idiots that'd do this are entirely incapable of defending themselves from the smallest of challenges such as you know, `not sending their retirement savings to Nigeria because the man in the webpage said so`. Soon enough the cost of defending your herd of cattle from predators exceeds the benefits you accrue from owning it (because unlike the real bovine, the bovine-emulated-on-humans does not usefully graze) and then you get to say that `Apple could have bought Russia if only that Putin hadn't influenced TMSR`. You realise this is where we're headed, do you ?">x</a></sup><br />
At least he responded.  Shopify has excelled at ignoring me and this post.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em>Coel May Member Posts: 15 3 months ago</em><br />
The people that build bots are clever.<sup><a href="#footnote_10_70580" id="identifier_10_70580" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="So then why the fuck are you here ?
This is perenially the progre syllogism, `Putin is bad` and `Putin influenced the elections`. Why the fuck didn't you influence the elections then ?
All the Hollywood films I ever saw had this property whereby good effortlessly and of its own accord conquers evil. Do you recall this ? Every time the poor bad guy is running up and down collecting bricks, building nails, mixing mortar, then the good guy comes, farts accidentally while talking on the phone with his girlfriend and the whole empire of evil falls over.
So why aren't you influencing the elections then ?">xi</a></sup> Of course they are going to look at what will potentially hamper their efforts to post data, and naturally s form, with captcha etc. is going to be the first thing on that list. So if they can post data without the form, they will.<br />
The whole not situation (among other considerations) was why the self-hosted option was ruled out and Shopify was chosen.<br />
WordPress flags spam messages and does not publish them, just as I understand Shopify does. Maybe they could do the same with account creation too, and not have the email confirmation sent out until it is approved. Then one's inbox will not fill up with needless "undeliverable mail" notifications.<br />
Or maybe there is a better solution.<br />
Or maybe there is no solution.<sup><a href="#footnote_11_70580" id="identifier_11_70580" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Or maybe stupid women should stop fucking drunks.">xii</a></sup></p></blockquote>

Have obtained a php data post script which I then ran on our store. Sure enough, there was the customer.<br />
However, after going to Settings -> Checkout -> Accounts are disabled, running the script again did not result in an account being created (because they are disabled).<br />
If you do not want accounts, I would suggest doing that.<br />
We, however, wish to allow customers the option of creating an account, so this solution is not for us.</p></blockquote>

Since a customer registration is just a form POST to Shopify, it is pretty simple to just disable this POST action. A Spam Bot will thus be unable to submit the form.<br />
When a real customer fills in the form, you can tell they are a real customer by asking them to do a simple test. For example, if they are really human, ask them a question like what is 5+8 in a text box. If they answer 13, you pretty much know it is not a Bot.<sup><a href="#footnote_15_70580" id="identifier_15_70580" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="How many humans (by smell, as he says) would fail this test, in your estimation ?

For those more curious, the script I used can be found at stackoverflow.com/questions/1217824/post-to-another-page-within-a-php-script<br />

<blockquote><p><em>Coel May Member Posts: 15 3 months ago</em><br />
Cary,<br />
The script demonstrates how the bots are able to create accounts without the use of the account creation page on your (any other) Shopify site by sending data straight to the post URL. That's why putting captcha, maths problems, etc. on the account signup page is never going to work: the bots bypass it.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em>Cary Silverman Member www.deadflyzone.com Posts: 17 3 months ago</em><br />
Thanks Cole.  When I added a math problem to the sign up page, you could still create an account without even answering it, so that didn't work either.  I understand what you're saying however.

My store has started getting hit through the create account page, about 70 a day so far and building.

<blockquote><p><em>HunkyBill Shopify Expert experts.shopify.com/resistor-software Posts: 3590 3 months ago</em><br />
Cole makes a valid point. Anyone can quickly determine where to POST accounts simply through discovering the shop URL. At that point, all bets are off.<br />
So you can turn off customer accounts from that URL. Replace the customer sign-up with one that POSTS to an App instead<sup><a href="#footnote_21_70580" id="identifier_21_70580" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Gota xsell that app!">xxii</a></sup>, allowing/forcing any new account to first flow through the App. The App can then create the customer using the API.<br />
A wee bit of luxury would be a moderation queue built on top of this, allowing the merchant to add customers with a click after checking their account details out.<br />

Who's going to want to take their business, or keep it with a platform that can't protect against this very basic threat and shows little interest in doing so until it harms their business model.<br />
I've had it for today. So many more important things I could have been doing with my time and here I am dealing with something that is the responsibility of the platform maker, not down to an app developer to create a solution to a problem that shouldn't exist.</p></blockquote>
