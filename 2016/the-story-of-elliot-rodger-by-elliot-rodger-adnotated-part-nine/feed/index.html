		<description>"Family" (in the sense of inheritance you imply) has relatively little to do with wealth in these days of rambunctious socialism. (Though "family" in the sense of progeniture is still the marker of poverty among they in a certain way afflicted it always was, today just as much as in the days of the potato famine. Even though back then the affliction was dubbed "catholicism" or "being Irish" whereas today the nominal conventions differ, the substance's unchanged.) "The third world" as an imaginary locus never had nor will ever have anything to do with either urban habits or more generally the passtimes of the elite.

All that aside, eating out is not, nor ever was, nor ever should be a proletarian activity. It's fine and dandy that you occasionally treat your indigent family of five to whatever it is you can get ; but your scrounging is of no interest to the world, nor your experience relevant to anyone beyond yourself, nor do you have, properly speaking, any business whatsoever involving yourself (or rather, purporting to involve yourself) in this whole business. Legend has it that a certain Mr. Bourdieu one day was flattered to discover he's his whole life spoken prose ; this is scant excuse to proceed to writing it. 

As far as actual people are concerned, doing actual things -- not you nor your narrow circle of lame would-be people, trying to imitate peoplehood and peopleship as best you manage -- a hundred dollars or so a head is a sort of baseline. In summa : very very far from daring to propose what I should do, see instead your own place, enjoy the happy meal, and shut the fuck up about "how things are", for you don't belong here, but are just (for a time) tolerated, especially while quiet.</description>

		<description>For a party of three ? In 2014 ? This is pretty cheap even for the third world, isn't it ?

I stumbled on your site while I was searching for Sakana Sushi and I found the comment you wrote up there ridiculous. 
I think you need to get your fact right before writing something like that on the public. Most of the 3rd world countries are underdeveloped economically or just starting to develop and the people there barely afford to survive let alone indulge in a $200 meals. Wow. I'm a working class and the last time I treated my family of 5 was about $60-70 max at a Japanese Restaurant.

It seems to me that clearly you came from a well off family that $200 meal is nothing to you.</description>
