		<description>[...] This way I can look for I don't know what at some point in the future and not find it in the same manner here contemplated, because what is scum ever to engender besides more scum. [&#8617;]Or for that matter with any other portion of the "Latinoamerican" imaginarium -- because this is what all this junk is : Latino "militant marxism" wanna-be-a-white-man palaver, imported back into the white man's lands because... well, frankly because meanwhile they've become so fucking impoverished they're stuck impressing the sangomas.

		<description>&gt; serious abuses of the human rights of the complainant

The concept of "human rights" exists, both historically and substantially, as protection for the individual -- and strictly the individual -- against insult by organized mediocrity, historically various camarillas but substantially these days any of the few flavours of socialism.
