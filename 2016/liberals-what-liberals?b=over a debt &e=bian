<p>Let's try to separate (and adnotate) a single thread out of a <a href=http://log.mkj.lt/trilema/20161120/#285>complex and convoluted log</a> :</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> tries to read bartle because people keep insisting<sup><a href="#footnote_0_70002" id="identifier_0_70002" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I'm lead designer for humanity's last hope a computer game may be created that's actually worth playing, and therefore everyone's trying to help as best they can.">i</a></sup>. aside from his tiresome cabotinism (really bitch, mud1 is a major point of reference, because why, you never heard of rogue/nethack or what) he's about as sighted as a snail. </p>
<blockquote><p>cyberpunk teaches designers a number of valuable lessons about the sociology and psychology of players and the responsibilities of developers. virtual worlds are not insulated from the real world ; they can't be regarded as solely the purview of their designers, publishers, or even players. their influence extends into the real world, and therefore the real world extends into them. ultimately, though, the relationship is one sided : the real world always wins in the end</p></blockquote>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> holy shit learn to distinguish fact and desire. or whatever, hillary 2016!</p>
<p><b>Framedragger</b> !#s simondon<br />
<b>a111</b> 0 results for "simondon".</p>
<p><b>Framedragger</b> ^ this guy (died ca. 1960?) had things to say about cyberpunk. deleuze stole from him. iirc theres an essay on technical object, i admit to not reading it in whole, it's in mah list tho. but, it has that.. continental philosophy style. however, compared to deleuze and derrida, much less bullshit-y.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> cyberpunk as understood by bartle-likes is very different from what you think when you use the term. in this dork's mind it's strictly us, and a consumer affair, of the 70s. like disco hair, us-gayness, pulp fiction or mechanical pianos.  "no matter how you do your hair, you still gotta wake up when the alarm rings on monday morning" === "the real world always wins in the end"..</p>
<p><b>Framedragger</b> aha. mh yeah that sounds pretty derp.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> it's soundly set on the footing of "i have no philosophy, just some hobbies to pass the time". americana entire, moreso than picket fences. kinda why they spent the 90s fascinated with fad diets and "issues". content-free "people".</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> speaking of this, and re </p>

">ii</a></sup>) and<br />
 b) it made people do sensible things such as making pgp keys. a certain amount of this "wash yourself" "read a book" basic training will have to be done forcibly, because ontogenesis may follow philogenesis, but it sure as fuck dun follow kalliergesis<sup><a href="#footnote_2_70002" id="identifier_2_70002" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="You know how a young enough human embryo will appear indistinguishable from a fish or a reptile or whatever other common ancestor ?

The things that matter aren't inborn, but selected for and trained, in this order.">iii</a></sup>. more importantly c) intelligent folks know about it but dun seem inclined to try it ; perhaps because preconceived notions (oh, a game is below my intelligence and i couldn't be happy with a black woman), perhaps for whatever other cause. so you know, yes i do spend my money to make the world a less shitty place but plox don't take this as some sort of free radical ready to be combined with your stubborn refusal and yield whatever nutty interpretation. it ain't that free a radical.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> 'min wage' as found in usa and elsewhere is a complex and long-term parasitic relationship, not a d00d who throws a penny at a bootblack and expects something other than derisive smirk. the 'min wage' folx do this thing... where was the thread, with the 'we make a home!'<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> your fixation with "a penny" doesn't help however. it wasn't a penny, it was more than they make at home.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> but a 1time moar, neh?<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> neh. it was open ended.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> i'ma stfu re this point, because i never eulora'd. so i have nfi.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> neither did they :) it was an epic, explosive proof of the whole "poor people are poor because they are stupid, and for no other reason."<sup><a href="#footnote_3_70002" id="identifier_3_70002" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This is the cornerstone truth that your own stupid mind and the collection of monkeys on your back don't want you to learn.

PS. If what you're about to say reduces to `not according to himself`, please shut up. I don't mean here - I mean everywhere else. Just shut the fuck up, universally and permanently.">iv</a></sup></p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> if it actually contains a 'min wage' apparatus inside somewhere, that these folx could theoretically pay rent from, i take it all back.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> if you were to write timetables, how much time would you count "generate a pgp key and register it with deedbot" ? full hour ? ten minutes ? full day ?</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> it depends -- must i first learn the alphabet ?<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> this is not how this job works.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> well, for the purpose of this hypothetical, gotta pick, man or monkey. if monkey - i cannot answer , i am not a trainer of monkeys, do not know how long it takes.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> you familiar with how army works ? </p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> yes.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> to load up f-19 with sidewinders, 32 minutes. to refuel plane under deck, 117 minutes. etc.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> but army has iq cutoff.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> use the same cutoff. or use whatever sane cutoff. after all - this is human resource engineering not metaphysics.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> i'd give a literate tank loader , say, 30 min. to make pgp key.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> so then. by this token working eulora would have paid them MORE than what going to college would have paid them.<sup><a href="#footnote_4_70002" id="identifier_4_70002" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Here's some actual data (courtesy of Neil Swidey for the Boston Globe) : 
Dean College sits on a pretty, leafy campus in Franklin. A former two-year college, it began offering a selection of bachelor’s degrees only about a decade ago. It now accepts about 70 percent of the students who apply, the same rate as Fitchburg State University. Last year, Dean sent a financial aid award letter to an accepted student whose family, the federal government had determined, was so poor that the “expected family contribution” (EFC) to that student’s education was zero. The college awarded the student a Dean Presidential Grant of $17,000 and another nearly $13,000 in institutional, federal, and state grants, meaning that almost $30,000 of the bill was covered and never had to be paid back. Sounds great, right? Yes, until you look at the larger numbers on the award letter. The total cost of attendance — tuition, room, board, and fees — was $53,120. That meant the gap that this “zero-EFC” student had to cover through loans and other means in order to attend was more than $23,000. Per year. Over four years — and with only modest rises for inflation factored in — that total gap could be expected to climb to around $100,000, not counting future interest payments. That’s a ton of debt, particularly for a degree from a college whose median annual salary for alumni 10 years after enrolling is just $32,700.
To Dean’s credit, about half of its students who pursue a bachelor’s degree manage to graduate. Contrast that with Becker College in Worcester. On its website, Becker talks about being able to trace its roots back to two signers of the Declaration of Independence. It does not, however, mention what US Department of Education data from 2012-2013 show: namely, that just 16 percent of Becker’s students managed to graduate in four years, a number that inches up only to 24 percent when the time frame is extended to six years, the federal standard for completing a bachelor’s degree. In other words, 3 out every 4 students who enrolled as freshmen at Becker failed to graduate. Nor does the website mention that, after all grants and discounts are applied, a typical zero-EFC low-income student is required to come up with more than $25,000 every single year to cover the costs of attending Becker.
This seems to be the operating calculus at many small, private, nonselective or less selective colleges across the region, which routinely accept more than 60 percent of applicants. Consider the average annual “net” prices — after discounts and grants have been deducted — that these colleges are charging students coming from families whose total adjusted gross annual income is $30,000 or less. At a surprising number of colleges, this annual net price represents nearly all of that family’s total income for the year.
That 100k is not merely collosal, it is also coming at the wrong time (there's a reason why saving a dime when you're 20 gives you a lot more than saving a dime when you're 50) and out the wrong end (you will repay that out of your salary which is the wrong degree of chumpatronicity).
Think this through. Tandala undertakes 100k of debt, and of the magical sort that can't ever be discharged. This will cost him a solid 5k a year in service alone. What exactly does he get in exchange ? He's not adding 5k of earning power, not even by a longshot. On the contrary - he's building unreasonable expectations for himself, the sort that'll keep him from the more lucrative blue collar jobs, and he's setting the idiocy down in cement. Had he just built unreasonable expectations for himself, nurturing delusions about how he's really a writer/singer/songwriter/activist (seems to be fashionable these days) and thus too good to do my plumbing, hunger may have eventually cured him. But once he pours the cement of a large pile of debt into his cost structure there's no saving him, that extra 5k a year has to come from somewhere, and it won't be coming from me. Unlike him, I can't be coerced. Unlike him, I can't be deluded. 
A college degree marks very strictly the difference between hunger-which-cures and hunger-which-kills, and if you permit your children to pursue one, you're permitting them to commit suicide. Quite literally, suicide. College kills more people than drunk driving - and you don't let the kids drive drunk, do you ?">v</a></sup> which means that if i charged them 50k a year for four years in advance - they'd be about even.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> well that's for the intro. but does it smell sufficiently like 'meal ticket' ? how much play does it take to extract, say, 1btc, with 'manual labour' ? (1 btc / mo. will buy a starvation-level existence in the cheaper parts of usa. supposing you also know how to convert it to zimbabwistan currencies.)<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> there's no manual labour, it's a computer. but, that aside, with no actual work (ie, on a windows machine, which is how we say "unprogrammable computer") something like a coupla weeks. and for the record, i pegged same at 1hr rather than 30mins, but anyways.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> would this 'mineral' coin remain, waiting to be dug out, in the game, if sizeable population of these folx actually appeared to look for it ..?<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> no. i would have obviously been forced to end it eventually. however, they didn't even come fucking close to giving me a run for my money.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> perhaps these people are slightly more 'long term' thinkers than appearances let on ? and mother taught them 'no free lunch'<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> understand the forces at work here - some dork famously promised to pay anyone commenting in his thing 1 bitcent if trump won. then trump won, and he ran off <span style="background-color:#d3d3d3" id="select">over a debt of ... 25btc, accumulated from a "massive" 2500 comments. i on the other hand paid out <a href=http://trilema.com/2014/an-era-ends-today-a-new-era-starts-today/>1k btc</a> on a whim. so yes - there'd be need for either 40 reddits ; or else you know, for less amphibian</span> brains. but the "long term thinker" theory utterly fails when confronted with daily reality.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> notice how 'civilians' (reddit folk etc) still react in disbelief when they read about mpex having worked as-described ? they will sooner believe in telekinesis, ufo proctologists abducting 50yo d00dz, divine healings, etc. because a d00d keeping promises re money is so far removed from everyday experience of homo americanicus,<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> anyway - the point remains, there are REASONS i / we discredit things. there ACTUALLY WAS A WAY for "bitcoin community" on tardstalk to impress me. just as there was a way, <a href=http://trilema.com/2013/bitcoind-not-quite-ready-for-prime-time/#selection-111.0-111.55>years ago</a>, for "bitcoin developer community" to impress me. that these doors successively close doth not mean they weren't there.</p>
<p><b>shinohai</b> found it a rather fun experiment, learned quite a bit along the way.<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> monkeys do not know how to turn door knob. then -- or now.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> and therefore people are poor because stupid and for no other reasons. but anyway - at issue is not what is claimed / appears to be at issue. at issue is that people want to be paid to do what they were going to do anyway, and not, for any reason, not ever, be paid to change what they do or how they do it. which is why i got all the fiverr dorks <a href=http://trilema.com/2016/theyre-not-progressive-theyre-just-lazy-a-practical-exercise/>failing miserably</a> - they were simply applying the homer simpson heuristic - "i will now chomp my jaws and if a pie happens to go in the way a well"<sup><a href="#footnote_5_70002" id="identifier_5_70002" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Lisa on Ice, 1994 : 
Marge Simpson: Oh, I'd better go check on them. Now, Homer, don't you eat this pie.
Homer: All right, Marge.
[Marge exits]

Homer: -and if you get eaten, it's your own fault.
[He shuts his eyes, and moves toward the pie, making chomping motions, but hits his head on the stove hood]
Homer: OW! AH! Oh, my... oh, to hell with it.

">vi</a></sup>. which is why - write 2500 pointless comments on reddit, yay! but make yourself a key nay! consider the following amusing datapoint - other than the "intro" ie, first bitcent, people could make more through digging up ordinary claims for me. the way this works is that you end up with a lot of material, which has to be taken back to town, but you can't carry it, because overweight. there is A BOT! written, documented on wiki, discussed on channel, that shortcuts this. the few dudes who actually worked this dragged the fucking load BY HAND making DOZENS of trips. in spite of being told to read logs and read wiki. same thing could have been done by the built-in bot. in one trip. with all the oversight of looking over two times over six minutes.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> btw the same folx who spat on eulora coin -- happily jumped through 1,001 hoops to participate in pyramids on tardstalk etc. because, i suspect, they are not actually stupid, and pyramid offers the dull an opportunity to ~scam next level down~. whereas they could not see where greater fool is to come from at eulora. sorta how if i throw some gold dust in a crack in city pavement, it will not lead to a gold rush. but if in an old mine - it might.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> why not ? they could have sold fucking ebooks about how to make money, like all the other shit they do. what is an "infoproduct" and why doesn't this qualify ?</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> because even the dull know that bitcoin cannot be magicked out of the aether.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> get out of here. it's not even clear the general population knows it's not edible.<sup><a href="#footnote_6_70002" id="identifier_6_70002" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Literally. You recall the Turkey Horizon ?

">vii</a></sup><br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> actually this may well be. and this train of thought has gone off the cliff of asciilifeform's very, very limited experience with the Expertly Sad demographic.<br />
<b>Framedragger</b> i would wager a claim that hackernews folk - those who need the money and who click through - would be more motivated and more reflective than tardstalk kids (with large enough sample sizes to confirm). i'll consider finding some suitable wording to be posted there, assuming there being interest. (and yes HN is evil and it's possible it's censoring asciilifeform's posts)<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> you can try, our material generally lasts 1-2 hrs. there.<br />
<b>Framedragger</b> i've seen (and i've posted under a normal-to-their-eyes non-newbie account myself, but mine may have just not attracted interest), fuck them, yes.<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> what isn't clear to me is that we lose anything thereby. the hn, reddit, etc. bots+meatpuppets collectively sum to 0 imho.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> you will rediscover the same thing : that all the love for ycombinator comes out of the misplaced hopes of a bunch of potheads that graham will pay them to... be potheads. since thye have no such hope about me, they "don't like" me. and so on. it's an easy enough game to play, but honestly i'd rather move to thailand and "seduce" the local whores, $50 at a time.</p>
<p><b>Framedragger</b> oh, i hear you, i've no love there. but some smart people still hang out there. but, yes, naivete of the youth, i submit that i've nothing to show until i've something to show.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> in which vein, let me recount a little anecdote from personal history. so yesterday i went to a bdsm vip party. this consists of about a hundred people in a hotel rented for the purpose. i brought the hottest girl there, by a fat margin. i took up a loft, with a nice view on the people below, cropped her lightly<sup><a href="#footnote_7_70002" id="identifier_7_70002" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="You know, with a crop.">viii</a></sup>, fucked her and had a good time. while all this was going on, in a different place they were having an "auction" based on tokens from some dumbass website they have. because hey, selling the dumbasses for actual money would expose a) their collective poverty and b) force change.<sup><a href="#footnote_8_70002" id="identifier_8_70002" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="See this discussion of the particular pretense.">ix</a></sup> so they use tokens, which supposedly come "from activity", ie like reddit gold, but in practice are a transparent ploy to enforce a social hierarchy without social basis. ie, EXACTLY ycombinator.<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> usd is not so distant from reddit token. (in terms for how seriously heavy holders come by it)<sup><a href="#footnote_9_70002" id="identifier_9_70002" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This point is very strictly correct - they're not even on the level of ethereum, nor will they ever be.">x</a></sup></p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> a dude "won" like three of the derpy adolescentine chicks, for an absurdly astronomical amount (literally, just his supposed bids overstate activity on that website by a factor of more than 100). then he proceeded to... use them. guess what this usage consisted of ?<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> mircea_popescu: what do the 'winners' typically do with the 'win' ?<br />
<b>Framedragger</b> mircea_popescu: use them by observing how other people fuck? or making girls fuck so he can observe them? this is amusing<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> mno. you'd think at the very least he'd fuck them, but... no. he... masturbated them.</p>
<p><b>Framedragger</b> oh<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> all through this seeking my approval in the sense of trying to verify if im all that impressed. i... wasn't fucking impressed, because why the fuck would i be impressed with the male nurse.</p>
<p><b>Framedragger</b> kinda makes me sad<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> that's the problem with social hierarchies without social basis : they corrupt, fundamentally. the "leader" becomes the servant. i could have told mine to jump off the fucking balcony. she would have. he couldn't as much as take their fucking knickers off because omaygerd amarisho!!1<sup><a href="#footnote_10_70002" id="identifier_10_70002" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Amarisho is how the local gypsies say yellow. Since `safe words` aren't enough, they also have dedicated topping-from-the-bottom words now. 
Ideally in the near future they all just say `faker` and go home already. Hopefully they'll pronounce it `Argentina` for maximal justice.">xi</a></sup></p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> this is quite puzzling, if you aren't into public fuck ( as asciilifeform for instance is not ) WHY COME to such party.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> because they're into herding. and herding animals will go wherever there's herding safe spaces. which bdsm should be exactly NOT about, but hey, let common people get involved in things, the things will look like common people. back to the issue : they want to be paid to do what they were going to do anyway AND STRICTLY THAT.</p>
<p><b>Framedragger</b> "i heard bdsm is the trend nao, i'll go there". such a waste...<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> was showing up to this gig somehow 'expected', what, officemates in the dept. of derpland seekoority would make fun of d00d who didn't show ?<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> nah. it's mostly a collection of confused girlies and hopelessly dorky dudes. plus a few public servants (like the mentioned dude), plus a few occasionals who have been bringing their WIFE who will play their sunday slave once a few months. for years.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> roughly what sort of bag of money was needed to get in the door ?<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> i don't think money does it. they charge like 20 bux a head (yes, same for male or female, SAME IF ALONE etc!!1), but i think i'm on the list mostly because they're petriscared of me. it isn't open to the general public.</p>
<p><b>Framedragger</b> "no possibility of transcend", so to speak, following protocol. (re. "can you pay me to do what i'm used to doing when i get paid")<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> aha. that's the whole fucking point. liberals ? NIGGA WHAT ?!?! nobody is a liberal, the last one died in siberia. they're UBERconservative, so fucking self-protective it boggles anyone's mind.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> it isn't so different from ordinary concept of 'profession'. cobbler expects to be paid to make boots, not to sweep street. etc<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> none of (reddit clicking / forum derping / bdsming) is a profesion. they are supposed to be the opposite of professions : educations.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> well no. but same circuits are engaged.<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> wrongly.</p>
<p><b>Framedragger</b> i'm sure that making say decent artisan boots ain't fuckin' easy at all. (sure, working as a knob in a large factory is another thing - though i'd like to see redditards sweat many hours a day at factory and not call for mommy)<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> not a matter of easy or hard. a matter of separating vocation from avocation and your immortal soul from the fucking commerce spiel. also known as "have some fucking self respect" in some circles.</p>
<p><b>asciilifeform</b> most folx in usa working 'office job' are not doing anything considerably different, in aesthetic or even results, than reddit click. (and often there is considerable time on literal reddit etc. involved.)<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> which is why they're so lost.</p>
<p><b>Framedragger</b> i do see the general parallel, sure.<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> and american-style liberasty is simply the indignation of one set of redditors that the other is paid, while they - not<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> this isn't even so far off. "marxism" reconstructed as social media jealousy. "why myspace users make myspace gold which is worth three reddit gold ?!?!? UNFARE!"</p>
<p><b>Framedragger</b> heh. labour theory of value for reddit: i spend hour at reddit while you spend hour at reddit at work - why we unequal<br />
<b>mircea_popescu</b> goes right with the "western women be bitchez" logics of the alt-unfucked.<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> lulz from above fishwrap. mr.t's vp goes to theatre, is heckled ~by the actors~ </p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> hey, at least they didn't shoot him amirite.<br />
<b>asciilifeform</b> aha! that was my 1st thought. they nervously smoke in the corner, in light of <a href=http://trilema.com/2009/abraham-lincoln-tradator-de-neam-si-tara/#comment-119586>mr. booth</a>.</p>
<p><b>mircea_popescu</b> aha. see, booth WAS a liberal. these dorks are conservative. there's no such thing as liberal narcissism.</p>
<p>Now then - to understand each other : </p>
<ul>
<li>Liberalism is when I say nigger, or jew, and you are enticed by the usage to go check out <a href="http://btcbase.org/log/2016-11-15#1567911">what I mean by the terminology</a>. Conservatism is when you already have the value judgements ready-made. Do you assume you know what I mean better than I do, or don't you ?</li>
<p></p>
<li>Liberalism is when your experience of otherness is chiefly structured around the hope that it'll rescue you from your stale, untenable, unbearable interior life. Conservatism is when your experience of transcedence is chiefly composed of a promise it'll safeguard your interior life from the threats of alterity. Do you wish to be changed or preserved ?</li>
<p></p>
<li>Did it strike you as bizarre that in response to "Let's Make America Great Again" the best self-identified American Progressives could muster was "STFU, America Is Already Great" ? Progress understood as an effort to safeguard the values, gains and etcetera in front of the radical-conservative onslaught ?</li>
</ul>
<p>To be clear : you're not liberal ; and you're not progressive. Nor are you radical, Marxist, socialist, <em>impaciuitorist</em>, <em>samanatorist</em> or <em>liber-schimbist</em>.</p>
<p>You are simply petrified of change, dedicated to defending against change, always ready to cover up the defense so that perhaps the inferiority complex and <a href="http://trilema.com/2016/white-racism/#selection-257.0-257.57">burning self-hatred</a> that feed it somehow remain invisible to your own eyes.</p>
<p>Don't you think it's a tad strange that you could do anything you set your mind to ever since you were three years old, and yet you've never done anything, ever ? Isn't it odd that you enjoy sexual freedom your grandparents couldn't dream of and yet get laid less than them ? They enjoyed it when they did it. Do you ? Living in "the richest country in the world", in "the richest time in history" <em>really</em> makes your poverty stand out, doesn't it ? Money aside, do you know more than a Salinas teenager from 1895 ?<sup><a href="#footnote_11_70002" id="identifier_11_70002" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="

<blockquote><p>Dean College sits on a pretty, leafy campus in Franklin. A former two-year college, it began offering a selection of bachelor’s degrees only about a decade ago. It now accepts about 70 percent of the students who apply, the same rate as Fitchburg State University. Last year, Dean sent a financial aid award letter to an accepted student whose family, the federal government had determined, was so poor that the “expected family contribution” (EFC) to that student’s education was zero. The college awarded the student a Dean Presidential Grant of $17,000 and another nearly $13,000 in institutional, federal, and state grants, meaning that almost $30,000 of the bill was covered and never had to be paid back. Sounds great, right? Yes, until you look at the larger numbers on the award letter. The total cost of attendance — tuition, room, board, and fees — was $53,120. That meant the gap that this “zero-EFC” student had to cover through loans and other means in order to attend was more than $23,000. Per year. Over four years — and with only modest rises for inflation factored in — that total gap could be expected to climb to around $100,000, not counting future interest payments. That’s a ton of debt, particularly for a degree from a college whose median annual salary for alumni 10 years after enrolling is just $32,700.</p>
<p>To Dean’s credit, about half of its students who pursue a bachelor’s degree manage to graduate. Contrast that with Becker College in Worcester. On its website, Becker talks about being able to trace its roots back to two signers of the Declaration of Independence. It does not, however, mention what US Department of Education data from 2012-2013 show: namely, that just 16 percent of Becker’s students managed to graduate in four years, a number that inches up only to 24 percent when the time frame is extended to six years, the federal standard for completing a bachelor’s degree. In other words, 3 out every 4 students who enrolled as freshmen at Becker failed to graduate. Nor does the website mention that, after all grants and discounts are applied, a typical zero-EFC low-income student is required to come up with more than $25,000 every single year to cover the costs of attending Becker.</p>
<p>This seems to be the operating calculus at many small, private, nonselective or less selective colleges across the region, which routinely accept more than 60 percent of applicants. Consider the average annual “net” prices — after discounts and grants have been deducted — that these colleges are charging students coming from families whose total adjusted gross annual income is $30,000 or less. At a surprising number of colleges, this annual net price represents nearly all of that family’s total income for the year.</p></blockquote>
<p>That 100k is not merely collosal, it is also coming at the wrong time (there's a reason why saving a dime when you're 20 gives you a lot more than saving a dime when you're 50) and out the wrong end (you will repay that out of your <em>salary</em> which is <a href=http://btcbase.org/log/2016-11-07#1563469>the wrong degree of chumpatronicity</a>).</p>
<p>Think this through. <a href=http://trilema.com/2009/hai-sa-facem-o-socoteala/>Tandala</a> undertakes 100k of debt, and of the magical sort that can't ever be discharged. This will cost him a solid 5k a year in service alone. What exactly does he get in exchange ? He's not adding 5k of earning power, <a href=http://trilema.com/2014/a-practical-exercise-for-people-who-cant-afford-airfare/#selection-93.347-93.622>not even by a longshot</a>. On the contrary - he's building unreasonable expectations for himself, the sort that'll keep him from the more lucrative blue collar jobs, and he's setting the idiocy down in cement. Had he just built unreasonable expectations for himself, nurturing delusions about how he's really a writer/singer/songwriter/activist (seems to be fashionable these days) and thus too good to do my plumbing, hunger may have eventually cured him. But once he pours the cement of a large pile of debt into his cost structure there's no saving him, that extra 5k a year has to come from somewhere, and it won't be coming from me. Unlike him, I can't be coerced. Unlike him, I can't be deluded. </p>
<p>A college degree marks very strictly the difference between hunger-which-cures and hunger-which-kills, and if you permit your children to pursue one, you're permitting them to commit suicide. Quite literally, suicide. College kills more people than drunk driving - and you don't let the kids drive drunk, do you ?
