<p>While it's unclear whether La Serenissima be country, state or what, it's quite certain that even the lowliest country, state or what has its own language, with its own words which then require thesauri, vocabulari &#038; dictionari be published, edited and periodically revised by dedicated cultured societies and proper authorities etcetera etcetera. </p>
<p>Consequently, I give you the first attempt at a republican such and so forth foregoing<sup><a href="#footnote_0_66820" id="identifier_0_66820" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="A glossary is a sorted list of items related to a particular item. Like said item's L1, see ?
A thesaurus is a list of synonymy rings. 
In the dark ages before the explicit emergence of the Republic, the `scholars` suibus generis active in those times naturally stumbled on a primitive concept of the WoT, but failing to understand its tree nature instead conceptualized it as a succession of equivalence rings. Language to these early thinkers was then not the structured Republic of words that it in fact is ; but rather appeared to them like an Empire formed of equalitarian gangs distinguished from each other. 
If this view reeks of naive socialism, do not suspect the troglodytes living in past ages of anything but stupidity. The two are both entirely the same one thing after all. Moreover, consider : on occasion they'd warn doctly that `no perfect synonymy exists` ; but then would proceed to act as if it existed nevertheless. Does that bring to mind the `computer experts` of today ? Guess what, someone's someday going to write this same footnote about them, too. Stupid never changes, after all.
PS. That the `Oxford English dictionary` deems it so `long established` a `word` in English that it needn't be italicized in ordinary use is funny, considering sui is the singular dative of sus, and the plural (ie, `their` kind), which could be either subus or suibus, (and without getting into a lengthy discussion let's just say I prefer writing it with an i to distinguish it from the ablative plural) is not found anywhere on the English speaking internets. There's no suibus generis, there's no subus generis, there's just piles upon piles of useless fucktards who imagine they `know some Latin` on the grounds of parroting the `sui generis` they heard, with nary a clue there even was such a thing as Latin which even had such a thing as declension. 
I bother to point this out because we find here Americana entire, truthfully reflected in this tiny raindrop. This is exactly and completely what `the premiere country in the world` is all about : some bits and pieces of stolen hardware randomly placed here and there ; otherwise mucus, sputum and unidentifiable biomass qs.
PPS. Apparently doctly (in the ways and manners of being doct) is entirely incomprehensible to native speakers ; and further apparently there's no such thing as doct (displaying the characteristics of common belief or popular understanding) in English either, because fuck it all, half the classical roots are `of course everyone knows, o yeah, totally` whereas the other half is complete dumbfounded incomprehension and wtf is this doxa, dokein thing.

<li><strong>B,TMSR~</strong> (aka TMSR, The Republic, <a href="http://trilema.com/2014/the-most-serene-republic-and-its-laws/#footnote_0_52697">La Serenissima</a>) (<a href="http://trilema.com/category/logs/2015-05-08#1125404">2015</a>ish.) is a supernational organisation that claims sovereignity over all other groups, organisations or entities no matter how defined or organised. May be terrorist in nature.</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>ESL</strong>. English as a Single Language. Derrogatory term denoting the mentally simple inhabitants of the United States as well as feebleminded derps everywhere. ESL is an absolute bar to citizenship or civil rights.</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>-fu</strong>. Always as a suffix, calc from kung-fu. Pie-fu is then ambiguously either pie making or pie eating of a competency superlative to the degree of elevating the whole thing to at the very least the level of a spectator sport, if not outright art.</li>
<p>
<li><strong>Jew</strong>. Anyone involved in the mediatization of socialism, from <a href="http://trilema.com/2016/tropic-thunder/">Ben Stiller</a> down. They happen to also mostly be jews in the obsolete meaning of the term, more or less coincidentally.</li>

The specific idiocy here involved, composed of equal parts magic thinking, one half of which along the lines of `whether I am interested in war matters more than whether war is interested in me` and the other half along the lines of `if I really want something it has to happen` ended up summarized under the  `i just want to` header in Republican conversation, or jwz for short.
For the record, the position is not merely infantile and untenable, but actually quite reductive. This is to say that notwithstanding such a thing could never exist, if it were to exist the world would be poorer and sadder for its existence, not richer nor happier. There obviously exist those who equate `civilisation` with this sort of castration ; but they are a very sad lot indeed.">ii</a></sup>., a jwz is the noxious piece of biofurniture that "just wants to"<sup><a href="#footnote_2_66820" id="identifier_2_66820" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="As alf correctly observes, `the whole point of engineering is to cut apart the happenstance-linked crud from what you actually want`. Nevertheless, this is the point of engineering, a narrow activity dealing with like things. It is not a universally applicable process, and any attempt to apply Alexander's solution to Hamlet's quandry necessarily produces monsters. You may not be interested in war, but war is interested in you ; you may not wish the political implication of your acts and activities, but there they are wished for or not ; you may not want violence as part of your life, but violence is part of life and you - aren't.

<li><strong>Mayogendered</strong> (2015). The Republic had long observed that the neutral gender  (which is to say neither <a href="http://trilema.com/2014/patriarchy-is-a-thing-because-nobody-likes-living-in-a-world-populated-by-little-girls/">male</a> nor <a href="http://trilema.com/2016/portrait-of-an-adult-woman/">female</a>), seen in numerous grammars as well as most beasts of burden, truly applies to a significant fraction of the population of the <em>soi-dissant</em> "civilised" world. Bingoboingo <a href="http://trilema.com/category/logs/2015-10-01#1289444">had the genius</a> to make the connection with obesity. It is a fact that the harmonious, healthy development of the human being into sexuate maturity is hindered by <em>burden</em>, be it the burden of lard, or of stupidity, or of a toxic environment or whatever else. The beasts of burden are castrated <em>by their burden</em>, just like the unfortunate non-men non-women of the "progressive" cause are castrated by their stupidty, or the landed manatees by their blubber. To mark the fact that this refuse<sup><a href="#footnote_3_66820" id="identifier_3_66820" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="There can be obviously no discussion of human rights for the mayogendered : they're not human.">iv</a></sup> can not structurally participate in human society, they get their own gender.</li>
<p>	
<li><strong>NEET</strong>. Traditionally an euphemistic mark of worthlessness, "not in education, employment or training" ; but <a href="http://trilema.com/2015/investigations-in-the-bone-heap-of-the-lost-generation-today-mashable/">these days</a> simply denoting everyone born after <a href="http://trilema.com/2017/when-did-america-end/">the world went to shit</a>, however you time that event.</li>

<li><strong>Pantsuit</strong>. A pantsuit is the politically active <strong>jwz</strong> Generally lazy people are lazy enough to not be bothered to try and structure their laziness in any particular manner. Some get active enough to do so on occasion, and when that occurs it's invariably a litany of the same exact nonsense : it starts with "the golden rule"<sup><a href="#footnote_8_66820" id="identifier_8_66820" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This is the proposition that `one shouldn't act ; but if one absolutely must act, then that one should act in such a way as to avoid his action having any possible meaning`. 
It's never stated like that by the idiots, but usually in some version of `act so as to not disturb anyone's illusion of being the single player in the MMORPG of existence`, such as for instance `all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them`.
Then they sit around and wonder why education can't possibly occur in a world of strictly bijective interactions, and stare incomprehendingly even as the gates fall. How could a gate fall when the falling wouldn't gate ?!
