<p>What follows below is a translation of a Romanian article (<a href="http://www.princartier.com/romania-e-o-pizda-proasta-farmacie-sa-traiasca-pula/">Romania e o pizda proasta! Farmacie, sa traiasca… Pula!</a>) published in 2007 on the mysterious if meanwhile abandoned blog of one Nicolae Balcescu.</p>
<p>The identity of the author is altogether suspect. Plainly, the name is best known for a 19th century revolutionary bearing it, who formerly graced Romania's largest monetary denomination (and for a lengthy interval, 1952 - 1989). Given the general atmosphere and lyrical interests of the author, this isn't unlike a 1952 gangster's blog supposedly authored by "Benjamin Franklin". Yes, it's altogether not impossible a woman named whatever met a man named Whatever Franklin and at some point they decided to name their son Benjamin after his maternal granduncle or whatever. Nevertheless... <sup><a href="#footnote_0_70390" id="identifier_0_70390" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="In typical style, explained here notwithstanding it's lame in the hope some style may rub off on you, the foregoing was explained by me in Romanian as `it's the name of a neighbourhood park in a well to do Bucharest neighbourhood`. Get it ?">i</a></sup></p>
<p>The author <a href="http://trilema.com/2014/a-conceit-or-the-importance-of-blogging/">conceits</a> being about twenty. To me he always read like a well accomplished, cultured man in his fifties,</span> using much in the manner of Trilema deceitful simplicity to clothe abyssal truth otherwise entirely and by a very fat margin inaccessbile to <a href="http://trilema.com/2015/the-rabbi-and-the-ewe/">the herd</a>. In short, I recognize in this "Nicolae Balcescu" a frank equal<sup><a href="#footnote_1_70390" id="identifier_1_70390" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Yes, he's that fucking good.

hundreds of times, it is an accomplishment of Romanian usage that I can't even begin to dare describing. Suffice it to say that the reason I don't bring it up is because I don't generally trust the audience.
Because yes, Romanian is so powerful it sparks accidentally, and yes it is entirely possible the above just happened without intent and without art (which, you realise, makes it all the better), and yes I'm exposing myself to the same ridicule the original author takes insurance from in the very next sentence. 
I am rich now, and I am old now, and powerful and beloved and your mother had a stupid son that counts the word order at the wrong time so look what happens, so I assume the luxury of artlessness.

<p>To add amusement to the pile, it was observed by the eagle eye of one Trilema commenter<sup><a href="#footnote_3_70390" id="identifier_3_70390" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="It should be said that the Trilema commenter community constituted exactly 100% of Romanian-speaking thinking people at the time.">iv</a></sup> (and on the basis of data publised by Trilema as part of a different discussion<sup><a href="#footnote_4_70390" id="identifier_4_70390" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Because yes, at the time Trilema also constituted 100% of written content in the Romanian language - either it was there or it wasn't anything - and yes this 100% covered information the various ministries of the Romanian state were supposedly charged with publishing but failed to publish, a circumstance proved through the happenstance that when someone wanted to make an argument in a literary dispute, he relied on schooling data published also by Trilema. The Japanese conglomerates hope and dream, after a night of speed-fueled partying, to achieve the peaks of sociocultural domination Trilema achieved without much effort.
Living among rank imbeciles has its advantages.">v</a></sup>) that the kid may well exist <a href="http://trilema.com/2011/deci-de-revelion-acum-niste-ani/#comment-75104">as such</a>.</p>
<p>Be all that as it may, the text is <em>insanely</em> difficult to translate, partly because it deploys with a master's hand the Romanian tradition of мат, partly because English is a sort of <a href="http://trilema.com/2016/minigame-is-probably-never-going-to-support-python-3/">Python 3</a> these days (in the sense of having entirely lost any sort of contact with any kind of lived life, to dedicate itself entirely to dreams and aspirations of life). To illustrate the problems, let us merely consider the title. In the original it read :</p>
<blockquote><p>Romania e o pizda proasta! Farmacie, sa traiasca… Pula!</p></blockquote>
<p>Romania is clearly enough denoting the country. Not the state ; and not the population. Clear enough yet ? </p>
<p>Proasta means stupid now, but historically meant poor quality, mean (in the original sense, "of mean extraction"). In the slang he abundantly uses however it means just about "attached woman", ie, no longer a virgin and <em>no longer free</em>. If you went around saying "the dumbass" about every attached girl you see, including in discussions with her attachment etcetera, you'd be living on the same edge this dude lives on, over there between Viilor and Trafic Greu (now Progresul, ofcoars<sup><a href="#footnote_5_70390" id="identifier_5_70390" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="When one manages to subvert City Hall to the degree the street planning commission augmentatively contributes to one's literary production you know you're looking at a Master, yes ?">vi</a></sup>.)</p>
<p>Pizda, contrary to what you'd expect on etymological basis, is not a derrogatory. Yes it means "cunt" in Romanian, but in denotative usage it simply makes known the user's belief that the woman in question is healthy<sup><a href="#footnote_6_70390" id="identifier_6_70390" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="See the discussion about how it was socially unacceptable for a healthy woman to not put out, in that culture.">vii</a></sup> and functional. </p>
<p>So then, what do we make of this, "Romania is a huswife" ? Not much of a translation is it ? Then "Pharmacy" is the name of his friend, and then <em>Pula!</em> is not Cock! nor Dick! because both these castrated constructions mostly serve to apologize to women, to "womansplain" as they'd cheekily put it. No, Fuckstick no less, the Pula! there is that thing you worship while you live and eventually die by, not some sort of wee-wee or pee-pee. It is a tool of aggression, and the only reason it's not aggressing you up the butt and to death right now is because you spend every waking hour pandering to it, so much so that it paternally allows you to continue to exist in your current shape rather than split in two or more halves. Truth.</p>

<p>I come in and I go "Pharmacy! They're gonna put up a Christmas tree as big as my dick over at Unirea, what the splooge do we do ballsac, what the splo oge do we do ?" The man lifts his finger on a punkish background and smiles like a cocksucking pedophile.</p>
