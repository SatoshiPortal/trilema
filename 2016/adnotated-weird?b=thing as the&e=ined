<p>Mah girlz are out clubbing, and here I sit, <a href="http://trilema.com/2010/rabinul-si-oaia/">an old man</a> on the top floor of his <a href="http://trilema.com/2015/oracle-sunday-on-eulora/">Tower of Song</a>. I wouldn't say I'm bored, exactly, but I'm certainly disinterested. From way up here all the inept scribblings of mere mortals appear equally childish, which is why and wherefore we'll be reviewing the work of one David Lane<sup><a href="#footnote_0_70096" id="identifier_0_70096" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Something called 88 Precepts.">i</a></sup> tonight rather than that of I don't know what other indistinguishable, equivalent<sup><a href="#footnote_1_70096" id="identifier_1_70096" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Showing the supposed substantial difference between David Lane and whatever pinnacle of current fashion is left as an open exercise to the Elliots in attendance.">ii</a></sup> "luminaries" <a href="http://trilema.com/2013/queers/#selection-79.164-79.186">in their own mind</a>. Besides, this one's brief.</p>
<blockquote><p>Until the White race realizes that there is only one source from which we can ascertain lasting truths, there will never be peace or stability on this earth. In the immutable Laws of Nature are the keys to life, order, and understanding. The words of men, even those which some consider "inspired" are subject to the translations, vocabulary, additions, subtractions, and distortions of fallible mortals. </p></blockquote>
<p>The fundamental problem with the fellow's [mis]understanding of his environment, be that environment represented as "Nature" (traditionally reserved for ontology and phenomena) or "text" (traditionally used to denote gnoseology, especially by smug idiots with ridiculous facial hair, belabouring under the delusional notion that speaking of text is somehow better than speaking of nature) is politely, subduedly, modestly laid open before us the moment he opens his mouth. Twice.</p>
<p>How exactly is "the White race" to understand something ? I can train a dog. Probably so can you. How will you train <em>dogs</em> ? The canine race ? What does it mean, for the canine race to "understand something" ? Until the Culicidae race<sup><a href="#footnote_2_70096" id="identifier_2_70096" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="For once that term's used properly, don't get used to it, you won't soon see it again.">iii</a></sup> understands they could <a href="http://trilema.com/forum-logs-for-16-nov-2016#2194291">just as well feed on plant</a>, there's no future for it. So ?</p>
<p>But leave that, and consider <a href="http://trilema.com/forum-logs-for-27-sep-2016#2175696">the simple bootstrapping problem</a>. How are you going to make keys ? How is "nature", however defined, supposed to make these wunderbar keys to "life, order and everything spice" ? </p>
<p>Yes, I understand that it'd be great if it did, just like it'd be great if "women" in the abstract plural finally saw what a nice guy whatever beta actually is and gave him the time of day. I understand it's very tempting to apply one's meager powers and inadequate self to "solving" "<a href="http://trilema.com/2014/agency-and-other-notes/#selection-31.147-31.185">big</a>" problems, especially of the entirely hallucinated kind. They provide a welcome distraction from constant, daily failure to tackle much simpler, triter problems a majority of living beings have solved today, and yesterday, and the day before that and the day before that one too.</p>
<p>Sadly, in the world-as-it-is, and in stark contrast to the-world-as-it-could-be-conveniently-misrepresented, there is no such <span style="background-color:#d3d3d3" id="select">thing as the keys, or the white race, or collective-noun-understanding. Who're you and what we, <a href="http://trilema.com/2016/honor-societies-vs-respect-societies-or-how-the-disaster-of-commons-sunk-the-western-world/#comment-119862">she says</a>. She has a point.</p>
<blockquote><p>Therefore, every writing or influence, ancient or modern, must be strained</span> through the test of conformity to Natural Law. The White Peoples of the earth must collectively understand that they are equally subject to the iron-hard Laws of Nature with every other creature of the Universe, or they will not secure peace, safety, nor even their existence. The world is in flames because Races, Sub-races, Nations, and Cultures are being forced to violate their own Nature-ordained instincts for self-preservation. Many men of good will, but little understanding, are struggling against symptoms which are the result of disobedience to Natural Law. </p></blockquote>
<p>We will generously nod at the banal beads on the narrative thread while glossing over the gaping horror that is the proposed classification. We could rather have the fellow rigorously define these "Sub-races", these nations and these cultures<sup><a href="#footnote_3_70096" id="identifier_3_70096" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="No, there is no American nation, and if there were it would pointedly not inhabit the North of that continent. And I hope for your sake you mean something with stones and extinct for millenia if you're discussing culture in that part of the world.">iv</a></sup>, but it'd end the exercise prematurely.</p>
<blockquote><p>As is the Nature of Man, most take narrow, provincial stances predicated on views formed by immediate environment, current circumstances, and conditioned dogma. This is encouraged by that powerful and ruthless Tribe which has controlled the affairs of the world for untold centuries by exploiting Man's most base instincts. Conflict among and between the unenlightened serves as their mask and shield. A deeper understanding of the Fundamental Laws that govern the affairs of Men is necessary if we are to save civilization from its usurious executioners. The following are not intended to provide a detailed system of government, but as PRECEPTS which, when understood, will benefit and preserve a People as individuals and as a Nation. </p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, most people see the world up to their nose ; yes the elite however defined survives from the disunion of the mass - this is an observation of the acuity of pointing out that all pyramids are narrower at the top and widest at the base ; yes "the following aren't intended as &lt;functional description> but as &lt;magic label>" is a trivial trick of the deliberately irresponsible - he wasn't <em>saying</em>, he was just, you know, saying. Bla bla etcetera.</p>
<blockquote><p>1. Any religion or teaching which denies the Natural Laws of the Universe is false. </p></blockquote>
<p>The Smith-ism is strong with this one. At least have the common decency to quote "לא יהיה לך אלהים אחרים על פני" correctly. The kikes came up with this trick, might as well give them credit for it, neh ?</p>
<blockquote><p>2. Whatever Peoples perception of God, or Gods, or the motive Force of the Universe might be, they can hardly deny that Nature's Law are the work of, and therefore the intent of, that Force. </p></blockquote>
<p>We can deny that work is therefore intent ; and if you ever grow up enough to be worshipped by slaves, you will soon discover that as pure their heart may be, and as honest their intention may be, and as skilled they may be, nevertheless their work and their intent will diverge. But even if you do not so discover : they will deny it, along with me. No therefore.</p>
<blockquote><p>3. God and religion are distinct, separate and often conflicting concepts. Nature evidences the divine plan, for the natural world is the work of the force or the intelligence men call God. Religion is the creation of mortals, therefore predestined to fallibility. Religion may preserve or destroy a People, depending on the structure given by its progenitors, the motives of its agents and the vagaries of historical circumstances. </p></blockquote>
<p>The word "intelligence" has a meaning ; it is binding even on those not intelligent enough to <a href="http://trilema.com/2015/the-genetics-of-intelligence/">grasp it</a>. That you see planning in the flow of entalpy has little bearing - throwing a coin a dozen times will "evidence" the coin plan, to fall however many times on whichever side exactly as it did - and if you threw a different one, it'd have evidenced a different plan. Hurr.</p>
<p>In any case, there's no known instance of religion having destroyed a people ; or for that matter preserved it. If your definition of people is informed by their extant religion, such as in the case of the nutty Romanians, or for that matter Jews, then yes "the religion saved them". It didn't, of course, save all the ones it didn't save - but it's okay, those weren't "real" Romanians, or for that matter <a href="http://trilema.com/2012/in-general-evreii-trec-drept-oameni-destepti/#selection-41.0-43.0">Jews</a>, by the silly definition employed. And if on the contrary, your definition of people stands in opposition to their extant religion, then holy smokes watch religion destroy "the" people. </p>
<blockquote><p>4. The truest form of prayer is communion with Nature. </p></blockquote>
<p>Da fuck is that. Fucking mossy treestumps ? Swimming in algal blooms ? Eating a lot of shrimp ?</p>
<blockquote><p>It is not vocal. </p></blockquote>
<p>And why not ? And how do we know ? Where's it written on Nature's key, this strange new learning ? </p>
<p>By the way, is it anal ?</p>
<blockquote><p>Go to a lonely spot, if possible a mountaintop, on a clear, star-lit night, ponder the majesty and order of the infinite macrocosm. Then consider the intricacies of the equally infinite microcosm.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem with self-administered meditation (as any serious religion will tell you - on the basis of bitter experience no less) is that <a href="http://btcbase.org/log/2016-09-27#1549468">it unhinges the mind</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p>Understand that you are on the one hand inconsequential beyond comprehension in the size of things, and on the other hand, you are potentially valuable beyond comprehension as a link in destiny's chain. There you begin to understand how pride and self can co-exist with respect and reverence. There we find harmony with Nature and with harmony comes strength, peace and certainty. </p></blockquote>
<p>Myeah. And you also become that more likely to buy overpriced gold coins.</p>
<blockquote><p>5. Secular power systems protect and promote religions, which teach of an after-life. Thus, people are taught to abandon defenses against the predators of this life.</p></blockquote>
<p>The irony of this being a very thinly veiled wanna-be religion apparently escapes the author.</p>
<blockquote><p>6. History, both secular and religious, is a fable conceived in self-serving deceit and promulgated by those who perceive benefits. </p></blockquote>
<p>Rochester, of course, said it so very much better. As well as others. But whatever.</p>
<blockquote><p>7. Religion in its most beneficial form is the symbology of a People and their culture. A multiracial religion destroys the senses of uniqueness, exclusivity and value necessary to the survival of a race. </p></blockquote>
<p>We're discussing mosts without having even defined the terms, let alone come up with any sort of measuring stick. This bodes well. </p>
<p>What is a "symbology" in this context ? Semiotics aka symbology in the common, term-of-art usage, is merely the study of signs and symbols. That meaning does not seem to be supported by the text, leaving us afloat in literary lalaland. </p>
<p>How could we interpret the "sense of special snowflake ... necessary for survival" in terms that don't readily reduce to an inferiority complex ? Why does Elliot desperately need to feel special or else temper tantrum (~= death, in the narcissist mind) ?</p>
<blockquote><p>8. What men call the super natural is actually the natural not yet understood or revealed. </p></blockquote>
<p>Let's try an exercise in this vein. Consider at time t a box displaying a cat and running a Windows Vista 7 NT XT (tm) (R) operating system. (This, by the way, is totally my idea which I haven't schroeded from Stollingen.) At a point of time t', so that t' - t > 0, the cat may or may not still be displayed. The knowledge of whether the cat will or will not be displayed at t' is in point of fact something the mere passage of time will resolve. The knowledge of how to find at time t whether the cat will display at time t' or not however... that's supernartural!</p>
<p>Yes as time goes by all Windows boxes fail, that much is always revealed. Yet as time goes on and on and on and ON the secret of how to make Windows boxes not fail does not seem willing to divulge itself already. I suppose the solution is to wait more, right ? Someone call Turing and tell him the good news (his excited response will eventually be revealed, through the passage of sufficient time).</p>
<blockquote><p>9. A proliferation of laws with the resultant loss of freedom is a sign of, and directly proportional to, spiritual sickness in a Nation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, it is a sign and symptom of increased density (review the <a href="http://trilema.com/2012/anonimity-or-the-urban-versus-rural-dispute/">urban/rural dispute</a>). If this is a sickness so be it, but it'd behoove one to make the relation explicit.</p>
<blockquote><p>10. If a Nation is devoid of spiritual health and moral character, then government and unprincipled men will fill the vacancy. Therefore, freedom prospers in moral values and tyranny thrives in moral decay. </p></blockquote>
<p>Also in Principled News today, all these cups I call cups are cups whereas all those pots I call pots are pots. The problems of my kitchen are well solved, especially for as long as the clubbing kittens do the cooking and cleaning and are also ready to fawn over my sparse contributions whenever I feel so inclined to contribute.</p>
<p>It's not a bad system - but it does depend on slave labour.</p>
<blockquote><p>11. Truth requires little explanation. Therefore, beware of verbose doctrines. The great principles are revealed in brevity. </p></blockquote>
<p>Certainly does make one wonder why the ten commandments multiplied 8.8 fold.</p>
<blockquote><p>12. Truth does not fear investigation. </p></blockquote>
<p>And virgins do not fear a good dose of the clap. <em>Laissez.</em></p>
<blockquote><p>13. Unfounded belief is pitfall. A People who do not check the validity and effect of their beliefs with reason will suffer or perish. </p></blockquote>
<p>The only problem with this being that the effects can not be checked with reason. Which is why - <a href="http://trilema.com/2015/causes-and-purposes/">causes, not purposes</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>14. In accord with Nature's Laws, nothing is more right than the preservation of ones own race. </p></blockquote>
<p>How could we check this claim ? As unfounded belief is the clap and truth does not fear virgins or somesuch salad, it'd be upon us to investigate the pitfall, neh ? How would we go about it ?</p>
<p>For instance - would you say that proper pickles are more right than auricular hygiene ? What do you deem preferable, suppose I brought before you two girls, identical in all respects, both restraining the modest gaze of their wide and lovely eyes, like pearls, both companions of equal age, splendid, voluptuous, non-menstruating nor urinating nor defecating and childfree (or at your option able to bring to term within the hour), with bodies unaffected by pregnancy or breastfeeding, each 60 cubits tall, transparent to the marrow of their bones both, eternally young and hairless except for the eyebrows and the head, except one made great pickles and the other washed her ears - which would you choose ? But bear in mind you are to choose in accord with Nature's Law, okay ?</p>
<p>How does this blessed law of sorting over the set of rights work, because the only Nature's Law I am familiar with from practice in the field is the one that makes whatever you didn't choose appear righter the moment you chose something.</p>
<blockquote><p>15. No greater motivating force exists than the certain conviction that one is right. </p></blockquote>
<p>This is so much dross. I have seen this supposed strong motivation go to shit so often it's not worth the count. </p>
<p>The first motivator is fear. The second motivator is hunger. The third motivator is vanity, with greed a close fourth. Righteousness motivates strictly the idle and immature, those who are not hungry nor know what hunger is, those who don't clearly recall what a good beating is, the adolescentine "elite" of self-appointment just <a href="http://trilema.com/2014/the-idea-for-a-great-film/#selection-81.0-81.481">begging for a good fuck</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>16. Discernment is a sign of a healthy People. In a sick or dying nation, civilization, culture or race, substance is abandoned in favor of appearance. </p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, yes, superficiality as mark of decay. I've seen it said better.</p>
<blockquote><p>17. Discernment includes the ability to recognize the difference between belief and demonstrable reality. </p></blockquote>
<p>Oh nigga... puhleaze. Discern the difference between belief and demonstrable reality in physics, it'll be a good start. What are we demonstrating today, that all the major problems are resolved and physics is a closed field ? Oh wait, that was 1896 sorry, my bad.</p>
<p>Nuts.</p>
<blockquote><p>18. There exists no such thing as rights or privileges under the Laws of Nature. The deer being stalked by a hungry lion has no right to life. However, he may purchase life by obedience to nature ordained instincts for vigilance and flight. Similarly, men have no rights to life, liberty or happiness. These circumstances may be purchased by oneself, by ones family, by ones tribe or by ones ancestors, but they are nonetheless purchases and are not rights. Furthermore, the value of these purchases can only be maintained through vigilance and obedience to Natural Law. </p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, rights are conventional in nature.</p>
<blockquote><p>19. A people who are not convinced of their uniqueness and value will perish. </p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, all people will perish. So will all specified sets of concrete items. This is a fundamental property of ontology.</p>
<blockquote><p>20. The White race has suffered invasions and brutality from Africa and Asia for thousands of years. For example, Attila and the Asiatic Huns who invaded Europe in the 5th century, raping, plundering and killing from the Alps to the Baltic and the Caspian Seas. This scenario was repeated by the Mongols of Genghis Khan 800 years later.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, fuck them for not having purchased security and whatever with bigger dicks or how did it go.</p>
<blockquote><p>(Note here that the American Indians are not Native Americans, but are racially Mongolians.)
</p></blockquote>
<p>Not only that, but they came in their piddly pirogues and landed in Caerdydd.</p>
<blockquote><p>In the 8th century, hundreds of years before Negroes were brought to America, the North African Moors of mixed racial background invaded and conquered Portugal, Spain and part of France.</p></blockquote>
<p>And in the 1st century a Julian with brown hair and brown eyes<sup><a href="#footnote_4_70096" id="identifier_4_70096" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Suetonius, unlike the various other consensus-derps, actually saw the man.">v</a></sup> conquered the fair haired Gauls through burning a bunch of them alive and other niceties. For my own discernment, who's the nigger in <em>de</em> Bello Gallico ?</p>
<blockquote><p>So, the attempted guilttrip placed on the White race by civilizations executioners is invalid under both historical circumstance and the Natural Law which denies inter-species compassion. The fact is, all races have benefited immeasurably from the creative genius of the Aryan People. </p></blockquote>
<p>Oh I'm sorry, the bad sayings are invalid. Ne-ner.</p>
<blockquote><p>21. People who allow others not of their race to live among them will perish, because the inevitable result of a racial integration is racial inter-breeding which destroys the characteristics and existence of a race. Forced integration is deliberate and malicious genocide, particularly for a People like the White race, who are now a small minority in the world. </p></blockquote>
<p>This is readily falsified experimentally. Take the Sicilians, who are aptly described by <a href="http://trilema.com/2013/true-romance-tarantino-cut/">that old cop</a> :</p>
<blockquote><p>Clifford Worley: You're Sicilian, huh?<br />
Coccotti: Yeah, Sicilian.</p>
<p>Clifford Worley: Ya know, I read a lot. Especially about things... about history. I find that shit fascinating. Here's a fact I don't know whether you know or not. Sicilians were spawned by niggers.<br />
Coccotti: [He does a double take] Come again?</p>
<p>Clifford Worley: It's a fact. Yeah. You see, uh, Sicilians have, uh, black blood pumpin' through their hearts. Hey, no, if eh, if eh, if you don't believe me, uh, you can look it up. Hundreds and hundreds of years ago, uh, you see, uh, the Moors conquered Sicily. And the Moors are niggers.<br />
Coccotti: Yes...</p>
<p>Clifford Worley: So you see, way back then, uh, Sicilians were like, uh, wops from Northern Italy. Ah, they all had blonde hair and blue eyes, but, uh, well, then the Moors moved in there, and uh, well, they changed the whole country. They did so much fuckin' with Sicilian women, huh? That they changed the whole bloodline forever. That's why blonde hair and blue eyes became black hair and dark skin. You know, it's absolutely amazing to me to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, that, uh, that Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. Now this...</p>
<p>[Coccotti busts out laughing]</p>
<p>Clifford Worley: No, I'm, no, I'm quoting... history. It's written. It's a fact, it's written.<br />
Coccotti: [laughing] I love this guy.</p>
<p>Clifford Worley: Your ancestors are niggers. Uh-huh.</p>
<p>[Starts laughing, too]</p>
<p>Clifford Worley: Hey. Yeah. And, and your great-great-great-great grandmother fucked a nigger, ho, ho, yeah, and she had a half-nigger kid... now, if that's a fact, tell me, am I lying? 'Cause you, you're part eggplant.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Tarantino's research is sound ; and yet it's indisputable the Sicilians are more nationally cohesive (generally, to their detriment) than the Italians further North. In fact, the margins of that country show a lot more national cohesion than the center (Milan's exactly the same way) <em>because</em> of exposure. </p>
<p>So no, the premise is false : it's not that people who allow others not of their race to live among them will perish ; it's that national identity does not even form if the other is not present.</p>
<blockquote><p>22. In the final analysis, a race or species is not judged superior or inferior by its accomplishments, but by its will and ability to survive. </p></blockquote>
<p>Except if the race goes to one of those retarded TV shows, then it'll be judged on its ability to dance.</p>
<blockquote><p>23. Political, economic, and religious systems may be destroyed and resurrected by men, but the death of a race is eternal. </p></blockquote>
<p>Well in that case the Aryan thing is a lost cause, they died out fifteen or so centuries ago.<sup><a href="#footnote_5_70096" id="identifier_5_70096" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Fact check : the Aryans are a people who invaded Northern India about the time Caesar was taking Gaul, and drove out the local troglodytes then indigenous. The Greeks did something very similar at about the same time, there's a migratory period in the last millenium BC that was reported by the Egyptians as well as others. 
These movements have exactly nothing to do with the poor scholarship of de Gobineau &#038; friends, which then created the imaginary categories the Nazis deployed, and which in turn have exactly nothing to do with the HFCS guzzling contemporaneous population.
There's no less than four distinct groups haphazardly mishmashed here. The original Aryans happened in Northern India sometime around the start of the common era. Some different, misidentified Aryans were imagined by a French aristocrat. These 2nd Aryans existed very much in the exact same sense the Hobbits existed. They were then appropriated by the Nazi state, creating a third kind of Aryans, very much unrelated to either of the original two. Fifty or so years after the end of the endless Reich, a fourth kind of `Aryans` was invented by people living on a different continent. 
This `Aryan` business spans three millenia and three continents, and the gaps are larger than the contiguities by a degree of magnitude, in places two.">vi</a></sup></p>
<blockquote><p>24. No race of People can indefinitely continue their existence without territorial imperatives in which to propagate, protect, and promote their own kind. </p></blockquote>
<p>How did the Jews manage ? </p>
<p>No, the question's <a href="http://trilema.com/2013/the-dead-jew-and-the-raped-girl/">not idle</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>25. A People without a culture exclusively their own will perish. </p></blockquote>
<p>This is altogether dubious. Culture's a whore, without exception known to letters, and so... what's one mean by "own" ?</p>
<blockquote><p>26. Nature has put a certain antipathy between races and species to preserve the individuality and existence of each. Violation of the territorial imperative necessary to preserve that antipathy leads to either conflict or mongrelization. </p></blockquote>
<p>This is altogether a dubious proposition. Historical slave trade shows strong preference for white females in the Middle East throughout ten or fifteen centuries, which is how the first non-slave Ottoman consort came to be. Overweight sexually shy males from North America show significant preference for Asian females (of a different kind - verbal rather than factual). Exogamy as a cultural practice indicates that on the contrary, it's likely a slight preference for outsiders may be the norm in humans. Certainly the females show preference outside the group, which is why all Jewish girls are such terrible whores to the utter desperation of their parents.</p>
<p>What, you though you're the only ones that have problems ?</p>
<blockquote><p>27. It is not constructive to hate those of other races, or even those of mixed races. But a separation must be maintained for the survival of one's own race.  </p></blockquote>
<p>This may be true, inasmuch as the best way to get a girl going is for the parents to forbid it.</p>
<blockquote><p>One must, however, hate with a pure and perfect hatred those of one's own race who commit treason against one's own kind and against the nations of one's own kind. One must hate with perfect hatred all those People or practices which destroy one's People, one's culture, or the racial exclusiveness of one's territorial imperative. </p></blockquote>
<p>If only. Asking for the general population to produce anything pure and perfect is ludicrous a notion enough - but hatred of all things ? The most expensive, rare and difficult to come by commodity known in nature ? Gawds have mercy, ask for things that can be delivered perfect and pure, such as farts that alter the color of the Sun or working computing software. Not hate, that's impossible.</p>
<blockquote><p>28. The concept of a multi-racial society violates every Natural Law for species preservation. </p></blockquote>
<p>Are these Natural Law written somewhere ? How many does every evaluate to in this context ?</p>

The Greeks did something very similar at about the same time, there's a migratory period in the last millenium BC that was reported by <a href="http://btcbase.org/log/2016-06-19#1484958">the Egyptians</a> as well as others. </p>
<p>These movements have exactly nothing to do with the poor scholarship of de Gobineau &#038; friends, which then created the imaginary categories the Nazis deployed, and which in turn have exactly nothing to do with the HFCS guzzling contemporaneous population.</p>
<p>There's no less than <em>four</em> distinct groups haphazardly mishmashed here. The original Aryans happened in Northern India sometime around the start of the common era. Some different, misidentified Aryans were <em>imagined</em> by a French aristocrat. These 2nd Aryans existed very much in the exact same sense the Hobbits existed. They were then appropriated by the Nazi state, creating a third kind of Aryans, very much unrelated to either of the original two. Fifty or so years after the end of the endless Reich, a fourth kind of "Aryans" was invented by people living on a different continent. </p>
<p>This "Aryan" business spans three millenia and three continents, and the gaps are larger than the contiguities by a degree of magnitude, in places two. [<a href="#identifier_5_70096" class="footnote-link footnote-back-link">&#8617;</a>]</li></ol>
