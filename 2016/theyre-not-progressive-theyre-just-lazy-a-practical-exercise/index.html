In other words - you'll be a scientist, rather than a <a href="http://trilema.com/2016/the-human-latrine-pig/">human latrine pig</a><sup><a href="#footnote_5_69944" id="identifier_5_69944" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="人彘 if you prefer the classical Chinese notation.
Speaking of which - I wonder what will happen now, since the US is practically a Chinese colony.
I wonder what will happen to you.">vi</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Looking through that list, past the strange capitalisation conventions and approximate use of words, we'll take down the actual numeric claims. </p>
<p>Sticking to the millions, that's 13 + 9 + .1 + 12 + 10 + 7 + .087 + 3 + 6 = 60.187, the figure representing aggregate millions of "members", "facebook and twitter fans", "people", "real people", "social members", "US &#038; EU facebook twitter followers", "followers ASAP"<sup><a href="#footnote_6_69944" id="identifier_6_69944" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I'm guessing this is like the USDA amirite?">vii</a></sup>, "world wide"s and "social people" - in a word, nothings, but certainly enough of them. </p>
<p>Since the mean of our "data series"<sup><a href="#footnote_7_69944" id="identifier_7_69944" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Hey, everything can be a data series, right ? That's how progressive Earth science works!">viii</a></sup> is 6.687444444 (millions of ~) we can therefore calculate our whole set to be worth 113.686555548, that is to say one hundred and thirteen million six hundred and eighty six thousand five hundred and fifty-five... people and five hundred and forty-eight... thousandths of a people. Because why the hell not, right ? IT'S NUMBERS!</p>
<p>Numbers enough to reverse the US presidential election results 169 times and change.<sup><a href="#footnote_8_69944" id="identifier_8_69944" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="113.686555548 / (61.047207 - 60.375961) = 169.366455142.

Be sure to also ask about `alliance of demographic trends` since you're there, they'll tell you all about it.">ix</a></sup> How could one resist such a glorious amount of numbers ?!</p>
<p>But wait, there's more! Since the median is 7, it then follows that our "confidence interval" is 0.56 (%) <sup><a href="#footnote_9_69944" id="identifier_9_69944" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="√(7−6.687444444) = 0.559066683.

Can you actually thread this needle ? Let me hear you.
Let me hear you, and know that your silence on this topic is of the exact substance of the silence on that other topic, and on all the other important topics - it creates upon you an obligation. It creates upon you the obligation to change your mind, and to cast out the things of childhood, and to fucking grow up already.">xi</a></sup> Hey - only racists don't believe. ITS SCIENCE! WITH NUMBERS! AND DATA!</p>
<p>Anyway, I set out the following task for these entrepreneurial youth of fiverr : </p>
<blockquote><p>1. Go to trilema.com<br />
2. You will be shown a random article. Keep reloading trilema.com until you hit on an article you like / want to promote / fits your audience.<br />
3. Promote the article you chose - !by url! Right click the title to get the article url. </p>
<p>DO NOT simply promote the root  domain (trilema.com), you will get negative rating. Select an article you like, promote that specifically. Let me know which article you chose.</p>
<p>That's all.</p></blockquote>
<p>In most jurisdictions 5 dollars still pays for 20 minutes of the lowliest dork's time (by imperial fiat), which is just about how long it takes me to write one of my articles (no, not this one - this one is with NUMBERS), and so the proposition on the table was, "go to trilema.com, click refresh and skimread a few times, then scribble a few words in your own unmistakable style and be done with it". Hey, it beats flipping burgers - not that anyone would let these nitwits anywhere near the comparatively dangerous (for them) hot stove. Let them sit on the computer all day, it's safer. Not like anyone would take them seriously there or anything.</p>
<p>All this happened yesterday, about this time. Today, roughly 24 hours later, I have a whole pile of results already in!</p>
<p>Can you guess what they are ?</p>
<p>Six of the seventeen cancelled outright. Do you wonder why ? </p>
<p>Because "this isn't what they do". </p>
<p>You may be excused from having formed a contrary opinion on the basis of reading their offerings. You may be excused from thinking they're not in any position to argue, seeing how, as the old adage went, "baby, if you're naked on the set, you're taking the cock" - that's all bias and the patriarchy speaking through you. The fact remains that these fine gents and ladies of the new generation have decided what they'll do is lazily skim for an url, put that url in the box, click the button <em>and no more</em>. <strong>NO MORE!</strong> Nothing else, no matter what, they're masters of their destinies and kings/queens of their imaginary castles, and they'll do what they do - if it suits you fine and if not ... whatever!</p>
<p>But wait - there's more. I also received no less than four completions! Guess what they did ? </p>
<p>O yeah, that's right - they skimread even more acutely than the other six, fished out trilema.com, "promoted" that, and expect to be paid. What do you mean "it says don't do exactly that, right there!" Too much text. They were tricked. Please don't focus more on abstract concepts<sup><a href="#footnote_11_69944" id="identifier_11_69944" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Such as you know, the actual job description.">xii</a></sup> rather than the people themselves</a>! What are you, some kind of <a href="http://trilema.com/2014/the-definitive-tract-on-sociopathy/#selection-71.369-71.434">sociopath</a> ?! They did the "work" (as they define it - and why shouldn't <em>they</em> get to define it ?<sup><a href="#footnote_12_69944" id="identifier_12_69944" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="No, seriously, the expectation of the lazy `progressive` that zher's the one to define zher's own work (and preferably also the scoring criteria for said work) is so deeply ingrained as to beggar belief. Try testing it sometime.">xiii</a></sup>), they should be paid!</p>
<p>I rejected the four "completions" with a terse </p>
<blockquote><p>Read the instructions and re-do.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of them responded by cancelling the project. Now you have the context to deeply comprehend Stan's point about <a href="http://trilema.com/forum-logs-for-13-nov-2016#2192723">amoeba</a>. Yes, it's this bad - as if language were a foreign language. No, I don't mean as if <em>English</em> were a foreign language. I mean language, in general and outright, altogether. The ability to think, the simple intuition that there is a relation between "stop or I'll shoot" and the blood-oozing hole in its side is missing. The relation between phenomena and symbols is gone. They are not people, that's what I mean by it - they'll go where the gradient seems to be, and if it turns out not to be, a well. A well! That's it!</p>
<p>Another one of them responded in the most amusing fashion : </p>
<blockquote><p>goodworkservice: Hello friend how can i help you? Cheers Jase.</p></blockquote>
<p>This protozoan is actually virulent : it can express the "friend" protein structure that sometimes works to open up the cell membrane. "Jase" has no idea what it is, or how it works, or even what a jase is, but no matter - sometimes it works. And if sometimes it works, then that's all Jase needs, because look up reproductive strategies, r/K selection etc. </p>
<p>Supposedly I'm going to sit there and <em>explain</em>. Because why ? Because Jase's entire life there was an adult available (paid by the state with borrowed money) to "explain" things to him ? <em>This</em> is what your miseducation system has produced. Do kids perform better when there's no beatings as part of the public schooling ? <em>Really ?</em></p>
<p>Who knows, maybe all I <em>really</em> wanted is for someone to talk to, and Jase could just plug me into an Eliza for half an hour ? Maybe he makes the fiver then ? Worth a shot! And besides - it works for the phone companies, doesn't it ? And for the banks ? And for the "that is our policy" idiots everywhere ? Why shouldn't it work for Jase, what, he can't have "good customer service" and phonelines with music that doesn't require licenses playing in the background ? Down with the patriarchy! </p>
<p>The other two of the four are still thinking about it, but I suspect it'll go either one way or the other. Which... oh, you thought we were done ? We aren't fucking done, not by a damn sight. Consider this jewel : </p>

<p>She will... write. Tweets. This is what she will do, in her mind, she will write. Tweets. </p>
<p>You can tell that she's the only old one<sup><a href="#footnote_13_69944" id="identifier_13_69944" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Ie, 40+ rather than 20-something.">xiv</a></sup> in the lot, because vague remnants of human civilisation still seem to adhere, even if the bulk of the body has thoroughly undergone amoebatic transformation. So, to honor those long dead people who I happen to have been fond of at some point, I entertained their sad offspring, enough to provide her with </p>
<blockquote><p>No thanks. I didn't realise your copywriting offer was mislabelled as SMM. Please move it to "creative writing" or whatever and refund this job.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can probably guess the continuation - but if you can't, it's something about the definition of terms and how she expects the world to work and etcetera. Hey - there's a reason she's single and starving two years short of menopause. I'm not about to entertain the nonsense, and I'm especially not fond of women who imagine my words are open to <em>their</em> interpretation.</p>
<p>Which brings the matter home : of seventeen, ten who didn't perform, of which ten four who also didn't read, whereas six were only lazy. Plus one utterly confused old woman. Of the remainder, one's labelled as late by the very system, and the other five will no doubt fail to surprise.</p>
<p>To make it plain, and to state it clearly : the kids aren't "progressive". They're just lazy. That's all.</p>
<p>To which plain and clear statement there will of course be some doubts raised, by some voices who etcetera, and so ad infinitum. Those voices will continue, forever. If you're not willing to grow up, "talking about things" is the best possible defense. </p>
<p>Those voices <a href="http://trilema.com/2016/and-they-wont-fucking-yield/">must</a> be <a href=http://trilema.com/2016/the-next-generation/#selection-69.123-69.225>killed</a>.</p>
<p>PS. For the truly curious - yes those "deliveries" delivered, in the sense this term is contemplated among the scum. They have elaborately faked "screenshots" and doctored urls and etcetera to "prove" they "did the work". And yes, on careful inspection there are a coupla hundred hits to the main page that can be traced to this misadventure. They're exactly of the substance of <a href="http://trilema.com/2015/facebook-sends-traffic11eleven/">Facebook traffic</a><sup><a href="#footnote_14_69944" id="identifier_14_69944" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I won't sully the pixels with an exact restatement of the exact same thing, but it is the exact same thing.">xv</a></sup>, and apodictically <a href="http://trilema.com/2014/askfm-laid-bare-or-whats-half-a-million-uniques-to-you/">not worth money</a>.</p>
