<p>I suppose at this juncture it behooves me to point out that </p>

<li>I have no intention to kill myself,</li>
<li>nor did I ever have any intention to kill myself<sup><a href="#footnote_1_69139" id="identifier_1_69139" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="No, not even during adolescence.

17:09:43 <strong>doppler</strong> spew: I don't have a lot of experience with them. however, from what I gather from reading and hearing from other users, there are only a few specific reasons I'd want to use a BSD over a Linux system. (disclaimer: some of this may be false.) with Linux, you get a community and user base with a greater number of retards, you get stupid shit like systemd, but you also get much higher userland and kernel<br />
17:09:49 <strong>doppler</strong> flexibility and higher general system performance because of high optimization. with the BSDs, you get a smaller, generally "better" community, a tighter-knit system that cannot stray nearly as far from a base system than a Linux system could, you get better support for certain specific software (like ZFS, pf, ...), but you also get a system that seems old-fashioned. they seem to miss out on some of the<br />
17:09:55 <strong>doppler</strong> innovations (both technologies and software support) that Linux might get due to its wider use.<br />
17:10:23 <strong>doppler</strong> spew: so all in all I like them about as much as I like a decent Linux distribution.<br />
17:11:01 <strong>spew</strong> it's easier to use<br />
17:11:55 <strong>spew</strong> programming is the same though OBSD compilers are so fucking old<br />
17:12:06 <strong>spew</strong> but it's a nicer experience just using it day to day configuring things<br />
17:12:10 <strong>spew</strong> and having things work<br />
17:12:22 <strong>Aram</strong> openbsd added clang recently.<br />
17:12:26 <strong>spew</strong> haven't used bsd in a long time though<br />
17:12:31 <strong>spew</strong> Aram: yeah I heard that<br />
17:12:38 <strong>sl_</strong> linux is shit tho<br />
17:13:04 <strong>sl_</strong> an asylum constructed and staffed by inmates<br />
17:13:15 <strong>doppler</strong> the kernel, though<br />
17:13:23 <strong>doppler</strong> is the Linux kernel really that much worse than a BSD kernel?<br />
17:13:40 <strong>spew</strong> I can't find my way heads or tails in the linux kernel what is going on<br />
17:13:51 <strong>sl_</strong> how does the kernel help you against what you will inevitably be using linux for<br />
17:13:53 <strong>spew</strong> bsd I can read<br />
17:13:56 <strong>doppler</strong> weird optimizations? bad style?<br />
17:14:05 <strong>spew</strong> bad organization and style<br />
17:14:06 <strong>sl_</strong> too large<br />
17:14:08 <strong>spew</strong> shit organization<br />
17:14:16 <strong>doppler</strong> sl_: it provides an API that you use when you write programs.<br />
17:14:32 <strong>sl_</strong> it provides an api you use when praying to systemd<br />
17:15:15 </font><font color=black><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> doppler well, when was the last time bsd kernel discovered something like <a href=http://log.mkj.lt/trilema/20160929/#197 >log.mkj.lt/trilema/20160929/#197</a></font><font color=lightgray></p>
<p>17:15:16 <strong>sl_</strong> pray systemd doesnt alter it further<br />
17:15:17 <strong>doppler</strong> the linux kernel is indeed fucking huge but it has very good support for paring down your build when you compile<br />
17:15:37 <strong>spew</strong> doppler please be serious<br />
17:15:52 <strong>doppler</strong> it does!<br />
17:16:01 <strong>doppler</strong> (see also: all the embedded shit that runs Linux)<br />
17:16:13 <strong>sl_</strong> what does linux do that you cant get from freebsd at this point<br />
17:16:13 </font><font color=black><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> ...</font><font color=lightgray></p>
<p>17:16:17 <strong>doppler</strong> there's a lot more embedded linux devices than embedded BSD devices<br />
17:16:27 <strong>doppler</strong> sl_: do? probably nothing.<br />
17:16:31 <strong>sl_</strong> you requirements seem fluid<br />
17:16:42 <strong>doppler</strong> well yeah<br />
17:16:43 </font><font color=black><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> sl_ i am wondering if he is trolling or what.</font><font color=lightgray></p>
<p>17:17:08 <strong>doppler</strong> good one, mircea_popescu.<br />
17:17:15 <strong>spew</strong> doppler you're saying this horrific steaming pile of shit is ok because there's a really good system for decontaminating yourself<br />
17:17:20 <strong>doppler</strong> no.<br />
17:17:23 <strong>spew</strong> you are<br />
17:17:29 <strong>doppler</strong> I'm not meaning to.<br />
17:17:40 </font><font color=black><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> doppler that kinda... "fluidity" is usually an indicator<sup><a href="#footnote_4_69139" id="identifier_4_69139" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="It goes much deeper than `an indicator for trolling`. I phrased it in those terms because when in Goatfuckingstan you're well advised to use many goat references. Local flavour aside, one who doesn't sit atop well sorted binary trees of everything is thereby not able to be. I don't mean be the boss, I mean be at all, anything whatsoever. He's the prime candidate for joining a religion, participating in some `representative` process and so forth. He doesn't even get to choose to be a socialist dumbass, his `choice` is made for him by his own dumbassery (and yes the forced mistakes of they without any choice still get misrepresented as choices for their benefit).">v</a></sup>, what can i tell you.</font><font color=lightgray></p>
<p>17:17:42 <strong>doppler</strong> the BSDs all contain some amount of cruft too<br />
17:17:46 <strong>spew</strong> yes<br />
17:17:49 <strong>sl_</strong> its not necessary for me to tear down linux, its necessary for linux to demonstrate some worth<br />
17:17:50 <strong>spew</strong> they certainly do<br />
17:17:59 <strong>spew</strong> I can still figure out what is going on in the BSD kernel<br />
17:18:08 <strong>spew</strong> I give up before I get anywhere whenever I poke around in linux<br />
17:18:15 <strong>doppler</strong> I completely understand that<br />
17:18:22 <strong>doppler</strong> that is a really important aspect<br />
17:18:26 <strong>doppler</strong> being able to grok kernel code<br />
17:18:27 <strong>sl_</strong> i concluded in 1999 linux is more trouble than it is worth<br />
17:18:38 <strong>sl_</strong> and the situation has only deteriorated since then<br />
17:18:40 <strong>spew</strong> I concluded this year that linux is unavoidable<br />
17:18:47 <strong>doppler</strong> but you asked about my opinion<br />
17:18:50 <strong>sl_</strong> sure<br />
17:18:51 <strong>doppler</strong> I don't do anything in the kenrel<br />
17:18:55 <strong>doppler</strong> *kernel<br />
17:19:02 <strong>doppler</strong> (not yet)<br />
17:19:12 <strong>spew</strong> I guess I should try to switch to freebsd and see if the linux emulation is enough<br />
17:19:21 <strong>doppler</strong> I've wondered about that, too<br />
17:19:23 <strong>spew</strong> I have to use all this shit that's just linux<br />
17:19:37 <strong>spew</strong> really just docker and oracle java<br />
17:19:57 <strong>Aram</strong> every half decade I have to do some linux kernel stuff, and it's always different. they changed everything during this time. while half of the design and implementation of 4.4 BSD still applies 21 years later.<br />
17:20:17 <strong>spew</strong> that's a good point too<br />
17:20:26 <strong>spew</strong> because 4.4 bsd actually had a design and implementation<br />
17:20:30 <strong>spew</strong> linux just had an implementation<br />
17:20:32 <strong>doppler</strong> spew: like, especially in a situation like that, there's something to be said for "I can just slap Linux on it and it works". you don't debug the kernel on the same machine that you run docker on, do you?<br />
17:20:34 </font><font color=black><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> incidentally, is there a log of this channel anywhere that i could read ?</font><font color=lightgray></p>
<p>17:20:39 <strong>Aram</strong> no log<br />

17:21:03 <strong>Aram</strong> deliberately<br />
17:21:18 <strong>doppler</strong> mircea_popescu: like, "no logging allowed".<br />

In the terms of the controlling article, the eternal Daniel-of-the-village perceives himself in this blessed state where he is a) no part of any mechanism and also b) able to completely observe all mechanisms. That this is a strict violation of the most basic physics does not interest the adolescent - his anchoring in reality is mostly fantastic yet. 
From that extraordinary position of complete independence and also complete knowledge, an exact mirror of the `action without responsibility` fetish of the age, the adolescent mind then proceeds to judge all things. Let's hear him :
I see the world differently than anyone else. Because of all of the injustices I went through and the worldview I developed because of them, I must be destined for greatness. I must be destined to change the world, to shape it into an image that suits me!
 ~His Holyness Elliot Rodger, the patron saint and imago of ESLtards everywhere.
I am an intellectual who is destined for greatness. I would never perform a low-class service job.
 ~His Holyness Elliot Rodger, the patron saint and imago of ESLtards everywhere.
This then is what allows nobody on a stick to imagine anything below him. That ` well congrats on being mayor of goatfuckistan or whatever.` seen later would have read exactly the same applied to anything, from `congrats on being God` onwards. They call this `anonimity`, the current shithead generation, but it's nothing more, nor anything other, than historical adolescentine identity. He who has so little (ie nothing) and wants so much (ie, it all) could scarcely construct anything else for himself. `Anonimity`, ie, feed me and never hold me up to any standards ; `anonimity` ie, listen to what I say but don't judge it ; `anonimity` ie, I know things but I don't know where ; and so following.
From all that crap then follows the imbecile sort of `patriotism` here displayed. Consider that older description : 
So we understand each other : John is some poor and kinda stupid kid from some ghetto in some indistinct townlet. One day, Mircea the Bad comes there on whatever business, sits down in the bar with his two bitches curled up at his feet and drinks a rum or something. The girls from the ghetto, for love of their country (in our example, that sad ghetto) pick John up forcibly, sit him down at the table next to mine and curl at his feet, just like the other two. They're definitely not slavegirls, they have neither the training nor the skills nor in the end the needs or structure of that relationship, and no marble columns, no gardens where water sprinkles among the cypress nor artesian fountains springing forth marzipan await them at home, but instead the nude concrete walls, the [low class mass produced kitsch wallhanging stuff], the bedbug infested pressed shitboard nightstand. But indifferent to all these points, they play a role to support a theory : the theory that here too, in the assghetto of shit `we got fine stuff`, and a John who, even if only four letters long, is still quite as great as any Mircea come from afar.
Well, that's patriotism, the girls in this example show `love of their ghetto` and that's the thing upon which socialist Romania was built, if you're curious - a structure otherwise borrowed from Carlist Romania. Totul pentru patrie!  
It's not just communist Romania, or for that matter Carlist Romania, that were built on this. All socialism is ever built on this same stupidity, because that's all there is when it comes to stupid : some idiots will band together to lend each other imagological support in face of their utter, all-consuming fear. Because maturation is scary. Because it is different. Because they're weak and stupid. What more ?">xiii</a></sup> </font><font color=lightgray></p>

18:43:52 <strong>Aram</strong> my tinnitus has been getting worse and worse the last couple of hours.<br />
18:43:53 <strong>echoline</strong> oh<br />
18:43:58 <strong>echoline</strong> you guys don't take hardware?<br />
18:44:14 <strong>doppler</strong> pipe your hardware stream to me<br />
18:44:16 <strong>echoline</strong> do any of you a) take hardware and more importantly b) get it working<br />
18:44:27 <strong>doppler</strong> what do you have?<br />
18:44:31 <strong>echoline</strong> although it's kind of a catch-22<br />
18:44:40 <strong>echoline</strong> i have an old toshiba satellite<br />
18:44:47 <strong>echoline</strong> everything works great except the wifi<br />
18:44:49 <strong>khm</strong> I take good hardware and do nothing with it<br />
18:44:54 <strong>echoline</strong> yeah see<br />
18:44:54 <strong>doppler</strong> ^^^<br />
18:44:54 <strong>khm</strong> click here to stay involved<br />
18:45:00 <strong>Aram</strong> do you have a CDC 6500?<br />
18:45:03 <strong>echoline</strong> if you're gonna do nothing i'll just keep it<br />
18:45:04 <strong>Aram</strong> or a cray 1?<br />
18:45:20 <strong>echoline</strong> Aram: hah<br />
18:45:25 <strong>doppler</strong> any PDPs?<br />
18:45:30 <strong>doppler</strong> how about some symbolics gear<br />
18:45:46 <strong>echoline</strong> it's a catch-22 for me<br />
18:45:51 <strong>aiju</strong> he said it's a toshiba satellite<br />
18:46:02 <strong>echoline</strong> if i send someone the laptop and they make it work<br />
18:46:10 <strong>echoline</strong> then at least it works<br />
18:46:30 <strong>echoline</strong> the card is an ipw2100 or 2200<br />
18:46:32 <strong>echoline</strong> i forget<br />
18:46:47 <strong>doppler</strong> what is the catch 22 part<br />
18:46:48 <strong>kersnert</strong> hoarders gotta hoard<br />
18:46:57 <strong>echoline</strong> doppler: i will no longer own the laptop after it works<br />
18:47:19 <strong>doppler</strong> it's old shit anyway though<br />
18:47:22 <strong>doppler</strong> so who cares<br />
18:47:31 <strong>echoline</strong> i dunno<br />
18:47:35 <strong>echoline</strong> i want to do it myself<br />
18:47:51 <strong>echoline</strong> for the lulz and street cred<br />
18:47:53 <strong>khm</strong> so do it<br />
18:47:56 <strong>doppler</strong> -- signed, the dude who owns more computers than he weighs in pounds<br />
18:47:59 <strong>echoline</strong> i can't khm i tried<br />
18:47:59 <strong>khm</strong> rsc already started an ipw2200 driver<br />
18:48:02 <strong>echoline</strong> i'm too stoopid<br />
18:48:04 <strong>khm</strong> just finish it<br />
18:48:07 <strong>khm</strong> will<br />
18:48:09 <strong>khm</strong> in that case<br />
18:48:12 <strong>khm</strong> get a job.<br />
18:48:15 <strong>echoline</strong> ok so it's an ipw2100<br />
18:48:31 <strong>echoline</strong> i remember it was the one he didn't start the driver for<br />
18:48:35 <strong>doppler</strong> that is wireless B<br />
18:49:14 <strong>qeed</strong> at least thats not the rtl driver that thing is like 40,000 lines of code and only linux code as a reference<br />
18:49:58 <strong>aiju</strong> less noise, more code<br />
18:50:00 <strong>qeed</strong> openbsd driver code is very small and simple to port<br />
18:51:12 <strong>kremlin</strong> ports<br />
18:51:24 <strong>sl_</strong> shut up<br />
18:51:29 <strong>kremlin</strong> :(<br />
18:51:35 <strong>khm</strong> I agree with sl_<br />
18:51:52 <strong>Aram</strong> I think the problem I am having now is some general Go runtime assumption bullshit rather than sparc64 crazyness.<br />
18:51:55 <strong>Aram</strong> but I am not sure yet.<br />
18:52:30 <strong>Aram</strong> it could simply not support 8kB pages.<br />
18:55:07 <strong>aiju</strong> i hate how we don't have dual port rams<br />
18:55:17 <strong>aiju</strong> i bet  it's just a fucking checkbox the chinese have to tick<br />
18:55:22 <strong>aiju</strong> but they don't let us use them :(<br />
18:57:49 <strong>doppler</strong> whoa google looks weird<br />
18:58:07 <strong>doppler</strong> https://a.uguu.se/SDrWP3U5H6om.png<br />
18:58:53 <strong>khm</strong> style="width: 30%;"<br />
19:00:13 <strong>khm</strong> does google not have a plain html version available any more<br />
19:02:07 <strong>doppler</strong> gmail does<br />
19:02:14 <strong>doppler</strong> but I don't think google search has had that for a LONG time<br />
19:02:14 <strong>khm</strong> I mean for the search results<br />
19:03:29 <strong>khm</strong> this kind of shit is why ddg.gg/lite is my default search engine<br />
19:03:51 <strong>Aram</strong> doppler: it used to have until recently<br />
19:04:45 <strong>doppler</strong> huh, I haven't noticed it in years<br />
19:04:52 <strong>doppler</strong> was there a button at the bottom of the page or something?<br />
19:05:14 <strong>Aram</strong> no<br />
19:05:21 <strong>Aram</strong> you had to know the url<br />
19:05:45 <strong>Aram</strong> I think it was google.com/linux, but I might be mistaken<br />
19:06:06 <strong>doppler</strong> maybe you can get it to serve plain HTML with a modified user agent string<br />
19:06:32 <strong>Aram</strong> that sounds like gentoo-level of autism.<br />
19:06:40 <strong>Aram</strong> you can simply do what khm just said.<br />
19:07:08 <strong>doppler</strong> I actually had to do the reverse of that when I used a macintosh as my desktop<br />
19:07:29 <strong>doppler</strong> sites started detecting that I was on some old-ass version of Safari, and wouldn't let me use any features<br />
19:07:46 <strong>doppler</strong> so I just had it claim that it was the latest version of chrome, and sites worked fine again<br />
19:08:09 <strong>Aram</strong> and what did you learn from this experience?<br />
19:08:16 <strong>doppler</strong> not worth the trouble<br />
19:08:33 <strong>doppler</strong> did you see my screenshot? I just use chromium now and avoid the fuss, fuck it :)<br />
19:09:02 <strong>khm</strong> I'm going to set up a crowdfunding thing to buy presto from opera<br />
19:09:20 <strong>doppler</strong> web technologies already suck, so I might as well have least shitty experience<br />
19:09:40 <strong>Aram</strong> khm: I don't understand why didn't they open source it, since they abandoned it :(.<br />
19:09:58 <strong>khm</strong> then I'll set up another one to hire john carmack to port it to /dev/draw<br />
19:10:14 <strong>khm</strong> Aram: they didn't really abandon it.  only their desktop and android browser changed.<br />
19:10:24 <strong>Aram</strong> what else do they have?<br />
19:10:24 <strong>khm</strong> all the dumbphones that use opera still use the presto engine.<br />
19:10:28 <strong>Aram</strong> I see.<br />
19:10:43 <strong>khm</strong> and the wii, and all that kind of shit.<br />
19:11:22 <strong>khm</strong> this chinese company that bought them doesn't give a shit about anything but user surveillance, though, so I bet they'd sell<br />
19:11:57 <strong>doppler</strong> I think my DSi has an embedded opera browser<br />
19:12:05 <strong>doppler</strong> browsing on a DS just feels retarded :)<br />
19:18:35 <strong>aiju</strong> hahaha "if bitcoin takes over, we are all in a world of hell"<br />
19:21:50 <strong>doppler</strong> tell that to mircea<br />
19:22:28 <strong>khm</strong> we can't, he's not here<br />
19:22:49 <strong>khm</strong> there is just this impostor<br />
19:40:01 </font><font color=black><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> ~nobody has working name completion huh.</font><font color=lightgray><br />
19:40:09 </font><font color=black><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> aiju that's kinda the idea. </font><font color=lightgray></p>
<p>19:40:46 <strong>doppler</strong> my nick completion works fine<br />
19:42:21 <strong>aiju</strong> what is it with these shitty "burn" attempts?<br />
19:42:29 <strong>aiju</strong> you're just making yourself look like an idiot<br />
19:42:43 </font><font color=black><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> no, i was candid. ~everyone being in a world of hell is pretty much the point of bitcoin.</font><font color=lightgray><br />
19:42:54 <strong>aiju</strong> no, i'm talking about the line before that<br />
19:43:48 </font><font color=black><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> i come to expect being referenced as mircea_popescu because mi/t is simpler for most civilised folk than the alternative. you know, sort-of like shoes or shirts are not mandatory but expected.</font><font color=lightgray></p>
<p>19:44:15 <strong>_sl</strong> yeah, but you're not even him.<br />
19:45:09 <strong>aiju</strong> you mean you want to be referred to as mischief?<br />
19:45:46 </font><font color=black><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> here's a good rule of thumb : if you're not smart enough to run the software in your head find a machine, try it out there.</font><font color=lightgray></p>
<p>19:45:56 <strong>aiju</strong> ? what<br />
19:46:06 </font><font color=black><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> mi-tab resolves to mircea_popescu not to mischief because s is after r in the alphabet.</font><font color=lightgray></p>
<p>19:46:15 <strong>_sl</strong> this dude is a fraud.<br />
19:46:45 <strong>asciilifeform</strong> hi folks, i was told you had a sham mircea_popescu in here<br />
19:47:11 </font><font color=black><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> so, to sum up the general point : it's not "burn" attempts. it's that you folk are long on stupid and short on most everything else, which tends to get you hurt.</font><font color=lightgray></p>
<p>19:47:15 <strong>asciilifeform</strong> how did you distinguish him from your old, correct one ?<br />
19:47:16 <strong>aiju</strong> mircea_popescu: that's not how nick completion works :)<br />
19:47:22 </font><font color=black><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> i'm sure it isn't.</font><font color=lightgray></p>
<p>19:47:49 <strong>_sl</strong> asciilifeform: tradecraft<br />
19:48:08 </font><font color=black><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> are you the real asciilifeform ?</font><font color=lightgray></p>
<p>19:48:18 <strong>_sl</strong> asciilifeform: he's advanced to denigrating the channel in general, but still refuses to /part<br />
19:48:22 <strong>asciilifeform</strong> nah, i killed and ate the real one long ago<br />
19:48:31 <strong>_sl</strong> oh<br />
19:48:33 <strong>_sl</strong> you're the same guy<br />
19:48:38 <strong>aiju</strong> :)<br />

<p>19:48:46 <strong>asciilifeform</strong> _sl: tradecraft, i.e. you had a vernam pad set up with the correct one ?<br />
19:49:10 <strong>_sl</strong> sources and methods, dude<br />
19:49:14 <strong>echoline</strong> and how come i get banned just for smoking perfectly legal marijuana? this channel is rigged<br />
19:49:53 </font><font color=black><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> check it out, we agree on even this!</font><font color=lightgray></p>
<p>19:50:02 <strong>asciilifeform</strong> no vodka also ?<br />
19:52:00 </font><font color=black><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> keeping enumerated-badness lists over the entire ipv6 space seems like a winner.</font><font color=lightgray></p>
<p>19:53:28 <strong>aiju</strong> yeah, we should just ban all ipv6 addresses<br />
19:53:31 <strong>aiju</strong> save time<br />
19:53:53 </font><font color=black><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> word.</font><font color=lightgray></p>
<p>19:56:16 <strong>aiju</strong> what is it with you inserting random ~ into sentences?<br />
19:56:52 </font><font color=black><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> ~ means "approximately" if prefix. if both prefix and suffix it's a kind of stress.</font><font color=lightgray></p>
<p>20:17:39 <strong>phc</strong> in what writing system is that?<br />
20:21:19 </font><font color=black><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> i'm enough of an idiosyncratic asshole to maintain my own writing system.</font><font color=lightgray></p>
<p>20:21:42 <strong>sam-d</strong> mircea_popescu: I don't think you realize that (1) you basically joined, said "hey guys be my friend, I'm important, I have a blog"<sup><a href="#footnote_22_69139" id="identifier_22_69139" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Amusingly, that's a more apt description of that other time rather than this one.

The only thing of substance you've brought here is your cryptanarchy bullshit, which you have no reason to assume we care about, especially since we immediately made it clear that we don't.<br />
20:21:57 <strong>sam-d</strong> speaking for myself, this has passed the point of being entertaining<br />
20:22:48 <strong>sam-d</strong> (2) this channel doesn't have much to do with cat-v.org anymore. Afaict after having been here a couple years or so it's just the same group of people carried forward.<br />
20:23:29 </font><font color=black><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> sam-d from over here the situation is that man walks into a bar, orders a round for the house, everyone goes crazy with "what the fuck, does he think we're poor" and assorted braindamage indicative of children without any bar experience / truly weird third worlders.</font><font color=lightgray></p>
<p>20:24:00 <strong>kersnert</strong> you didn't send the money<br />
20:24:10 </font><font color=black><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> but yes, it's pretty evident ~nobody involved has much relevancy past their own fambly / livejournal followers.</font><font color=lightgray></p>
<p>20:24:11 <strong>_sl</strong> you don't know how to read the room.<br />
20:24:23 <strong>sam-d</strong> mircea_popescu: I appreciate that you were trying to be nice, but I don't know why you insist that we care about your attempt to be nice.<br />
20:24:33 </font><font color=black><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> i dun give a shit, you keep bringing it up.</font><font color=lightgray></p>
<p>20:24:38 <strong>_sl</strong> he's not trying to be nice.<br />
20:24:48 </font><font color=black><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> actually, i'm not trying.</font><font color=lightgray></p>
<p>20:24:52 <strong>_sl</strong> why are you here<br />
20:24:58 <strong>sam-d</strong> ^<br />
20:25:07 <strong>_sl</strong> see, he's not trying to be nice.<br />
20:25:08 </font><font color=black><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> just came in one day. no fucking idea. why are you here ?</font><font color=lightgray></p>
<p>20:25:11 <strong>aiju</strong> what the fuck is "fambly"<br />
20:25:34 </font><font color=black><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> peculiar spelling of "family", in the vein of "twu wuv". mildly derrogatory, like twu wuv.</font><font color=lightgray></p>
<p>20:25:41 <strong>_sl</strong> because i live here<br />
20:25:52 <strong>_sl</strong> why do you desperately want us to believe you ar emircea popescu<br />
20:26:01 </font><font color=black><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> right.</font><font color=lightgray></p>
<p>20:26:04 <strong>sam-d</strong> mircea_popescu: because my friends are here.<br />
20:26:05 <strong>_sl</strong> when you clearly aren't<br />
20:26:15 </font><font color=black><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> sam-d it shows.</font><font color=lightgray></p>
<p>20:26:17 <strong>aiju</strong> sounds like 4chan bullshit<br />
20:26:22 </font><font color=black><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> i don't follow my friends QUITE to that degree.</font><font color=lightgray></p>
<p>20:26:39 <strong>doppler</strong> probably 8ch<br />
20:26:48 <strong>doppler</strong> 4chan doesnt know about this channel<br />
20:26:52 <strong>aiju</strong> hahahahahahaha<br />
20:26:58 <strong>aiju</strong> doppler: you are naive.<br />
20:27:05 <strong>doppler</strong> ok<br />
20:27:11 <strong>_sl</strong> dude has had enough time to google his own nick now<br />
20:27:14 <strong>aiju</strong> doppler: who do you think made the "URIEL IS RIGHT" sticker on the back of the fqa? :)<br />
20:27:31 <strong>doppler</strong> I guessed sl or khm<br />
20:27:53 <strong>aiju</strong> it's some bullshit 4chan meme<br />
20:28:44 <strong>doppler</strong> also isn't it URIEL WAS RIGHT<br />
20:28:50 <strong>doppler</strong> ;)<br />
20:28:54 <strong>_sl</strong> yes<br />
20:28:58 <strong>_sl</strong> it's a reference to x-men comics<br />
20:28:58 <strong>aiju</strong> doppler: whatever, nerd<br />
20:29:03 <strong>doppler</strong> so who is naive<br />
20:29:03 <strong>_sl</strong> i can explain it if you care<br />
20:29:07 <strong>doppler</strong> jk<br />
20:29:10 <strong>doppler</strong> sure sl<br />
20:29:18 <strong>aiju</strong> doppler: that's not what that word means.<br />
20:30:10 <strong>_sl</strong> in the early 2000s grant morrison did a run on NEW X-MEN<br />
20:30:23 <strong>_sl</strong> where a bunch of young teenagers were a new class at xavier's school<br />
20:30:33 <strong>doppler</strong> okay<br />
20:30:36 <strong>_sl</strong> one of them was a smartass genius shithead kid who wore a t-shirt with this slogan MAGNETO WAS RIGHT<br />
20:30:46 <strong>_sl</strong> and a propaganda image of magneto's head (in helmet)<br />
20:31:14 <strong>doppler</strong> haha nice<br />
20:31:17 <strong>_sl</strong> magneto being the x-men's first arch nemesis, a mutant supremacist (malcolm x to prof x's martin luther king)<br />
20:31:28 <strong>_sl</strong> anyway this is a reference to that<br />
20:31:33 <strong>doppler</strong> so is there some connection to 4chan<br />
20:31:57 <strong>_sl</strong> http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3094/116386-178862-magneto.JPG<br />
20:32:06 <strong>_sl</strong> the URIEL WAS RIGHT image was made by some chan retards<br />
20:32:09 <strong>_sl</strong> i found it<br />
20:32:12 <strong>doppler</strong> oh, hahaba<br />
20:32:32 <strong>_sl</strong> http://comicnewbies.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/quentin.jpg <- quentin quire<br />
20:33:05 <strong>qeed</strong> damn thats a nice look<br />
20:34:04 <strong>doppler</strong> i cant click links on my phone, will look in a few minutes<br />
20:34:11 <strong>aiju</strong> some 4chan people have a strange obsession with cat-v<br />
20:34:50 <strong>sam-d</strong> the bs that brought this guy here in the first place was this, which was probably one of those 4chan people: http://www.loper-os.org/?p=1762&#038;cpage=1#comment-17919<br />
20:35:03 <strong>^7heo</strong> aiju: some insects have a strange obsession with light<br />
20:35:37 <strong>sam-d</strong> by his own admission (when he joins the channel, from the logs) he's not associated with us.<br />
20:36:33 <strong>_sl</strong> this is not the channel you're looking for<br />
20:37:00 <strong>Aram</strong> looks like the guy who posted the cat-v link on his blog must have been a 4chan retard.<br />
20:37:20 <strong>sam-d</strong> chat log here, draw your own conclusions: http://log.mkj.lt/trilema/20160929/#379<br />
20:37:35 </font><font color=black><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> aren't logs cool by the way ?</font><font color=lightgray></p>
<p>20:37:37 <strong>sam-d</strong> if you can stand to read that<br />
20:37:48 <strong>Aram</strong> mircea_popescu: do you even know why the channel is called "cat -v"? do you even know what "cat -v" is?<br />
20:37:50 <strong>sam-d</strong> mircea_popescu: lurking is cool too<br />
20:38:11 </font><font color=black><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> Aram i know what cat -v is ; i have nfi why this channel is anything.</font><font color=lightgray></p>
<p>20:38:13 <strong>_sl</strong> i keep asking why he's here<br />
20:38:31 <strong>Aram</strong> please explain what cat -v is then.<br />
20:38:35 <strong>aiju</strong> sam-d: i want an apology for linking me to this crap<br />
20:38:37 </font><font color=black><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> sam-d not everyone is a shy introvert.</font><font color=lightgray></p>
<p>20:38:48 <strong>sam-d</strong> aiju: sorry, should have put the warning beforehand.<br />
20:38:59 <strong>sam-d</strong> ???<br />
20:39:18 <strong>sam-d</strong> I won't even dispute your claim, but I don't get how that's relevant to anything<br />
20:39:18 <strong>_sl</strong> this would be fascinating if i gave a shit.<br />
20:39:53 <strong>sam-d</strong> oh, lurking<br />

<p>20:40:37 <strong>Aram</strong> so you have no fucking clue<br />
20:40:48 <strong>_sl</strong> this chat log is shit, you're ignorant of what you're mocking.<br />
20:41:00 <strong>Aram</strong> if you quote from the man page you are not aware of teh historical significance of cat -v, and why do we care about<br />
20:41:06 <strong>Aram</strong> it<br />
20:41:22 </font><font color=black><strong>mircea_popescu</strong> _sl hey, i'd have read the logs if you had any. but otherwise, i'm not mocking.</font><font color=lightgray><br />

<p>20:42:15 <strong>_sl</strong> mircea_popescu: i'm talking about the log of the channel where you apparently came from.<br />

[<a href="#identifier_11_69139" class="footnote-link footnote-back-link">&#8617;</a>]</li><li id="footnote_12_69139" class="footnote">This is the core of the "dispute" here, such as it is. In the terms of <a href=http://trilema.com/2012/anonimity-or-the-urban-versus-rural-dispute/>the controlling article</a>, the eternal <a href=http://trilema.com/2012/anonimity-or-the-urban-versus-rural-dispute/#selection-93.6-97.10>Daniel-of-the-village</a> perceives himself in this blessed state where he is a) no part of any mechanism and also b) able to completely observe all mechanisms. That this is a strict violation of the most basic physics does not interest the adolescent - his anchoring in reality is mostly fantastic yet. </p>
<p>From that extraordinary position of complete independence and also complete knowledge, an exact mirror of the "action without responsibility" fetish of the age, the adolescent mind then proceeds to judge all things. Let's hear him :</p>
<blockquote><p>I see the world differently than anyone else. Because of all of the injustices I went through and the worldview I developed because of them, I must be destined for greatness. I must be destined to change the world, to shape it into an image that suits me!<br />
 ~His Holyness <a href=http://trilema.com/2016/the-story-of-elliot-rodger-by-elliot-rodger-adnotated-part-four/#selection-549.0-549.255>Elliot Rodger</a>, the <a href=http://trilema.com/2016/the-story-of-elliot-rodger-by-elliot-rodger-adnotated-part-nine/#selection-81.197-81.298>patron saint and imago</a> of ESLtards everywhere.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I am an intellectual who is destined for greatness. I would never perform a low-class service job.<br />
 ~His Holyness <a href=http://trilema.com/2016/the-story-of-elliot-rodger-by-elliot-rodger-adnotated-part-five/#selection-897.263-897.361>Elliot Rodger</a>, the <a href=http://trilema.com/2016/the-story-of-elliot-rodger-by-elliot-rodger-adnotated-part-nine/#selection-81.197-81.298>patron saint and imago</a> of ESLtards everywhere.</p></blockquote>
<p>This then is what allows nobody on a stick to imagine <em>anything</em> below him. That " well congrats on being mayor of goatfuckistan or whatever." seen later would have read <em>exactly the same</em> applied to anything, from "congrats on being God" onwards. They call this "anonimity", the current shithead generation, but it's nothing more, nor anything other, than historical adolescentine identity. He who has so little (ie nothing) and wants so much (ie, it all) could scarcely construct anything else for himself. "Anonimity", ie, feed me and never hold me up to any standards ; "anonimity" ie, listen to what I say but don't judge it ; "anonimity" ie, I know things but I don't know where ; and so following.</p>
<p>From all that crap then follows the <span style="background-color:#d3d3d3" id="select">imbecile sort of "patriotism" here displayed</span>. Consider <a href=http://trilema.com/2014/the-death-of-taxes/#identifier_4_55254>that older description</a> : </p>
<blockquote><p>So we understand each other : John is some poor and kinda stupid kid from some ghetto in some indistinct townlet. One day, Mircea the Bad comes there on whatever business, sits down in the bar with his two bitches curled up at his feet and drinks a rum or something. The girls from the ghetto, for love of their country (in our example, that sad ghetto) pick John up forcibly, sit him down at the table next to mine and curl at his feet, just like the other two. They're definitely not slavegirls, they have neither the training nor the skills nor in the end the needs or structure of that relationship, and no marble columns, no gardens where water sprinkles among the cypress nor artesian fountains springing forth marzipan await them at home, but instead the nude concrete walls, the [low class mass produced kitsch wallhanging stuff], the bedbug infested pressed shitboard nightstand. But indifferent to all these points, they play a role to support a theory : the theory that here too, in the assghetto of shit "we got fine stuff", and a John who, even if only four letters long, is still quite as great as any Mircea come from afar.</p>
<p>Well, that's patriotism, the girls in this example show "love of their ghetto" and that's the thing upon which socialist Romania was built, if you're curious - a structure otherwise borrowed from Carlist Romania. Totul pentru patrie!  </p></blockquote>
<p>It's not just communist Romania, or for that matter Carlist Romania, that were built on this. All socialism is ever built on this same stupidity, because that's all there is when it comes to stupid : some idiots will band together to lend each other imagological support in face of their utter, all-consuming fear. Because maturation is scary. Because it is different. Because they're weak and stupid. What more ?

						<p>The reason they're petrified, although I can't for a second imagine you don't know or that it isn't deliberate, is that they try to engage you with the anglotard handshake and it fails. The SYN is at 17:06:05, "we're not fancy people". The expected SYN/ACK response is very strictly "oh no, you guys are great, no such thing as competence may exist, nobody can ever have any power, we're all equal" yadda yadda. The response you provide is not simply failure, it's literally signing off as Chtulhu. To mock the castrated ESL beta bois for their very castration is strictly indistinguishable for terrorism, psychopathy and generally speaking  evil by them. For the whole rest of the conversation they're flailing desperately around in a doomed attempt to recover some face after that original catastrophe. Much like the whole rest of their lives.</p>
