Through the miraculous workings of the Divinity Machine as previously described, lots and lots and lots of... users, let's say, blessfully unaware of the inner workings of social media and the ever-so-revolutionary web come to the mistaken conclusion that someone's been looking at them.
On second pass... it may even be that technically that conclusion isn't even all that mistaken. How do you distinguish a bot and a... user, let's say ? Hm ?
But it doesn't stop there, either. Check this beauty out (I only now found it) :
Subject: 	[Fwd: MirceaPopescu, You are Hot!]
From:    `OkCupid` 
Date:    Mon, December 28, 2015 12:28 am
Hey MirceaPopescu,
We just detected that youâ€™re now among the most attractive people on
OkCupid. We learned this from clicks to your profile and reactions to you
in Quickmatch. Did you get a new haircut or something? Well, itâ€™s
working!
To celebrate, weâ€™ve adjusted your OkCupid experience:
********************************************************
*  Youâ€™ll see more attractive people in your results.  *
********************************************************
This wonâ€™t affect your match percentages, which are still based purely
on your answers and desired matchâ€™s answers. But weâ€™ll recommend more
attractive people to you. Youâ€™ll also appear more often to other
attractive people.
Sign in to see your newly-shuffled matches. Have fun, and donâ€™t let this
go to your head.
Totally, I got a new haircut. I call it the sed.
But imagine this wonder, if you will! I'm supposed to believe they've been keeping all the hot sluts hidden, because totally, this makes absolute sense if you're running a webservice. I suppose next Amazon's rolling out a `hey, here's all the good stuff we weren't showing you before, not like we're actually in the business of making volume`, and the doctor's gonna go `Oh, you're a friend of John's ? Well in that case I got real medicine for you. Everyone else I'm giving tic-tacs.`
And yet you knew it all along, didn't you ?
Anyway, the point being : even ex-Home Shopping Network IAC/InterActive fucking fell for it. As a friend put it `wow, the best scammers in the world - they could scam anyone` and yet still fucking fell for it. What chances do you have ?">i</a></sup><br />

<p><b>Her</b> Greetings and how are you? Alberta este foarte friguroasa. Basically the North Pole.<br />

<p><b>Her</b> ok, you're skillful to live in such a hot climate. my skills are winter based ;)<br />
<b>You</b> what, oil drilling ?</p>
<p><b>Her</b> Investment banking but all our clients are o&#038;g as you can imagine.<br />
<b>You</b> hehehe. you wanna google me ?</p>
<p><b>Her</b> why? are you a local celebrity?<br />
<b>You</b> well not exactly local not exactly celebrity.</p>

alllll the damned time. I could point out that the other reaction is a lot more sensible, but then you could point out that slut is 18 and this chick more like 30something, so what the fuck could she do other than sit on ass and dream about a world that no longer includes her ?
You'd have a point, and what's more : now you also understand the fundamental problem with politics. Exactly like in the case of suicide, those who actually do it had no business doing it in the first place and everyone else should have done it long ago.">ii</a></sup><br />

<p><b>Her</b> oh my friend, the internet trolls hate you. how do you sleep at night? lolol<br />
<b>You</b> http://trilema.com/2010/nsfw-mosu-cu-joarda/ << with them.</p>

<b>You</b> they're my slaves.<sup><a href="#footnote_4_64454" id="identifier_4_64454" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I originally interpreted her comment in the context that seemed apparent at that time - obnoxious 30something `in control` (think Marcy in Married with Children or similar scumpuss), ie that if the women were present they'd have control of my fucking household and consequently I couldn't be chatting with stray sluts. Turns out that's not what she meant, but she's not willing to stand behind the alternative interpretation either, so.. ah well.">v</a></sup></p>
<p><b>Her</b> that was pretty evident.<br />
<b>You</b> oh you meant it the other way ? lol! that's not how it works. what is this, "why would we go to the restaurant, we have all this food at home!" or something ?</p>
<p><b>Her</b> ? not at all. What are you the Romo Christian Grey?<sup><a href="#footnote_5_64454" id="identifier_5_64454" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This is amusing because I had discussed this earlier that same day with slavegirl. She had heard of the 50 shades thing but not read it, and assumed on the basis of her own (rather extensive, by now) experience in the field that it's you know, about BDSM and stuff. 
Well... it isn't. That book is written by people who aren't in BDSM for the benefit of people who aren't in BDSM (much like `financial mainstream news` is written by people who aren't in finance for the benefit of people who don't have money). The only sane way one could describe Christian Grey is, `male nurse working without pay in a strange sort of mental hospital, while the administration does its best to misrepresent the whole sordid affair as somehow hot and cool through trying to put forth a very flimsy pretense of being me`. If your idea of a Master is Grey then I suppose your idea of a Goldstein is Madoff and your idea of a Nobel laureate is Hussein Bahamas and so on and so forth. From what I hear there's a kingdom in heaven you'll inherit. Including all its bridges.">vi</a></sup><br />
<b>You</b> well no. he's the wanna-be me. so what do you do other than mortaging drill bits in the soon-to-be-inexistent canadian oil and gas ?</p>
<p><b>Her</b>     ha. none of that. I'm a corporate event planner, I throw parties for people like you.<sup><a href="#footnote_6_64454" id="identifier_6_64454" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="First off, the sort of derps she throws parties for are `like me` exactly in the way and to the degree that Gray derp is me. Second off, but a lot more amusing - this chick actually thinks she's in Investment Banking. She does. Her. Yes.
I met a derp exactly identical at some social function here, she was `in Investment Banking` in the sense of... the receptionist. Say what you will in your defense, I come from a place where we handle things better than this.">vii</a></sup> We're international, or something.<br />
<b>You</b> doesn't sound like much of a gig, does it ?</p>

<b>You</b> a, sorry!</p>
<p><b>Her</b> It's actually a great fit for me. Its fun, its stressful, I travel,meet interesting people and it pays well.

<p><b>Her</b> thanks for the life advice person I just met on the internet. We are not a domestic i bank, so I think it will be ok ;)<sup><a href="#footnote_10_64454" id="identifier_10_64454" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Not domestic, you see.">xi</a></sup><br />
<b>You</b> aite :)</p>
<p><b>Her</b> but please do continue to insult my life choices.

<b>You</b> hahaha. i suspect we share the same views on that whole subculture, actually.</p>
<p><b>Her</b> i somehow doubt that.<br />
<b>You</b> how do you figure ?</p>

<b>You</b >you know, someone can genuinely think alberta's going to shit without NECESSARILY it being some sort of juvenile ploy.</p>

<p><b>You</b> Hey there.<br />
<b>Her</b> Hello. It is quite a random thing for you to message me, I think.</p>
<p><b>You</b> Not more than it is for strangers to talk, generally.<br />
<b>Her</b> I just wonder how you arrived at my profile, as we are not a high match..we are not even relatively close in location. I can appreciate the slim chance of the happening that has occurred here, is what I mean to say.</p>
<p><b>You</b> I'm well networked, so to speak. I see more of the internet than the average user. How's your domme careerg going ?<br />
<b>Her</b> It's non-existent. I put it on there hoping some sad fucker would message me and pay me to abuse him. It has not really happened yet. ;)  I'm curious about these connections you speak of</p>
<p><b>You</b> hey, are you a susceptible kind ?<br />
<b>Her</b> I am interested in making money and not having to devote my time to something that I don't believe in. A dominatrix can make a lot of money. Susceptible? How do you mean?<sup><a href="#footnote_14_64454" id="identifier_14_64454" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="For the record, susceptible means easily insulted. You know, like the old nag above.">xv</a></sup></p>
<p><b>You</b> ok ima be honest. you're so fucking quant&#038;naive it's endearing. it just so jhappens that being a domme is probably the highest average income career path for a female.<sup><a href="#footnote_15_64454" id="identifier_15_64454" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Understand the concept of average income. 
If population A consists of 100 girls, of which 90 flunk the very demanding engineering programme and 9 more flunk the length of business promotions etc required so in the end one makes it to be the CEO of General Dynamics (Phebe Novakovic, look her up), then population A earns 99 * 75k a year + 1 * 19 mn (yeah, it tripled last year - for... some reason). 
If population B consists idem of 100 girls, of which 90 fail to make it to Hollywood and 9 live out their lives waiting tables in LA for one to make it to be the butt of a generation, then population B earns 99 * (2.65 an hour + tips) + 30 mn (lifetime, not salary). 
Finally, if population C consists idem of 100 girls, 65 of which make 1mn a year or so and 35 of which fail to thrive (in the sense of not making quite a million a year or so), then it is an absolute and certain fact that as a young slut your best choice is to go into line C. 
There's no ifs or buts about this, A readily beats B, but C beats the shit out of A and B combined. Them's the breaks, that's what it is, like it or not. 
Do you advise your own daughter with a view to market, and reality, and sanity, or do you advise your own daughter with a view to nonsense, and ideology, and your own delusional projections ? Do you, in last analysis, give your own flesh and blood as good advice as I give some random Internet chick ? Do you ?
And before you start with the usual bullshit : a) a job is not for to enjoy, a job is for to get all the stuff you don't enjoy in the same room and wall it off. You believe this. She can pursue her whatever the fuck AFTER working hours, with the MONEY those working hours provide. Right ? So cut the bullshit and make her^H^H^H^H^H^H stop getting in the way of her going naked to school this year. Know any better NY resolutions ?">xvi</a></sup> there you sit wondering. whatcher waitin' for ?!</p>
<p><b>Her</b> I am young, so naive is easy to say coming from a 38 year old.. It seems like a 'comfortable' perspective to me.<sup><a href="#footnote_16_64454" id="identifier_16_64454" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Judging by the way I sting people, I expect any day now I'll look in the mirror and there'll be - no hair left, just a swarming nest of vipers.
But you'll still think I'm pretty, right ? Right ?!">xvii</a></sup></p>
<p><b>You</b> i guess that's true. anyway. what do you do for a living as it is ?<br />
<b>Her</b> I am a baker. And I generally cook and/or manage households professionally.<br />
3:01pm</p>
<p><b>You</b> you got the patience to spend the next fifteen minutes answering pointed questions ?<br />
<b>Her</b> Not that I am all too interested in talking about my 'career path'. I don't mind at all, necessarily. I may or may not be interested, but feel free to send them.</p>
<p><b>You</b> alright, bear with me and i promise some sort of result. at the end.<br />
<b>Her</b> That's all that you can promise.</p>
<p><b>You</b> did you go to school ? what kind ?<br />
<b>Her</b> I have gone to 'school' as far as my compulsory education and some college classes. I want to get a degree in a foreign country. I am not interested in the American education system. Right now, I am learning homesteading and working on religious, cultural, and language studies, at home..among many other things.</p>
<p><b>You</b> o.O what's the matter with the ustardian education system in your view ?<br />
<b>Her</b> I don't want to continue the 'compulsory' aspects of study, insofar as completing many courses that have nothing to do what with what I am interested in learning. In American college, one has to complete a solid two years of academic course structure which pertains to many subjects that are 'basic'..mathematics, history, science, etc. Many of these classes have absolutely nothing to do with psychology, for instance. Whereas, if I study abroad, I can jump into my 'major'. I can begin psychology courses during my very first semester.</p>
<p><b>You</b> hm. this is delicious but for the sake of keeping some focus towards my 15 minutes and the incumbent promiose, lets' move on. how did you get the idea dommes make dough ?<br />
<b>Her</b> This would result in achievement of my goal in a much faster, and more fundamental way. By researching the idea.</p>
<p><b>You</b> you mean on the web ?<br />
<b>Her</b> I am also connected to a physical network of people that practice BDSM, which is originally how I was exposed to the idea.</p>
<p><b>You</b> any actual dommes making actual dough in that network that you've seen ?<br />
<b>Her</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>You</b> are they unwilling or unable to apprentice you ?<br />
<b>Her</b> I now live three hours away from this network, but I think that they would be.</p>
<p><b>You</b> so what are you waiting for ? to explain your problem to yourself : do you have nudes published anywhere ?<br />
<b>Her</b> I am not "waiting" on anything.<sup><a href="#footnote_17_64454" id="identifier_17_64454" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Ahh, the eternal delusion of the lively intelligence - that it's not postponing living. Yes, yes it is.
Yes, yes you are.
Here's the scoop : it's true that in knowledge you can not get to one thing until you've got the other. It even happens in this conversation. Nevertheless - this is important, NEVERTHELESS - this never happens in life. Never. Not ever. There's nothing you ever need in order to do anything. You don't need money to have kids, as the chief and perhaps most obvious example. There are no prerequisites to action - prerequisites exist in the realm of thought and there only.">xviii</a></sup> This field of making money is something that I am mildly intrigued with for the time being.</p>
<p><b>You</b> do you see what i mean ?<br />
<b>Her</b> Do you see what I mean, I wonder?</p>
<p><b>You</b> tell me like i were a man. ie, dumb as a sack of bricks.<br />
<b>Her</b> But if you are trying to motivate me, I am not going to discard whatever you have to pass on to me.<sup><a href="#footnote_18_64454" id="identifier_18_64454" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="It's not true that flattery will get you anywhere. Flattery will get you everywhere you don't really want to go.
Humility, however, will get you anywhere. And this is exactly humility, personified in the female mechanism : `I have but one egg and there's endless sperms - nevertheless, if you give me some I'll see to it that they get the same running out all the others do`. This fundamental mechanism is why the human species is still around.
I understand that you may have had a different notion of what humility means. You were wrong.">xix</a></sup> I don't know how willing I am to devote myself to learning the artform/money-making exploration. At this time, it has not been my<br />
priority to learn.</p>
<p><b>You</b> what makes you think it's up to you ?<br />
<b>Her</b> In what regard? (What do you mean?)</p>
<p><b>You</b> what makes you think it's up to you to decide how willing you are to learn x.<br />
<b>Her</b> I have decided that I am accountable and responsible for the choices that I make in life regarding this kind of a thing. There are many things that I do not think are 'up to me'. But that isn't easy to explain.</p>
<p><b>You</b> see, to get back to the earlier thread - you're right that us education is a path to dementia. you are however wrong as to the mechanism. it's not because they make you learn math or other basics. it's because they teach you pure insanity : this delusional notion that you have any choice with regards to what to learn. you may decide what is important. you may not decide HOW it works.<br />
<b>Her</b> That's an interesting concept. What do you mean, how it works?  I agree that many things in this life are pure insanity.</p>
<p><b>You</b> alright, so back to the question : have you published nude photos of yourself ?<br />
<b>Her</b> No</p>
<p><b>You</b> and why not ?<br />
<b>Her</b> Nothing that I have done of that nature is public. Again, I have not ventured into that avenue a whole lot. My putting that on my profile was kind of a joke, in the sense that it was sort of a 'wild card' to see what kind of response I would achieve. Why are you so interested to know? I am very interested to know about the insanity that you perceive. I wonder how much we feel similarly about the world around us.</p>
<p><b>You</b> yes, but the situation tells me that your mental process is broken. if you had a good reason not to publish them, that same good reason would have blocked off working as a domme for you. the fact that it doesn't means that you probably SHOULD have published. do you know enough math to know what sorting trees are ?</p>
<p><b>Her</b> I do not know what a sorting tree is. </p>
<p><b>You</b> ok, let's leave that with the mention that the only time not wasted in this life is the time spent talking to women and learning math.<br />
<b>Her</b> How can you honestly say, that the two would be for the same good reason. One can become a professional domme without publishing public nude pictures of oneself.</p>
<p><b>You</b> o really ? how the fuck does that work.<sup><a href="#footnote_19_64454" id="identifier_19_64454" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="It's not that `how would the clients find you`.

<p>Come to this point you will probably wish to attribute the difference to anything and everything under the sun, "personality", "intelligence", you'll probably claim the height differential between the two is the driver of behavioural difference before you accept the unthinkable horror that really, it's simply the age.</p>
<p>And yet... neither "personality" nor "intelligence" - however you might define them - change much through one's life, and if they do change it's not for the worse (right ?). Nevertheless love ends and happilly married husbands decide they've had enough of their spouses and move on to... to what do they move on ? Girls with better personalities, right ? Smarter women. Taller chicks. That's what they go for, never younger sluts.</p>
<p>It's the age.</p>
<p>It's the age, that <em>fugit interea, singula dum capti circumvectamur amore</em>, as seen in a desire for security, and in a thousand other tiny markings. Can you circumvent the traps your own love of detail sets out for you ? Perhaps, as a slave. Perhaps, if well trained. Naturally ?</p>
<p>Naturally, no. As your mother made you, your chances to age well are comparable to your chances to cure yourself of polio through purely organic means. Supposedly it can happen.</p>

<p>Hey MirceaPopescu,<br />
We just detected that youâ€™re now among the most attractive people on<br />
OkCupid. We learned this from clicks to your profile and reactions to you<br />
in Quickmatch. Did you get a new haircut or something? Well, itâ€™s<br />
working!</p>
<p>To celebrate, weâ€™ve adjusted your OkCupid experience:</p>
<p>********************************************************<br />
*  Youâ€™ll see more attractive people in your results.  *<br />
********************************************************</p>
<p>This wonâ€™t affect your match percentages, which are still based purely<br />
on your answers and desired matchâ€™s answers. But weâ€™ll recommend more<br />
attractive people to you. Youâ€™ll also appear more often to other<br />
attractive people.</p>
<p>Sign in to see your newly-shuffled matches. Have fun, and donâ€™t let this<br />
go to your head.</p></blockquote>
<p>Totally, I got a new haircut. I call it the sed.</p>
<p>But imagine this wonder, if you will! I'm supposed to believe they've been keeping all the hot sluts hidden, because totally, this makes absolute sense if you're running a webservice. I suppose next Amazon's rolling out a "hey, here's all the good stuff we weren't showing you before, not like we're actually in the business of making volume", and the doctor's gonna go "Oh, you're a friend of John's ? Well <em>in that case</em> I got real medicine for you. Everyone else I'm giving tic-tacs."</p>
<p>And yet you <em>knew it</em> <a href=http://trilema.com/forum-logs-for-31-dec-2015#1971573>all along</a>, didn't you ?</p>
<p>Anyway, the point being : even ex-Home Shopping Network IAC/InterActive fucking fell for it. As a friend put it "wow, the best scammers in the world - they could scam anyone" and yet <em>still</em> fucking fell for it. What chances do you have ?

<blockquote><p>Is OkCupid showing me less attractive people on purpose? Every time I log on to OkCupid online or using the Android app it seems as though I am only being showed the "less attractive people" I spend countless minutes of time looking but I never find one person I am attracted to. I noticed that a lot of the people it shows are really large; not too many skinny people, people making ugly duck faces or similar, etc. I even have it set to anywhere in search results. I should also like to point out that I asked a friend to look at matches with me and even he says most of them are un attractive. I read somewhere that this may be on purpose and if it is that makes me mad. Any thoughts anyone?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Sorry if this is in the FAQ/Wiki but I didn't see it there.</p>
<p>I remember reading a couple of years ago that if you were deemed ugly by OKCupid (not sure how this happens - periodic mod review? Lots of low star ratings?) you would not see attractive people in your search results.</p>
<p>I have one photo up that doesn't show much, just a silhouette. Pretty much every one in my search results is a trainwreck. I'm wondering if I am being submitted to this policy.</p></blockquote>
