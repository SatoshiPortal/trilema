		<description>You're not mistaken.

I can't be arsed to awk specifically, but somewhere in the three to five million range for that day. I'm guessing the entire combined rest of "the internet" (or whatever's left of it) doesn't amount to that much. Certainly by the looks of that thing you give as an example they weren't in much danger of touching a call a second or anything like it.

In other news, similarweb is now SMWB (on NASDAQ -- trading around 20 bucks on ~0 volume) so... who knows, maybe it's not &lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2021/i-cant-remember-the-last-time-i-talked-to-a-dude/"&gt;an ice age&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe it's just what's-his-face doesn't know his business or whatever.</description>

		<description>By the way: the venerable traffic.alexa.com/graph?y=t&#38;u=sitename graphical endpoint (as seen in your first graph, the 2nd one is 1y DJIA on that date, unless I'm mistaken) has been retired ever since the day after you added it to the inbound subdomain, ten days ago. In fact &lt;a href="https://archive.is/nf8WX"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; might be the last snapshot of it live anywhere. 

What a coincidence! And a pity, too. That thing has been around for at least ten, more like twenty years. It was always there behind the &lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2011/ce-comemoram-miine/"&gt;hopes and dreams&lt;/a&gt;, part of the skyline of the web, then of the web2.0. Plenty of sites are left broken ever since, of course (&lt;a href="https://archive.is/P4j4q#selection-602.0-460.26"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;) though as there is no real replacement I don't think that'll will ever get fixed.

I wanted to ask: how many calls would that have been, as a rough estimate?

I ask because that way we can find out how much it takes to break the back of Alexa, &lt;b&gt;an Amazon subsidiary&lt;/b&gt;. You know, Amazon, the server space providers.</description>
