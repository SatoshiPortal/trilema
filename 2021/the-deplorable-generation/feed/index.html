		<description>I don't see the relation. 

Rather the problem simply is that any democratic system is deeply, indefensibly vulnerable, and always to the same attacks. The sophists sooner or later figure out how to "make everyone a king" : "hey, people with hairy nostrils, if you ganged together and acted stupidly in concert you'd probably get some meaninglessly idiotic outcome you could misrepresent as a promise for future glory -- it worked for the faggots!!!" 

It's always sold the same way, like the pink pills : cheap communalism ("for everyone!") + manufactured example ("it works!!"). The results of the overlap of their efforts is predictably a bunch of imaginary "groups" (more numerous than the headcount of the population) crying out for... "a strong leader" and then there you go, democracy --&gt; tyranny. Not like this didn't happen before ; indeed &lt;em&gt;nothing else&lt;/em&gt; ever happened before, democracy's for good reason regarded as the most idiotic state of affairs &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

		<description>Grouping people thus inappropriately seems like a misunderstanding of definition via proximate genus and specific difference as &lt;i&gt;approximate genus&lt;/i&gt; and etc, a "close enough" in lieu of correct identification.

Or maybe I just think this because I've...heard it before.</description>

		<description>PS. It should probably be pointed out that the quoted imaginary female does indeed mark the distinction. She doesn't stand as an object, or a representative of female thought objectified, but as an example of a woman trying her best to deal with the female in her head -- and in everyone else's bodies all around.</description>
