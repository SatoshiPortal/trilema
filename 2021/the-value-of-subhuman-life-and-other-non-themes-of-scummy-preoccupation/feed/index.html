		<description>&#62;Speaking of which, Hannah told me the lulziest story on this topic yesterday, mayhaps she is 
&#62;amenable to recounting it as commentary.

Sure; I went with the bimbo yesterday to get the e-class washed, and in the little waiting room we decided to check out the g-class. Specifically I wanted some data on average lifespan as I was telling her I'd seen one for private sale that looked good in all respects except for having ~500k kilometers clocked, which seemed rather beyond the pale.

So I searched for a choice salad of keywords and we swam through some inconsequential nonsense about "how luxurious" and "who drives" and so forth, and even managed to find some research abstract proposing to compare engine longevity (but its graphs, little wonder, at no point used engine or car models on either axis). 

At which point the bimbo told me she thought my search terms were "too eloquent for google". Mockingly, I typed in "bitch how many miles put on that there g wagon wut" and hit enter, and lo and behold I was served with plenty of actually potentially useful hits, a la reviews at car and driver. 

Also, ~fifteen years of life in "Silicon Valley" lets me relate that Anon's quoted list above is idiosyncratic hogwash with two exceptions: the mexican food does suck, and highway 1 is &lt;i&gt;awesome&lt;/i&gt;.</description>
