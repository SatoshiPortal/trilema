<p>I mean, I'm sure it must've been sometime last year, rationally proceeding upon the <del>hidden</del> midden of history. Nevertheless... I just can't remember it. I'm not putting it on anyone, it's mine and I own it, poor memory on my part, it happens (especially with age). I'm not saying it's because they didn't have anything intelligent (or at the very least interesting) to say so reliably an' sustainedly it eventually came to where the volume got turned down by degrees to zero, and then eventually the speaker unplugged to be used somewhere else, as a counterweight perhaps, because it was just collecting dust anyways.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Paladin Press closed down (with the sudden &#038; unexpected death of its owner, coupla years ago), the sultan of Oman<sup><a href="#footnote_0_99066" id="identifier_0_99066" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="You remember, I'm sure, the Qaboos dude whom `mercenaries` and other `supreme gentlemen` of the early MAGA / 1970s sustained through an insurgency against his father and then through a communist insurgency against himself, pretty much the last time in history US-born &#038; Ioway-corn fed dudes about town actually amounted to anything in practice. They did ok in WW1 (not great, but ok) under the supervision of their own government. Then they did miserably enough in WW2 (about on par with the Italians, dicking back and forth over Sicily pretty much, lawd's mercy) s'as to make sure there ain't ever gonna be another one (because, as every owner knows, you don't send your mutt to competitions it ain't gonna win just to burn the gas on the trip). Then they showed themselves marginal in Rhodesia and actually won something in Oman, under private management (meaning : in greatly reduced numbers, imposed by having to select among the `available resources` consisting of 99.x% pure shit). And then... that was it, if you don't mean `leading the coalition that conquered Mosul`, of course, kekekex. 
Because in any fair an' balanced reckoning that's the history of the shithole, unavoidably : America went from
about 80% of adolescent males worth, if not nearly as much as a Prussian, then still just about on par with an Austro-Hungarian (though not really the Hungarian side)
 back in 1915 to
about 50% of adolescent males still worth a residual nonzero something, about on par with the Italians and other African nations (excepting Eritrea), well under the French even, not to mention of course the Brits, Poles, Colonials, Romanians, Hungarians, Serbo-Croatians and other maniacs, Germans, Soviets, Japanese or Fins (in that order)
 back in 1940, to finally
less than 1% of adolescent males worth anything at all, they barely got enough gut to make a native
 after yet another quarter century, so by 1965. Ok, American ?">i</a></sup> also died (just as suddenly &#038; unexpectedly I guess, though he had been in charge for a fucking half century, how long are these misfortunates required to hang on already ?), leaving behind... well, he had no children, so he invested the succession in the royal court. Seriously, he told all those dorks, I don't know them <a href="http://trilema.com/2014/how-the-other-half-lives-or-michael-o-church-is-a-scummy-fuckwit/">but I can imagine</a>, to pick whoever they want.

He also had the presence of spirits (not to mention the knowledge of the working material) to hide a letter indicating whom to pick -- which they did, the very next day. </p>
<p>Imagine these fuckwits an' fucktards! Uppity enough to block each other on one hand, bureaucrats of sufficient ambitions <em>on paper</em> to "I don't see why it shouldn't be me!" -- but only for as long as behind the safety glass of the clucker.

For as long as the discussion's online and every dog's a sultan, then every dog's a sultan an' there's NO WAY TO CONVINCE ANYONE OTHERWISE!!!! They got <a href="http://trilema.com/2021/doll-face/?b=some%20lefts&#038;e=too#select">their rights</a> an' things, they know!

And once it's not daydreaming anymore but doing instead... well... let's see what's on Netflix.</p>
<p>Ultimately I suppose the point is that there ain't anything to talk to dudes <em>about</em>. They're utterly derealised, so it's not like they'll ever have anything meaningful -- let alone interesting -- to say about the world. Not even to the most basic level of "<a href="http://trilema.com/2017/fake-news-are-just-one-tail-of-the-failed-female-state/">go down two blocks and make the next left</a>" or anything<sup><a href="#footnote_2_99066" id="identifier_2_99066" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="In a most amusing application of this, a waiter at some place I frequent very excitedly approached me a coupla days ago to tell me all about this great club he's found (this is something I welcome) where there's oodlebunches of hotties and what a great time he's had with his gal there and I absolutely gotta check it out (by now it was getting suspicious, we're not that close) ; only for it to turn out upon examination that `the club` consists entirely of yet another dork who can't answer his phone (too much pressure!) and otherwise the oodlebunches &#038; great timehaving etcetera is basically the waiter's wife looking for someone to eat her out.

It's not just me doing it, the vast majority of police-citizenry interactions I've to date observed begin with `Disculpe amigo` and end with `tres a la derecha` (or izquierda or dos or whatever the case may be). So basically, getting the dudes involved to any degree is outright work, like elevating grain or moving earth. The only difference's that here they pay the dudes to do the very basics of realisation (giving directions, it requires some degree of presence in actual ontology) ; whereas over there they pay caretakers to pretend like some sort of realisation's somehow ongoing (somewhere else, just over the horizon) -- because, I suppose, the autism's so advanced over there, any real approach's doomed from the start by the laws of large numbers, leaving only idle pretense as an open avenue. It's just a guess, don't bite me.
