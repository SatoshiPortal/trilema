		<description>But essential for whom ?

Nothing's essential, culture's like the marxist dreamworld, everything's got more substitutes than anyone's inclined to count.</description>

		<description>Ubu Roi is still in "should" rather'n "did", and I imagine I'll have to revisit all this after that and I guess Strauss are properly digested.

You ever think about making an "essential" category, btw (have I asked this fifty times already?)?</description>

		<description>All arts, from literature to any &lt;em&gt;aesthetic&lt;/em&gt; pursuit are fundamentally and inescapably escapist ; attempts to culturalize literature (or the arts more generally), known among the savages as "tendency in art" or "art with moral values" necessarily run into &lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2020/how-to-make-your-very-own-girlniture-very-old-fords-and-other-thighs/?b=such%20is&#038;e=literature#select"&gt;the Jarry objection&lt;/a&gt;. (Did you read Ubu Roi btw ?)

Yes tendentious literature can very much still be literature (though it's not literature for being tendentious -- it's tendentious for being tendentious, and literature for being literature) ; otherwise tendentious pieces &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; the most cultural, in the sense the others aren't &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; cultural ; but on one hand culture has the overarching capacity to repurpose, re-appropriate and reinterpret anything in cultural terms -- so purely acultural art objects may survive briefly on the first pass ; but otherwise will either be forgotten or &lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2013/what-is-art/"&gt;cultured&lt;/a&gt; -- and on the other hand there's nothing true or best involved in any of this.

Cannibalism is a consummatedly cultural act, which is why you heard about it from the cultural productions of the people managing the killing of the "savages". Outside of those preoccupations of the Spanish the practice scarcely exists, and certainly is neither familiar nor interesting to the natives.</description>

		<description>Well that certainly helps with concreteness, thanks. To move back up from my own request a little, then: what implications does this have for say literature and the plastic arts? Are paintings with a momento mori bent the true/best/most cultural paintings, making mere pastoral scenes escapism?

Seemingly out of nowhere, this also makes cannibalism interesting all over again --how to tell if a cannibal has, through his killing, involved culture?</description>
