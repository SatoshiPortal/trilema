<p>"Man, look at that!"<br />
"What ?"<br />
"How do they grow tits like that ? I don't get it, I really don't get it."<br />
"You know she's about fifteen, yeah ?"<br />
"Sounds about right. Let's go."<br />
"What ?!"<br />
"We gotta pick her up."<br />
"Are you out of your fucking mind ?!"<br />
"She's soliciting, ain't she ?"<br />
"Soliciting what ?"<br />
"Is this your first day or something ?"<br />
"No, but..."<br />
"Then get with the program, what the fuck."</p>
<p>"Hello miss."<br />
"Um... hi ?!"<br />
"I'm going to need to see some ID."<br />
"What ? Why! I'm not doing nuttin!"<br />
"Be that as it may."<br />
"Seriously officer, I'm totally just minding my own business. I'm on my way home."<br />
"Look here miss, we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the hard way. Now which is it going to be ?"<br />
"I... I mean..."<br />
"Do you have ID ?"<br />
"Here."<br />
"Rachel Mclure, age 15."<br />
"I'll be 16 in June."<br />
"You mean next year ?"<br />
"Yeah..."<br />
"Did you know solicitation of prostitution is a crime in this state ?"<br />
"What ? What do you mean!"<br />
"You're under arrest. Anything you say may or will be used against you in a court of law."<br />
"What is this!"<br />
"Just get in the car."<br />
"But I didn't do anything, for real. I was just walking home. What the..."</p>
<p>"The fuck was the point of that ?"<br />
"What ?"<br />
"She'll get probation, at the most."<br />
"Nah. Pre-trial diversion. The DA knows the score."<br />
"Why even bother ? Besides, they'll call the parents..."<br />
"They'll try to. My bet is the parents won't pick up."<br />
"Why not ?"<br />
"I don't know, maybe they're out. Or it might be the clerk dials the wrong number or something. Mistakes happen."<br />
"So what now ?"<br />
"Now we book her and let the system do its thing so her real life can really begin. You've never been on vice before ?"<br />
"Homeland Security."<br />
"Oh. Brother. So you're one of the cool guys keeping our borders safe, huh ?"<br />
"Yeah. Right."<br />
"Man, you've got to get me in there. I could do with some new gizmos and shit."<br />
"That's what you heard, huh ?"<br />
"That's right."<br />
"Used to be like that. Not anymore."<br />
"They killed the goose ?"<br />
"Pretty much. Just red tape and turning rocks over to paint 'em white now, it's no better than social security. Longer hours, too."<br />
"Damn."<br />
"Maybe the folks on that wall are doing better, it being new and all, I don't know. But by and large..."<br />
"What a gyp."<br />
"So you gonna give me the low-down or what ?"<br />
"Not unless you ask."<br />
"I'm askin', aint I ?"<br />
"Look man, vice is easy-peasy. What you do all day is go around where the young sluts are. They gotta go to school so that's a good start, just drive around two-three blocks from one. Then you stop 'em, you haul 'em and you book 'em. That's pretty much it."<br />
"Then what ?"<br />
"Are you Internal or something ?"<br />
"Man..."<br />
"Like I give a fuck. Then they book her, means she goes into the holding pen. Whores get a single open space, there's at least twenty seats and fifty whores to the twenty seats on a slow day. They all got <a href="http://trilema.com/2020/pimp-by-robert-beck-aka-iceberg-slim-adnotated-without-permission-chapter-6-drilling-for-oil/?b=You%20see%20a%20young%20girl&#038;e=square%20or%20whore#select">pimps</a>, sooner or later your collar will turn up somewhere. Most pay a bitcent a head, and of course there's free lay all the way."<br />
"Oh. Wow."<br />
"Yeah, it's pretty smooth riding."<br />
"Man, that sounds like good money."<br />
"Top man on the squad made a hundred twelve collars, <em>last week</em>."<br />
"A week ?!"<br />
"Fine bitches, too. You should see that dude's rooster, Playboy ain't got nothing on him."<br />
"Could go into business for himself."<br />
"Haha, nah. Too much hassle, too little payoff. Better behind the shield."<br />
"I guess you said a mouthfull there."</p>
<p>"Good morning boys. What can I do ye fer ?"<br />
"Eighty-eight-sixty. Rachel, Mclure. Age 15."<br />
"I didn't do anything!"<br />
"Shut up, you!"<br />
"Alright, sign here."<br />
"See you later, Charlie."<br />
"Yeah. To holding."<br />
"No, please. Wait, I don't..."<br />
"If you don't shut up you're going to accidentally hit something, pumpkin."</p>
<p>"Whooo hooo!"<br />
"Look at that!"<br />
"Hi baby!"<br />
"She in here boss ?"<br />
"That's right."<br />
"Wooo! WOOOO!"<br />
"Come right in, pretty titties."<br />
"Help me! Please..."<br />
"Shut up. It's what you wanted for yourself, innit."<br />
"No, no. I... please..."<br />
"Well, you'd better wanted it, cuz now you got it."<br />
"Oh my god!"<br />
"Hey boss, she can't come in here like that."<br />
"She a first timer, ain't she ?"<br />
"Damn right!"<br />
"Fine bitch not even a real ho."<br />
"Take it off, bitch!"<br />
"Shut up, you dumb whores. You're scaring her."<br />
"Yes boss."<br />
"Shut up everyone. Let the boss man do his thang."<br />
"I love it when he does his thang!"<br />
"You want them to go easy on you, pumpkin ?"<br />
"I... I mean... Yes."<br />
"Then here's what you do. First, you take those sneakers off, <a href="http://trilema.com/2013/compliance/?b=socks&#038;e=shoes#select">let's see</a> what kinda socks your mommy put on your pwetty wittwe feets this morning."<br />
"Wooo hooooo!"<br />

"I..."<br />
"That's a good girl. And how pretty you look in those ankle socks. Are those icecream cones ?"<br />
"Y..eah."<br />
"That's good, cuz you'll be doing a whoooole lotta lickin'"<br />

"How yo hair so light, ho ?!"<br />
"Now shake your ass, like you saw on the Internet. You keep up with the Internet don't you ? That's a good girl."<br />
