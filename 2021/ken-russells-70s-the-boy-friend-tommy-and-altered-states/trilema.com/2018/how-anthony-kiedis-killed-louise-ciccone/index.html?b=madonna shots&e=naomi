<p><font color=pink>slut</font> love american style. jokes my folks never told me.<sup><a href="#footnote_0_81240" id="identifier_0_81240" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Figure here because they were mentioned in a book I borrowed from [a different] girl. It's a ghostwritten `autobiography` of one Anthony Kiedis, and it includes the following phrase verbatim : 
Roger Corman was doing a triple-R-rated version of Love American Style called Jokes My Folks Never Told Me. It was the quintessential '70s flick with beautiful naked women throughout.
Yes there exists such a thing as the 70s flick with beautiful naked women throughout. It's spoken in Italian, even when dubbed in English (seriously now, look for the scenes they left behind). 
Back in the day I was actually doing porn I was still the same person, and I still did my research. Roger Corman didn't figure anywhere in the line-up, much like the United States didn't figure anywhere in the line-up. The competition was Swiss not fucking Detroit, and the pretense that our culturally-irrelevant colonies fucking existed in the 70s strikes my memory of the 80s and 90s veheheheeery oddly indeed. 
Just look at something like `Naked Paradise` : a pointedly not naked film about pointedly no nudity. This, this is what the ameritards were all about, then as now : putting a little petrocheese in a box on which some farmhand had ineptly scratched `Fringh Cheezzque, esq.` and then eating it in silence around the camp fire, quietly pretending their failure is somehow `ironic`, and therefore not entirely descriptive of them, of their capacities, potential and human value. Except for the occasional `panics` (what drunks commonly refer to as `moments of clarity`), the American tradition from Samuel Clemens to Barrack Obama consists very much of this `put the dung in the empty metal can and then smoke it as if` dealio and entirely nothing else.
Meanwhile I am rich and powerful and the women run ample circles around me organizing the detritus of the-world-in-general according to my own hierarchies. Bitch stands ready to produce the sensible forms of named fiction, if I only say the word. Spoiler : I'm not fucking gonna. Not this time.">i</a></sup><br />
<b>Me</b> ty!</p>

<p><font color=pink>slut</font> 8.8gb torrent, coupla seeders<br />

<b>Me</b> "The Odd Couple, formally titled onscreen Neil Simon's<sup><a href="#footnote_1_81240" id="identifier_1_81240" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="You understand ?
There's a Vice documentary about `24/7 slavery` and `total power exchange` and stuff. Guess what's missing from it.
Guess what's missing from the cases of `French` wine sold in the US, guess what's missing from the Ann Arbor version of Piaget, guess, guess, guess. Nomina nuda, all they're interested in -- and as price is a factor, they tend to get the empty boxes dumped on their sorry ass. Wut do ?!
Easy listening, easy living, easily defeated schmucks.">ii</a></sup> The Odd Couple, is an American television situation comedy broadcast from September 24, 1970, to March 7, 1975, on ABC. It stars Tony Randall as Felix Unger and Jack Klugman as Oscar Madison, and was the first of several sitcoms developed by Garry Marshall for Paramount Television."<br />
<b>Me</b> idiots.</p>
<p><font color=pink>slut</font> can you picture how much it sucks?<br />
<b>Me</b> yes. this guy's bio<sup><a href="#footnote_2_81240" id="identifier_2_81240" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Kiedis was, you realise, the front man for Red Hot Chilli Peppers.
In it, `he` says, literally, the following : 
During that summer of 1981, heroin hadn't become prominent on the drug scene.
He says this, I'm not making it fucking up. Take a moment to come back, and think about it : what is the value in reading the `biography` of a moron stuck so far up his own ass ? 
You'd think Blondie is about half the music his band ever listen to, yet the entirety of his discussion of Blondie is how he proposed marriage to the woman one day. That's it. His two paragraphs about what a big deal Kelvyn Bell was to him consist of his saying what a big deal the dood was. To him. That. Is. It. Here : 
It was Donde's birthday, so we dropped some acid and went to Tracks to see John Lurie and the Lounge Lizzards, then to the Bottom Line to take in Arthur Blythe. To our amazement, Blythe had Kelvyn Bell, the great guitar player from Defunkt, playing with him. The show was incredible, and after it was over, I went to the bar and talked to Kelvyn about music and about his guitar playing and the records that I knew he'd played on. He was very happy to engage about music with this eighteen-year-old* boy from Hollywood who was blazing on acid.
This is fucking it, and that's all. They `talked about music` after a show that was `incredible`. When I say Elliot is the icon of all UStards you think I'm engaging in rhetorical flourish -- but no such thing. As `MeanStreet`, whatever that is, informs us on the cover, `If there ever lived a guy with enough material to fill an irresistible tell-all biography, it's Red Hot Chilli Peppers frontman Anthony Kiedis.` Irresistible, yes ? Tell-all, ok ? Tell the fuck what! What ?! What have I been told ? What fucking material ?! WHERE IS IT ?!

* The issue this 2004 book has with ustardian ageisms... Every single fucking chick in there is 18, including the teenyboppers his father was drugfucking in the 70s, because totally, that's how it worked, and they were so not 15...
This item appears to have been penned by a mediocre junior high student for class assignment in Wisconsin somewhere, what can I say. It certainly manifests all the avatars of unreflective dullness, in any case.">iii</a></sup> single handedly killed a whole swathe of post-rock rock for me.<br />
<b>Me</b> not just his stupid fucking band, but any kind of intellectual respectability mtv might've built for the crowd.<br />
<b>Me</b> eg these days i find it quite fucking impossible to not see madonna as the bimbo sees her, though at some point i thought she was moderately cool. and i can't think red hot chilli peppers and not think omfg elevator music<br />
<b>Me</b> though at some point...<sup><a href="#footnote_3_81240" id="identifier_3_81240" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="That point being as close as a few days ago, when we discussed the band in the same format and I said something like `it seemed to musically render the southern Californian desert` and she was kinda meh.">iv</a></sup> and so following.</p>
<p><font color=pink>slut</font> no idea why your opinion of madonna dropped.<br />
<b>Me</b> what's she done ? if i had to answer this q, what do i say ?<br />
<b>Me</b> "she was in <a href=http://trilema.com/2012/dick-tracy>that thing</a> with <a href=http://trilema.com/2012/shampoo/>that schmuck i can't stand</a>" ?</p>
<p><font color=pink>slut</font> she's made like forty fucking albums is what she's done, and photobooks with black on white girl shots, and so forth.<br />
<font color=pink>slut</font> for her entire life. for until they forcibly remove her from it.<br />
<font color=pink>slut</font> and it still doesn't sound like shit after 40+ years<br />
<b>Me</b> and married guy ritchie, right</p>
<p><font color=pink>slut</font> so the fuck what, she married him when he was good, she divorced him when he sucked.<br />
<b>Me</b> so is the idea like count ? aerosmith also made 40+ albums in 40+ years of heavy drug use. and i similarily thought a lot of them, coupla decades ago</p>
<p><font color=pink>slut</font> count is part, not all, of it.<br />
<b>Me</b> but i can't find much meaning in any of it, looking now. </p>
<p><font color=pink>slut</font> aerosmith sold out to ben affleck bs<br />
<font color=pink>slut</font> madonna did not.<br />
<b>Me</b> it's just... wank. "love in an elevator, loving it up till it's going down" ?</p>
<p><font color=pink>slut</font> so never listen to anything but bach again, what can i tell you.<br />
<b>Me</b> i have this humongo library of lyrics in my head, and it's all fucking terrible.<br />
<b>Me</b> all the <span style="background-color:#d3d3d3" id="select">madonna shots with naomi</span> have to be re-shot. have you seen them ?!</p>
<p><font color=pink>slut</font> i'm sure i have. why do they have to be re-shot?<br />
<b>Me</b> what am i looking at <a href=http://trilema.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/madonna-1.jpg>here</a> ?<br />
<b>Me</b> is this an advertisement for polka dots ?<br />
<b>Me</b> or for bovine males in the background ?</p>
<p><font color=pink>slut</font> so never listen to anything but bach again, what can i tell you.<br />
<b>Me</b> what THE FUCK <a href="http://trilema.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/madonna-2.jpg">is he wearing</a> ?<br />
<b>Me</b> i can't even disprove the notion that the "wtf, how did you get that, killed a cheetah ?" joke in road trip isn't a disparaging reference.</p>
<p><font color=pink>slut</font> i sure hope there's no lingering typo in your gpg contracts article.<br />
<font color=pink>slut</font> lest future you be all "eh wtf i can't be arsed to even like that guy anymore, wtf daughter"<sup><a href="#footnote_4_81240" id="identifier_4_81240" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Apparently I've at some point decided 'ght' may no longer exist, I've nfi what happened.">v</a></sup><br />
<b>Me</b> do you think the same applies ?<br />
<b>Me</b> in fairness <a href="http://trilema.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/madonna-3.jpg">outtakes</a> way the fuck better than the published material.</p>
<p><font color=pink>slut</font> i think a complaint against a prop's style of underwear in a picture depicting madonna fucking around with naomi campbell published at a time when the pictures themselves and especially their interracial content was "problematic" etc is akin to being hung up on a typo, yes.<br />
<font color=pink>slut</font> maybe he had a disapointing cock and she's sparing you.<br />
<b>Me</b> but see, this is the problem with context dependency. i am not saying that ~shouldn't have been big in the 70s~. i am saying, now that the 70s are dead and dust, i find nothing left there.<br />
<b>Me</b> i find ~plenty~ in the, eg, <a href=http://trilema.com/2013/so-are-they-really-about-to-fuck/>1870s "mothercountry" impressionist painting</a><sup><a href="#footnote_5_81240" id="identifier_5_81240" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="It's really 1880s, but anyways.">vi</a></sup>.</p>
<p><font color=pink>slut</font> when's the last time you actually listened to madonna?<br />
<b>Me</b> current or vintage you mean ?</p>
<p><font color=pink>slut</font> either<br />
<b>Me</b> pretty sure we did a very brief cameo during one of the music fuckarounds we did.<br />
<b>Me</b> not sure that's much "listening".<br />
<b>Me</b> but then -- i've become painfully unmusical lately.</p>
<p><font color=pink>slut</font> ! = actually listened, eh<br />
<font color=pink>slut</font> yeah<br />
<font color=pink>slut</font> well so naturally then!<br />
<b>Me</b> tried leonard cohen.<br />
<b>Me</b> thought he was fucking great, historically</p>
<p><font color=pink>slut</font> no, i agree with you there.<br />
<b>Me</b> terrible.<sup><a href="#footnote_6_81240" id="identifier_6_81240" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This happened over an otherwise pleasant roadtrip : I had prepared a pile of Leonard Cohen albums, for the delight of three Leonard Cohen fans, declared as such.

Can you imagine this, sigh of relief from music ? It can't be fucking music, can it, definitionally it therefore can't be music.

<p><font color=pink>slut</font> he's got 5 - 10 actually great songs. rest of his catalogue is like the long hard discordant road he had to take to get to them.<br />

<b>Me</b> "oh this brick's broken here". sure, it is. but the arch stands<br />
<b>Me</b> i look back and i can't recognize any arch.<br />
<b>Me</b> <a href="http://trilema.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/madonna-4.jpg">this</a> was a big fucking deal. possibly only item that wouldn't need re-shooting, except for the part where it apparently disappeared.<sup><a href="#footnote_7_81240" id="identifier_7_81240" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Thanks god for one's own archives huh.">viii</a></sup></p>
<p><font color=pink>slut</font> well you may have actually looked back in cohen's case, but in the rest?<br />
<b>Me</b> i tried to listen to various rest. iron maiden. aerosmith.<br />
<b>Me</b> all sorts. they sound dumb.</p>
<p><font color=pink>slut</font> why'd you listen to "love in an elevator" to look back at aerosmith? it's dream on, or crazy, for that, obviously.<br />
<b>Me</b> for whom ?<br />

<p><font color=pink>slut</font> iron maiden's dreamchild<sup><a href="#footnote_9_81240" id="identifier_9_81240" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="She means Moonchild and Infinite Dreams, somehow jointly like that.

<p><font color=pink>slut</font> there could be some b-side that you liked because i dunno, it hit the spot this one time in the car or whatever. but obviously that's fleeting.<br />
<font color=pink>slut</font> there are objective besties.<br />
<b>Me</b> because 25 years ago, it was the item that made me think, "hey, maybe these doods have more to say than meets the eye ?".<br />
<b>Me</b> which i suspect is the original promise of music, "there's an enchanted land past the rainbow, alice."<sup><a href="#footnote_10_81240" id="identifier_10_81240" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="It was sure as fucknuts why I cracked open the book that started this discussion. `Hey, maybe this guy's got some shit to say`.">xi</a></sup></p>
<p><font color=pink>slut</font> i dunno. the bands i loved when i was a teenager i love still, even if i like whatever they made afterwards less. smashing pumpkins being a great example, i can't really even listen to whatever they've been doing for the past ten years, but the bridges are still very much intact.<br />
<b>Me</b> but yes, dreamchild still sounded great, musically.<br />
<b>Me</b> sort of thing makes one want a better sound system. which ~never happens to me as it is.</p>
<p><font color=pink>slut</font> and i guarantee you "justify my love" and "lucky star" etc still sound great musically.<br />
<b>Me</b> she was a pop shit, never had ~great musically~. was all image.<br />
<b>Me</b> remember <a href=http://trilema.com/2017/blow-up/>that stupid film</a> with the blond "photographer" kid in london ?</p>

<b>Me</b> "Throughout its run, The Odd Couple was juggled around ABC's programming schedule. The show struggled in the Nielsen ratings and was canceled at the end of every season.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<ol class="footnotes"><li id="footnote_0_81240" class="footnote">Figure here because they were mentioned in a book I borrowed from [a different] girl. It's a ghostwritten "autobiography" of one Anthony Kiedis, and it includes the following phrase verbatim : </p>
<blockquote><p>Roger Corman was doing a triple-R-rated version of Love American Style called Jokes My Folks Never Told Me. It was the quintessential '70s flick with beautiful naked women throughout.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes there exists such a thing as the <a href=http://trilema.com/2013/la-liceale-nella-classe-dei-ripetenti/>70s flick</a> with <a href=http://trilema.com/2016/giro-girotondo-con-il-sesso-e-bello-il-mondo/>beautiful naked</a> women <a href=http://trilema.com/2016/rag-arturo-de-fanti-bancario-precario/>throughout</a>. It's spoken in Italian, <a href=http://trilema.com/2017/salon-kitty-and-lempire-des-sens/#footnote_0_73869>even when dubbed in English</a> (seriously now, look for the scenes they left behind). </p>
<p>Back in the day I was actually doing porn I was still the same person, and I still did my research. Roger Corman didn't figure anywhere in the line-up, much like the United States didn't figure anywhere in the line-up. The competition was Swiss not fucking Detroit, and the pretense that our culturally-irrelevant colonies fucking existed in the 70s strikes my memory of the 80s and 90s veheheheeery oddly indeed. </p>
<p>Just look at something like "Naked Paradise" : a pointedly not naked film about pointedly no nudity. This, <em>this</em> is what the ameritards were <em>all</em> about, then as now : putting a little petrocheese in a box on which some farmhand had ineptly scratched "Fringh Cheezzque, esq." and then eating it in silence around the camp fire, quietly pretending their failure is somehow "ironic", and therefore not entirely descriptive of them, of their capacities, potential and human value. Except for the occasional "panics" (what drunks commonly refer to as "moments of clarity"), the American tradition from Samuel Clemens to Barrack Obama consists very much of this "put the dung in the <a href=http://trilema.com/forum-logs-for-20-sep-2017#2341433>empty metal can</a> and then smoke it <a href=http://trilema.com/forum-logs-for-06-oct-2018#2482605>as if</a>" dealio <em>and entirely nothing else</em>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I am rich and powerful and the women run ample circles around me organizing the detritus of the-world-in-general according to my own hierarchies. Bitch stands ready to produce the sensible forms of named fiction, if I only say the word. Spoiler : I'm not fucking gonna. Not this time.

<p>You'd think Blondie is about half the music his band ever listen to, yet the <em>entirety</em> of his discussion of Blondie is how he proposed marriage to the woman one day. That's <em>it</em>. His two paragraphs about what a big deal Kelvyn Bell was to him consist of his saying what a big deal the dood was. To him. That. Is. It. Here : </p>
<blockquote><p>It was Donde's birthday, so we dropped some acid and went to Tracks to see John Lurie and the Lounge Lizzards, then to the Bottom Line to take in Arthur Blythe. To our amazement, Blythe had Kelvyn Bell, the great guitar player from Defunkt, playing with him. The show was incredible, and after it was over, I went to the bar and talked to Kelvyn about music and about his guitar playing and the records that I knew he'd played on. He was very happy to engage about music with this eighteen-year-old* boy from Hollywood who was blazing on acid.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is fucking it, and that's all. They "talked about music" after a show that was "incredible". When I say <a href=http://trilema.com/2016/the-story-of-elliot-rodger-by-elliot-rodger-adnotated-part-nine/#selection-145.30-145.78>Elliot</a> is the icon of all UStards you think I'm engaging in rhetorical flourish -- but no such thing. As "MeanStreet", whatever that is, informs us on the cover, "If there ever lived a guy with enough material to fill an irresistible tell-all biography, it's Red Hot Chilli Peppers frontman Anthony Kiedis." Irresistible, yes ? Tell-all, ok ? Tell <em>the fuck</em> what! What ?! What have I been told ? What fucking material ?! WHERE IS IT ?!</p>

						<p>I still have a soft spot for Kanye and Bonecrusher (who apparently the Latinos never heard of), but exposure to the Latino "Industria Musica"... So many of the fuckers have one hook, one backing track, and they build careers off of that shit. Then I look back to the home language space with BritneyChain, Mr. Gaga, and the Disney crew which produced many too many names. Disney did how ever make Demi Lovato who is more rock than Keidis by virtue of knowing where the heroin is at, as evidenced by her hospital trips for experimenting with the fine line between living and dead.</p>
<p>Still, fucking Marco Antonio Solis, Christian Castro, and the compost pile of "Is this an album or a single track on repeat." And "lloviendo estrellas" can especially go straight to hell. If I walk out on my South American balcony where I write pieces about the problems of Jews in Germany only to see the stars in the sky raining down, that isn't sweet. That's hellfire Armageddon shit, <a href="http://trilema.com/2018/how-anthony-kiedis-killed-louise-ciccone/#selection-229.0-231.37" >like Ben Affleck.</a></p>

						<p>"the bands i loved when i was a teenager i love still, even if i like whatever they made afterwards less" - is this meant to be a comment on the quality or substance of those bands' music? I tried and tried to read it that way but I just can't see it, regardless of what the bands are - I mean, what, they peaked by accident exactly when she was a teenager?</p>

						<p>It is possible but I find it really unlikely - perhaps it's just me. For one thing I have encountered this precise belief so many times and in so many different contexts that I really can't say it's to do with more than the speaker being a teenager at that time. Basically yes, many people tend to go through life still liking all sorts of things they liked when they were teenagers - usually the least (re)examined the more liked. Perhaps this is not the case at all here but I don't see it.</p>
<p>For another thing, the statement is general (the one named band is given as an example only), without any exception baked in, so *all* of those she liked either peaked at that time or otherwise maintained their level and/or improved. Possible I suppose but rather dubious still.</p>
