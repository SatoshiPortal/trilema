The two terms are otherwise unrelated, save for the <em>happenstance</em> that women were historically born female (at least... preponderently). </p>
<p>Female cows are not women cows, yet they are perfectly capable of "reproduction"<sup><a href="#footnote_1_101645" id="identifier_1_101645" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="In the sense of parturition, id est reproducing themselves ; not in the sense of reproduction id est reproducing `whatever fucks them`. The standard contemplated for this misnomer of a `reproduction` that's mere production self-obviously is that something'll come out at all, and not that anything in particular'll come out whatsoever.

Even were a bioblob genetically engineered capable of reproduction in the strict sense of replication ad idem and limited cognition in the hard sense of Artificial Intelligence, yet still that bioblob, while certainly female, would not necessarily be a woman, nor necessarily any closer to being a woman than any can of deodorant spray or any other byproduct of industrial activity.">iii</a></sup> They're actually sexually receptive, <a href="http://trilema.com/2012/bai-deci-va-rog-sa-mi-spuneti-ca-nu/?b=supt&#038;e=destul#select">after a fashion</a>, in the sense that if you insist enough you might fuck one. Sexual receptivity in this sense also isn't the criteria for womanhood. </p>
<p>Women differentiate (ideally, with <a href="http://trilema.com/2020/the-diary-of-a-baby-doll/?b=She said she is not&#038;e=close#select">help</a> from older women) from the females they were born as, generally at some point during their second decade of life. Whether this occurs early or late within that decade matters little in practice ; but as far as retarded development is concerned the third decade contains a hard biological limit -- much like children who've not learned to speak by twenty likely never will, so human females that haven't womened by thirty likely never will (simiarily, whether children learn to read at five or eight makes relatively little difference, as long as they're actually reading, as a central and self-defining occupation, by the age of ten or so).</p>
<p>What differentiates the woman from the female (or <a href="http://trilema.com/2021/hey-bitches-smell-my-armpits/">the can of deodorant spray</a>) is specific, narrowly defined and narrowly construed self-positioning, as a subjective and subjectively recognized self-defining experience. Just as <a href="http://trilema.com/2014/a-conceit-or-the-importance-of-blogging/?b=in the endless&#038;e=bogs#select">armies recognize bridges</a> they never before seen, just so the woman recognizes herself, in her own view of the world surrounding, which includes herself as a self-perceived image of the self. The little girl looking down on her own naked body and thinking "it looks just like a whore's!" finds herself in the throws of the very process of becoming a woman, by herself and for her own needs ; <del>"society"</del> <a href="http://trilema.com/2018/heres-how-pantsuitism-christianity-ruined-civilisation-in-both-the-ancient-and-the-modern-world/">socialism's</a><sup><a href="#footnote_3_101645" id="identifier_3_101645" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="There is no practical way to distinguish christianity, socialism, and plain idiocy.
