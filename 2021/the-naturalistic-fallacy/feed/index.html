		<description>&lt;a href="http://trilema.com/2016/why-is-that/#comment-117931"&gt;Quite&lt;/a&gt; ; and that's exactly what explains the "difficulty", entirely self-secreted, in learning another language "experienced" (in the sense "the paradox" is experienced here) by they who aged (past 15 or so) on a single language. It "doesn't come natural" because their notions of logic, morals and whatever pragmatic and ethical heuristics have become dried on the structures of the one language they did learn. Much like long-term monogamous derps become socially disfacilitated, often to the point of actual disability, much like windows that should be openable by design but haven't in fact been opened in decades are more likely to fall off their hinges than actually open as intended, the speaker of a single language is apt to confuse the way things are to be said in that language with their actual thoughts.</description>

		<description>So it could be said the mistaking of that paralogy for a paradox is a symptom of something carefully not called "speech thought fallacy", whereby speakers of english as a principal or more often only language confuse the workings of language for the workings of thought?</description>
