The brighter'd be `businessmen`, and strike out `on their own` (kinda-sorta). The rest, working for the government (don't kid yourself) and calling themselves `economists` would... oh, you know, derp importantly. What else ?
Once those same tools started showing a quite different side of the same TRUTH, however, sometime around the 80s... well, they became suddenly not that interesting anymore. Nor are they all that curious about this entire truth thingee any longer -- as it turns out it was over-rated, rather a scam to speak plainly (not in the sense of any relationship to incorporeal ideals, but very much in the sense of its relationship to their corpulent corporeals). Sure, for years and years and long lengthy years they did propose, loudly, yelling at the top of their voice, that everyone else should suck it, because so the truth commands. But now, now that the truth points the other way... well what ? You wouldn't seriously want them to suck it ? Work really hard ? Long hours, no pay, no hope, be just as cheerfully the exploited colony that TRUTH casts them now as ? Hey, they liked this play well enough back when the script called for them to be the prince ; but what is this horsegroom bullshit ?! Yesteryear's truth's now principally UNFAIR, not for any reason than the subsidiary : as it no longer provides the wilful nullity its means to life, as it no longer coats upon its will to power... well what good is it ?! And don't say `it's the truth` either. Lmao, fucking hatefacts!
As far as they're concerned, really the only item you need to take away from this footnote is that they didn't change their story for the exact same reason everyone else didn't like to hear it all through the IMF's `helpful` existence -- but for `different reasons altogether` (and only a hateful blackguard would either ask what those reasons might be, or say the words `austerity` and `America` in the same sentence, aite ?).">vii</a></sup> demands of the "new" society etcetera. </p>
<p>As the impopularity of ye olde Economics grew to match the unbecoming picture Economics were painting of "America" (something looking suspiciously just like "the US"), the ambitious nullity pivoted to taking on college debt while nominally being involved with "Science" (as <a href="http://trilema.com/2017/is-it-still-rape-if-i-write-science-on-my-penis-first/">the religion</a>), an enchanted pile of nonsense that -- fortunately -- does in fact include much less actual math than the modest arithmetics Economics used to require of <a href="http://trilema.com/2013/fried-chicken/">aspirants</a>. Thus a new generation of filth grew up, barely <a href="http://trilema.com/2013/the-disadvantage-of-teaching-people-the-alphabet-and-nothing-more-is-that-you-have-to-somehow-put-up-with-a-bunch-of-retards-that-can-now-express-themselves-in-writing/">alphabetized</a> but just as soaked through in its <a href="http://trilema.com/2010/sunteti-besini/">own farts</a> &#038; delusional self-importance as that regrettable demographic always manages. </p>
<p>They're the New Bureaucrat, "in power" (<a href="http://trilema.com/2017/why-is-fighting-corruption-the-pantsuit-callsign/?b=the%20law&#038;e=apply%20to%20me#select">after a fashion</a>) "everywhere" (kinda-sorta). After slowly building mass &#038; momentum over the course of the past two decades, they recently burst out<sup><a href="#footnote_7_100987" id="identifier_7_100987" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The phenomenon is plainly and directly the result of the younger crowd of leeches wresting control wrt `setting public policy` (ie, stealing from the public treasury) from the older crowd of leeches.">viii</a></sup> onto the stage riding the coat tails of a <a href="http://trilema.com/2017/global-warming-on-triton/">continuation hoax</a> : supposedly a "<a href="http://trilema.com/2020/in-a-transparent-attempt-by-the-man-to-distract-attention-from-the-internal-problems-of-the-republic-by-focusing-it-instead-on-the-lulz-in-africa/">great pandemic</a>" (they call "COVID") is greatly threatening the whole world, and they're gonna save --- everyone. Whether anyone wants to or not, to be saved or otherwise, by them or anyone else, none of that matters anymore, supposedly, because... whatever, they're deranged, these kids. Their life made no sense to them at no point they can remember, and besides, they <em>are</em>. What more ?</p>
<p>This hoax has a number of excellent advantages of the most practical sort<sup><a href="#footnote_8_100987" id="identifier_8_100987" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Think about it, an imaginary viral disease. That doesn't do anything. I mean, it's fucking perfect, they'll believe the amulets saved them and hurray for the new state religion. How's reality to ever get in the way ?">ix</a></sup>, especially from the point of view of a poor but inept and otherwise principally ambitious kid. First of all, by drastically limiting human contact it resolves (in the usual sense of socialist "solutions") their principal macula : even if I don't care what they say, they still "don't have to" feel bad because there's no woman in their house. They're not failures, they're just being "responsible", okay ? It's very important for the loser to have some ideological support for his loseritude, rather than have to confront his own responsibility therein. They don't go to parties not <a href="http://trilema.com/2009/nsfw-topless/?b=intre%20ghior&#038;e=tani#select">because nobody ever wanted them at any party</a>, ok ? <a href="http://trilema.com/2016/%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%88%D0%BD%D0%BE/?b=la%20mare%20e%20naspa&#038;e=octopusi#select">Different reasons altogether</a>!</p>
<p>Similarily in this vein, it's suddenly ok to be poor now, either to the standard of "too poor to go out" (nobody is allowed to!) or anything else. And it's also ok to do a shit job -- sourcing post-surgery garments or mixing a cup of coffee irrespective, it's poorly done or not done at all "because the pandemic". And they don't have to go to work anymore, meaning they don't have to not make the car payments anymore, because what car. So on and ongoing, the "pandemic" hoax offers the very deeply, desperately needed narcissist ego-protection : UStards aren't <a href="http://trilema.com/2012/generatia-fara/">shockingly poor</a>, in the most miserable, mean, hard sense of poverty, just like MP said. Nor was it brought about by their chinny pretense, <a href="http://trilema.com/2015/latino-perspectives/">exactly like for the Argentines</a> -- also <a href="http://trilema.com/2015/argentina-for-business/">just as MP said</a>. No, no, it's not that see, it's just... it's the pandemic.</p>
<p>Now that we understand each other -- there isn't such a thing as this "COVID" bs ; nor "could be" ; nor is the fantasy of its supposed existence predicated on anything besides the ego-protective needs of a poor but pretentious population trying desperately to explain its own newfound poverty to itself in any other terms besides its own, personal, self-descriptive, wholly representative and <em>utterly biological</em> insufficiency, inadequacy and utter failure -- let's amuse ourselves with some truly excellent excursions in involuntary humour : the New Bureaucrat's list of proofs to the contrary!</p>

<p>Well... yeah ? <em>Of course</em> they are. Seeing how they can't invent new corpses they generally repurpose the available ones, which explains how there can be an "epidemic" with no actual increase in mortality ; moreover socialized health care means all hospitals work as government offices : they're paid government scrip and propagate government scripture.

<p>Anyway, that's literally all the "fitness" expert's got. She somehow counted that to six, whatever, arithmetic's over-rated I guess, it <em>felt</em> like six or whatever.</p>

<strong>Pathologist falsely claims COVID-19 is a hoax, no worse than the flu</strong><br />

<p>CLAIM: COVID-19 is “the greatest hoax ever perpetrated” and “just another bad flu.” Roger Hodkinson, a pathologist who identifies himself<sup><a href="#footnote_10_100987" id="identifier_10_100987" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Aaactually...

<p>AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. Not only is COVID-19 deadlier than the flu, but symptoms last longer, according to medical experts. Also, Hodkinson has never been chairman of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada.</p></blockquote>
<p>Right ?</p>
<p>Anyway, there's indeed <em>plenty</em> more where that came from ; just don't expect any of it to have any particular relation to what's claimed on the box. As long as you're okay with reading "proof" as to how the hoax ain't a hoax that's not even remotely anything like proof, they've got plenty, and also pudding (speaking of which, as long as you're willing to buy "clothes" made of synthetic fibers, they got that, also -- and otherwise... mmm...).</p>
<p>The closing of this piece belongs, inescapably, to the unsung victims of crowd delusion : those thousands upon thousands of hapless royal subjects who were <font color=red>murdered</font> in cold blood by doctors putting them on ventilators for no medical reason, merely to follow along with the fashions of the day. Those misfortunates go to join the women similarly murdered by doctors who wouldn't wash their hands some years ago, and a whole choir invisible of other quiet victims of the general propensity of the average idiot to posture importantly.</p>

Nor are they all that curious about this entire truth thingee any longer -- as it turns out it was over-rated, rather a scam to speak plainly (not in the sense of any relationship to incorporeal ideals, but very much in the sense of its relationship to their corpulent corporeals). Sure, for years and years and long lengthy years they did propose, loudly, yelling at the top of their voice, that <em>everyone else</em> should suck it, because so the truth commands. But now, now that the truth points the other way... well what ? You wouldn't seriously want <em>them</em> to suck it ? Work really hard ? Long hours, no pay, no hope, be just as cheerfully the exploited colony that TRUTH casts them now as ? Hey, they liked this play well enough back when the script called for them to be the prince ; but what is this horsegroom bullshit ?! Yesteryear's truth's now principally UNFAIR, not for any reason than the subsidiary : as it no longer provides the wilful nullity its means to life, as it no longer coats upon its will to power... well what good is it ?! And don't say "it's the truth" either. Lmao, fucking hatefacts!</p>
<p>As far as <a href="http://trilema.com/2014/the-all-american-asshole-in-his-own-words-with-my-own-notes/">they</a>'re concerned, really the only item you need to take away from this footnote is that they didn't change their story for the <em>exact same reason</em> everyone else didn't like to hear it all through the IMF's "helpful" existence -- but for "different reasons altogether" (and only a hateful blackguard would either ask what those reasons might be, or say the words "austerity" and "America" in the same sentence, aite ?).
